My time spent yesterday -
Trying to control the way that life would lead me in -
Has somehow failed
And now all I do is try to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt

And now my time spent today -
Fighting to remedy all my mistakes -
Has brought more problems than before -

And still I try to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt

And Ive been sure that Ive had doubts of all the truths that seems to be

My time spent tomorrow -
Will be uselessly hoping to eliminate -
The inevitable

And I'm sure that I'll be trying to find my way out of endless possibilities of doubt

Cause Ive been with, Ive been without all of the things I seem to need

If I keep this pace then I risk everything
Now this overview of solitude has been reviewed

Well, Ive been down and Ive been out
And Ive been sure that Ive had doubts
Cause Ive been with, Ive been without
Yeah, Ive been down and out
