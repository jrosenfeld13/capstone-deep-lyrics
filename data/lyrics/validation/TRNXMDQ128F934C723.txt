[Verse 1]
You remember
The lessons taught in your past
And how old were you
Before you wondered
How many were lies?
They tried to teach you 'bout the anti-Christ
They tried to teach that Christ was nice
Did they say anything about the terms?
That eternal life meant food for worms?

[Chorus]
Don't die for their
Dead religion, dead religion
Die
Dead religion, dead religion
Die

[Verse 2]
Please take my soul
And please control
But would you just please go?
I think it is a-bout time
I wipe my ass with your holy book
God is dead and the Pope's a crook
A blackened heart you claim as pure
You're a plague but we're the cure

[Chorus]
Dead religion, dead religion
Die
Dead religion, dead religion
Die

[Bridge]
I spit on the shit you prophesize
Your apocalypse, a pack of lies

Each generation says their time has come
Clutching at the thread of martyrdom
Each generation says their time has come
Doomsday starts when we kill the sun

Die
Martyr die
Die, martyr, die
Martyr die
Die, martyr, die
Martyr die
Die, martyr, die
And embrace your lonely martyrdom

[Chorus]
Dead religion, dead religion
Die
Dead religion, dead religion
Die

[Verse 3]
What were you told?
How the streets would be paved with gold?
I got news for you
You are the road
Well, I know better, bub
God lives in a nuclear sub
Yeah, your religion is the greatest scam
Cause we're all dead and we're all damned

[Chorus]
In the eyes of your
Dead religion, dead religion
Dead religion, dead religion
Dead religion, dead religion
