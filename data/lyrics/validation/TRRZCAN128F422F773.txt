There I was completely wasting
Out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating
As I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin
To put some action in my life
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
So much for the golden future
I can't even start
I've had every promise broken
There's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like
You don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves
Doing the same thing too
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
Breaking the law
