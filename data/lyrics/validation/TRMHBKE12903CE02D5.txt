Billy Boy Boxer lived a life of hard knocks
And he could never let up
He could never let up
But once he was down, boy he was out
And he could never get up
He could never get up
He thought he had the power to change his life
But he couldn't even do it if he tried
And when he died all his best friends said
That he wasn't that kind of guy

Sally the Kid was scared to raise her eyelids
Cause she was getting older
She was getting older
She cried and she cried as each day flew by
Right over her shoulder
Over her shoulder
She'd always thought she could make it last
But she couldn't even do it if she tried
And when she died all her best friends said
She wasn't living when she was alive

Mr. Ed never lost his head
Cause he was always steady
He was always steady
But when the time hit to call it quits
Old Ed was ever ready
Ed was ever ready
He knew he couldn't fight off his fate
No he couldn't even do it with a voice
But when he died all his best friends said
That he didn't have too much choice
