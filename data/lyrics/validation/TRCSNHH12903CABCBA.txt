Cause we belong together
We make our bed together
In a chemistry set, yes
We make the best of our lives, yes
We make our plans together
We take a chance together
In a chemistry set, yes
We make the best of our lives, yes

Why plastic burn on the other cheek
Your lips hot so they can burn me
Like we poured metals in a wet sink
We're volatile, volatile
But we burn as bright as magnesium
So when I'm away and you feel glum
Remember love in test tube
It's worth a while, worth a while

'Cause we belong together
We make our bed together
In a chemistry set, yes
We make the best of our lives, yes
We slow it down on sundays
Stay out of town on sundays
In a chemistry set, yes
We make the best of our lives, yes

Why plastic burn on the other cheek
Your lips hot, so they can burn me
Like we poured metals in a wet sink
We're volatile, volatile
But we burn as bright as magnesium
So when I'm away and you feel glum
Remember love in test tube
It's worth your while, worth your while
If I'm your acid, you're my alkali

We'll find the right p. h. To make things right
We're subtle differences to make it last
And place our worries firmly in the past
If I'm your acid, you're my alkali
We'll find the right p. h. To make things right
We're subtle differences to make it last
And place our worries firmly in the past
