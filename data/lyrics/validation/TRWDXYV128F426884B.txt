Stand aside for the New World Order
Systematic... aristocratic
Don't deceive yourself; get out of the way
We command and you obey

Beautiful to be the Joker
Cursed by an all too-human future
Things you cannot defeat
You start to believe in:
New generationssynthetic nations!

I am your loving hate...
This is the new world

New World Order!

Old-school fascism is on the rise
Narcissistic... evangelistic
So many things are only here to be hated
No need for love when the world is sedated

Beautiful to be the Joker
Cursed by an all too-human future
The world burns with death as a lover
It's systematic for the coming New World Order!

Worldwide genocide
Mass religious suicide
Immoral seduction
Digital corruption
