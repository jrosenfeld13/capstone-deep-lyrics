Northbound open, use left hand lane
I drive to a place where no one knows who I am
Stop lights broken, tail lights out
I speed without caution on a road made of ice

My body an engine, my car is a train
I don't feel guilty for the hurt or pain
Telephone message, we all ring twice
I speed without caution on a road made of ice
