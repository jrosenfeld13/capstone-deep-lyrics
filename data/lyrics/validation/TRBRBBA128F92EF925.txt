Hard luck and bad news
Has followed me from town to town
All my life my lucks been down
I'm getting so weary
I don't have one friend
Folks turn their backs when i'm around
Where i walk the grass turns brown
No one will come near me

Hard luck and bad news
Hard luck and bad news
If you were in my shoes you'd die

My life's been lonely
I've never heard a kindly word
Ugly names is all i've heard
And mean is how they treat me
Nobody trusts me
They blame me for the fires in town
Claim that hell is where i'm bound
And pray that God will speed me

Hard luck and bad news
Hard luck and bad news
If you were in my shoes you'd die

Life's not worth livin'
My sorrows more than i can say
Tomorrow's just another day
I hate to see the sun rise
Yet maybe someday
I'll find a man to call a friend
I'll be his friend until the end
In loneliness my heart cries

Hard luck and bad news
Hard luck and bad news
If you were in my shoes you'd die
Hard luck and bad news
Hard luck and bad news
If you were in my shoes you'd die
