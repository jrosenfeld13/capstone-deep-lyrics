Slave to good intention
Mastermind the great
A victim to the culprit
Of finding out too late
So I linger in the hallway
One story down below
Longing for a 45 revolver
And a 62 bordeaux

But you're the only one who can please me
You're the only one

I hear the creaks in the floorboards
A firmament above
I can chart the course of your star
Like a dirty hand in glove
And I'm lurking in the holes
Creeping cross the corners
Cuddle up so soft and safe
Close your eyes and calculate

One to nullify the pain
Two to make it real again
Three please give me one to grow on
Four my recompense
Five don't leave me in suspense
Six promise not to peak

My diabolical streak
