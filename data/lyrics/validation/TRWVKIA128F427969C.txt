Love Me Like A Lover

Love me like a lover
Love me like no other
Love me like a lover
Love me like no other

Just because I wear your ring
Doesn't mean I'm on a string
Jumping to your every beck and call
Come and take me out tonight
Bring me home and hold me tight
What I'm asking isn't hard at all

Love me show a little passion
Love me need my daily ration
Love me got to have some action
And a life long satisfaction
Love me like a lover
Love me like no other

Repeat
