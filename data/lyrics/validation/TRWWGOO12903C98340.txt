[Verse 1]
I saw you at the airace yesterday April showers get out of my way
Fear of flying no not me
I'm never bothered what you say someone's kid just lives for today
It ain't your problem anyway

[Chorus]
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way

[Verse 2]
Number one public figure what a pain just puts another rattle in your brain
Take another green but it's not the same
So now you're on the sandlane everyday dancing with the bulls in any old way
Running like a fox to keep up with me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm on 45 between 6th and Broadway, 45 between 6th and Broadway 45
I'm drinking 7UP between 6th and Broadway 7UP between 6th and Broadway, 7UP

[Chorus]
