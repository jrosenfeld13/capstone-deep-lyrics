Bellbottom blues
You made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling

And if I could choose
A place to die
It would be in your arms

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back
Oh I'd gladly do it because

I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

It's all wrong
And it's all right
The way that you treat me baby

Once I was strong
But I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back
Oh I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade way
In your heart I want to stay

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back
Lord I'd gladly do it because
I don't wwant to fade away
No no no
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
It's in your heart I want to stay

Bellbottom blues
Don't you say good bye
Surely gonna meet again
And if we do
Don't you be surprised
To find me with another lover

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back
Lord I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
No no no
Give me one more day please
I don't wanna fade away
No
In your heart I want to stay
I don't want to fade away
Oh no
Give me one more day please
I don't wanna fade away
No no
In your heart I want to stay
I don't want to fade away
No
Give me one more day please
I don't wanna fade away
Oh in your heart is where I want to stay
