Tears in your eyes like a diamond on your face
Leaving behind all the memories you've embraced
It's all so uneasy, this fear of being on your own
It's all the illusion of being alone

The only solution is 2 hold your head up high
Sad's the emotion u must fight

Though time is upon us
We don't have 2 say goodbye
Instead there's tomorrow we'll see u again
Through all the confusion
We won't ever say goodbye
We'll see u 2morrow, beginning 2 end

Where are u now, have u finally found your way?
Do u still remember all the things u tried 2 say?
Now all the expressions are blowing in the wind
& all of your feelings are strangers within

But dont u surrender, dont u ever shed a tear
Love survives

Though time is upon us
We don't have 2 say goodbye
Instead there's tomorrow we'll see u again
Through all the confusion
We won't ever say goodbye
We'll see u 2morrow, beginning 2 end

Now don't u surrender, dont u ever shed a tear
Love survives

Though time is upon us
We don't have 2 say goodbye
Instead there's tomorrow we'll see u again
Through all the confusion
We won't ever say goodbye
We'll see u 2morrow, beginning 2 end
