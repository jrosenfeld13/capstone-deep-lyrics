Staring at the audience
Your head is a cage
Broken thoughts fly over
A familiar stage

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always...

A heart full of rancour
Has made yourself blue
Enlightned by darkness
The fear becomes true

Kept always pretending
That nothing's been done
If your burn with fire, with fire you'll get burnt!

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!

The act was so brilliant
The audience applauds!
You bend down your head and
Deflect any flaws
Inside your heart's freezing
Your mind is a cell
You've swallowed the fire and fire was your spell

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!
