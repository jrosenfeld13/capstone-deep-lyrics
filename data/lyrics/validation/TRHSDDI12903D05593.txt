Well, I'll sit here to convince myself its true
If you keep on telling your friends that we're through

I've got nothing here but loneliness
Holes in walls and bleeding fists
My head is pounding like a pillow
Like a Big Black song

My friends and I try to tell me you're gone
Won't listen to myself or anyone

You got on a plane and off you went
You're never coming back again
I'm trying to convince myself it's true
Convincing myself

I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be here telling myself it's true

Well I sit here to convince myself its true
If you keep on pretending to have no clue

That I'd kill for you and eat the flesh
Give you the heart and burn the rest
A thousand miles ain't shit to walk
If I'm walking to hold you

I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be just fine without you
I'll be here telling myself it's true
