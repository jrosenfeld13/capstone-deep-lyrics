[Chorus]
Casted out
I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my, visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out
I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

Touch with frustrated lips
Love is like starting over
With every step, engraving the problems of memories

[Chorus]

Drunken, failures, regrets
Letters of silence confess, burdens within
Speaking as loneliness listens
While hopelessly feeling

[Chorus]

There's a definite pattern to our behavior
Somehow the end draws us closer

Casting out my visions of nine
Cast it out let ten die with time
Blacking out
Casted out
I'm watching your eyes bled dry

Blacking out
Cast it out
