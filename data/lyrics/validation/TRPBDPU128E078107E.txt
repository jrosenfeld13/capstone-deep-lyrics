When lady luck has got me down with her high speed attitude
Im a feeling kinda high, Im a feeling kinda low
I feel so, I dunno like fast food
Someone spiked my latte and Im just not in the mood
Need a little bit of this, need a little bit of that
Some chit chat and thats why Im the dude
I got a feeling something's wrong
I dial your number and then its gone
I got a feeling something's whack
Before I count to three youre here with me before the blues attack
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Without you girl the futures bleak
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
I want you by my side
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
You got a day, its like the week
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Im feeling good inside
When lady luck is dressed in black
And Im dancing in my shoes
Tryna pull me to the left tryna pull me to the right
I just might, sit tight stay in my groove
Im tired of people on my back
Making offers I can't refuse
I know that they believe Im on my knees
But I know I won't ever leave yeah
I got a feeling some thing's wrong
I dial your number and then its gone
I got a feeling some thing's whack
Before I count three youre here with me before the blues attack
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Without you girl the futures bleak
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
I want you by my side
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
You got a day, its like the week
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Im feeling good inside
Twist it, nation meet the generation
We dont need no education
The rhythm that youre giving me is changing my life
And baby if you said Jump Id say How high?
No dealing, stealing only free wheeling
Youre giving a religion for me to believe in
So rock me, shock me any way you know
But I guess I kinda like the status quo
I got a feeling some thing's wrong
I dial your number and then its gone
I got a feeling some thing's whack
Before I count to three youre here with me before the blues attack
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Without you girl the futures bleak
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
I want you by my side
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
You got a day, its like the week
Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek
Im feeling good inside
