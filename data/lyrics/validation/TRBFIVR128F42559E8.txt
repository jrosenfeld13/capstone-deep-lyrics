[Verse]
To your credit to the thirty faces you created
To your headache to the shape of the 1980's
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more
I'm tired of playing in your fashion war

[Verse]
To the lights to the trend setting in your head
Sunday night tears from youth cults already dead
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more
I'm tired of fighting in your fashion war

[Chorus]
Woh, goodbye seventies [x2]

[Verse]
To your credit to the thirty faces you created
To your subscription for the million copies of 1980
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more
I'm tired of losing in your fashion war

[Chorus]
