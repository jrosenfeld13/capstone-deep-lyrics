Accomplish nothing, as they're longing to be walking like the walking undead
Replaying the same day
I know what's gone, and I know what's left
When all that you once loved has faded away
And all that you longed for in your life has passed you by
Nothing that I know'd enhance comforting
Will it be worth it?
The time spent on this moment?
Counting down the days that I wish would live forever
Oh my
God, what's going on?
My own eyes have seen a third of my blood
I'll know what's gone and I'll know what's left
When all that I once loved has faded away
I'll replay the same day again and again
Over and over until I am dead
I'll die knowing I never waited
