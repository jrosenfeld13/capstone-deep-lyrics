I got a cool head doin' alright
But I been up here so long I was starving
For some hot spells, summer lights
Shinin' on your back roads
Tennessee

Somebody hit me hard
Right in my own backyard
Somebody put a hope lock on my heart
Runnin' down your back roads
Tennessee

Oh you got the banjos
And they play real slow
Not to me, not to me
I never heard such rock and roll
As on your back roads
Tennessee

Now I know you're not to blame
But you know that you should have
Told me
That I would never be the same
After riding down your back roads
Tennessee

Somebody held me tight
Somebody tried to fight
Somebody raced out in the night
Runnin' down your back roads
Tennessee

Oh you kissed the soul of a rebel
In a Yankee girl
You got to me
I heard you callin' 'round the world
From your back roads
Tennessee

I saw somebody standin'
In a field with a crutch
Behind his rich southern daddy
With a Midas touch
They said be outta here by sundown
They said good luck
You might say I was the stranger
Who knew too much

Somebody took a hope lock from my heart
And threw it down your back roads
Tennessee

Oh you feel the north wind blow
That's only me
I want to hear some rock and roll
On your back roads
Tennessee

I'm not the bad city girl
Come down to rape you
I'm not the hometown queen
Who wants to save you
I heard you callin' to my soul
From your back roads
Tennessee
