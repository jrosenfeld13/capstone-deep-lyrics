Boys don't cry, they just want to die
Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie
Will you look into my eyes?
Will you be my new dress?

Box up all of your things with tape
Write your address, hope it won't be late
Can I still be your pessimist?

Boys don't cry, they just want to die
Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie
Will you look into my eyes?
Will you be my new dress?
