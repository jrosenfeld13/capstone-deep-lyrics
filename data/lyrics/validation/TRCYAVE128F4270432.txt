Old man Tyler had a crash in his car
Down on the fortune highway
Doctor said it was his cruel sick heart
Didn't go to church on Sunday

Oh your pace is going to knock you dead
Out of the race you got time to spare
Jerkin' Crocus is the cause of the cross you bear
Didn't you wish you were there

I know what she want
Just a lick of your ice cream cone
I know what you say
Pappas in bed well hey, hey, hey

When he got stuck with a hole in his head
She asked to try it my way
Get down low with all that haughty jive
You don't know what it's like, babe

Oh oh oh it's getting down around here
I got nothing to hide I'm to tired to fear
Jerkin' Crocus didn't kill me but she sure came near
She's a nads puller

I know what she want
A judo hold on a black man's balls
And I know what you think
Ease over baby, going to rock that thing

Alright

I know what she want
Just a lick of your ice cream cone
I know what you say
Papa's in bed well hey, hey, hey

I know what she want
A judo hold on a black mans bones
I know what you think
Ease over baby, going to rock that thing, alright

C'mon Jerkin'
C'mon Jerkin'
I know
No no no no
Alright!
I know
That's better
No no no no
That's much better
