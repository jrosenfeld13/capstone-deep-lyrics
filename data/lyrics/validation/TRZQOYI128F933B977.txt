I know he has forgotten
So I guess I should remind him
That I'm eating all this coal
'Cause I'm trying to make a diamond
Let me on
I swear I won't put a foot wrong
Let me on
I swear I won't put a foot wrong
Clean out your ears
Clean out your ears, love
I know he has forgotten
So I guess I should remind him
That I'm eating all this coal
'Cause I'm trying to make a diamond
Let me on
I swear I won't put a foot wrong
Let me on
I swear I won't put a foot wrong
