Kiss your lashes, kiss you low
I'm driven to you like the driven snow
There's a place for us to lie
For every lover there's a piece of sky

To every life a light that shines
To every heart a beat that's true
Baby you're my yellow summer
You're my winterblue

You know that this was meant to be
Long ago a hundred years from now
Tossing on an open sea
Love so good it's easy to go down

To every life a light that shines
To every heart a beat that's true
Baby you're my yellow summer
You're my winterblue

Love you like a jungle fever
I'll never never never leave
Through every vein and every fibre
I'll never never never leave

To every life a light that shines
To every heart a beat that's true
You're my yellow summer
You're my winterblue
Winterblue, winterblue
