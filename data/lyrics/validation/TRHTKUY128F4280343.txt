I live in a land of hot water
I live in a land of smiles
I live in a land of perfect sunsets
This land I live lies in this land

But what about this thing we wrote this thing we wrote we made
The cost of life the human toll the cost of human lives that we betrayed

I live in a subtle differences
So I can smoke my pipe on my estate
Don't worry brother I'll get you of your cell
Your future meets your pride that's all that remains

But what about this thing we wrote this thing we wrote we made
The cost of life the human toll the cost of human lives that we betrayed

I live in this land you frown upon
I live in this land of hot sand
I live in this land of wrong
This land I live lies in this land
This land I live lies in this land

But what about this thing we wrote this thing we wrote we made
The cost of life the human toll the cost of human lives that we betrayed
