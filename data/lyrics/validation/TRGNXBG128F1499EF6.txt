[Verse 1]
I'd like to think that it's out of fear
When you blow into town, maybe twice a year
To check on me, see if I'm still here
And make me think that it's my idea

[Verse 2]
When everything in the world is free
I come to you so easily
You've never felt a sense of me
You, that I refused to see

[Refrain](x2)
You had me, but it's over now

[Chorus](x2)
It's no problem

[Verse 3]
I'm not really sure why I let you win
Or even why I let it begin
I've always been an easy in
An easy out the door again

[Verse 4]
I know it's only because you're down
That you ever wanna come around
Just a little secret in a little town

[Refrain](x2)

You'll get my attention again somehow

[Chorus](x2)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus](x2)
