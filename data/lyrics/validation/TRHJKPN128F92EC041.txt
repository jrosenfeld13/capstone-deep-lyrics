A thousand nights I've spent alone
Solitaire to the bone
But I don't mind, I'm my own best friend
From the beginning to the end

My life, my heart
Black night, my star
Capricorn, Capricorn

December's child, the only one
What I do is what I've done
I realise, I get so cold
When I was young, I was already old

My life, my heart
Black night, my star
Capricorn, Capricorn
Capricorn, Capricorn

Go

I always knew the only way
Is never live beyond today
They proved me right
They proved me wrong
But they can never last this long

My life, my heart
My love, my star
Capricorn, Capricorn
Capricorn, Capricorn
Capricorn, Capricorn
