You see some people walking just walking on the street
You take your telephone and ring up to me
You take guitar, I take some beer
Rockin' music will never...
Never die!
You see some people on the street
You take your phone and ring to me
We drink some beer well it's all right
We meet some slobs and make a fight
There are always some crazy guys
So rockin' music will never...
Never die!
You've got no f*cking money
You've got a bad headache
Turn on your record player
And dance without break
