I think I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door, that I've been through before
Congratulations, at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the night

I think I'm never coming after, after all

Now I've become the cat
Who always lets you know that

I am, I am stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am stronger without you
I am

For all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold, or the story's never told
Investigation, at last I've found my light
And we shine

So now I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this that

I am, I am stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am better without you
I am

I think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door, that locked me in before
Congratulations, now that you've see my light
After all

And when I become the cat
I'll always let you know that

I am, I am stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am stronger without you
I am

I am, I am brighter than the sun
I am, I am everyone
I am, I am better without you
I am

I am, I am stronger than before
I am, I am more
I am, I am ready to go on
I am
