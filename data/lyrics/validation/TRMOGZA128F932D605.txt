Growing up as a young buck
There wasn't too much that I could touch
And I was in a rush to get a taste of a good life
And people told me I was a waste of a good life
And I would not escape living the hood life
But yo, life is hell and that's grown to be expected
Only way to cope with the pain is to accept it
Times is hectic, we grow up quick
Endure the hardships and watch our skin grow thick
In turn you gotta learn my head's as hard as a brick
So can't nobody ever tell me shit. And that's the truth
As a youth I hated all of you with a passion
Those who never stood in my shoes would be laughing and cracking jokes while their two folks raked in the dough
X-mas 86' niggas has Nintendo
Word is bond, I ain't have shit...I had a pretendo
And at show and tell I ain't have shit to show

This goes out to those who thought shit was sweet
E.T.C. e.town concrete. And yo
Niggas wanna be down w/ me
Word is bond we taking over son, guaranteed
I said you feel this, you watch too closely
Your eyes show it, jealous one's envy
But don't act tough, coz I know you scared of me
Like I said we taking over son, guaranteed

All ya'll niggas fake. Ya'll niggas act too phony
2 years ago you didn't even want to know me
But now look at you, you copy my style
You're lucky enough I let you still be around
To play your weak shows and you weak ass town
We straight up beefing, when you see me I see you peeping. You just mad cause' my team rose while you were sleeping. Center stage, took your limelight mad now you heated
Yo, we taking all your fans I guarantee it

This goes out to those who thought shit was sweet
E.T.C. e.town concrete. And yo
Niggas wanna be down w/ me
Word is bond we taking over son, guaranteed
I said you feel this, you watch too closely
Your eyes show it, jealous one's envy
But don't act tough, coz I know you scared of me
Like I said we taking over son, guaranteed
