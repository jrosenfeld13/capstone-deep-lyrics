You were a friend or maybe a twin
I never really could decide
You came to my door, I was on the floor
I couldn't let you up inside
I didn't mean to let you down
And now I know everything that's good is gone
I couldn't explain when I said you're a pain
I never knew another way
All the times that we saw falling down every hall
The better parts have been erased
I didn't mean to let you down
And now I know everything that's good is gone
I tried to make it happen
I tried to do things right
I swallowed two and thought of you
But never saw your sight
I slept away the summer
I dreamt away the days
But the nightmares came when I woke up
And knew you were away
I didn't mean to let you down
And now I know everything that's good is gone
