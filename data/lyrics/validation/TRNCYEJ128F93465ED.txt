Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight

I thought I was a fool for no one
But ooh, baby I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth?

Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul

Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole

Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
