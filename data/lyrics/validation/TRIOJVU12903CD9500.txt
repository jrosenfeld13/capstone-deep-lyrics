My heart is the bums on the street
With nothing to eat and their dirty hands cupped up
My heart is the squirrels in the park
Late Sunday evening dodging the raindrops
My heart is a barrel on fire
That blows burnin' ashes at a telephone wire
My heart is the avenue wind rattlin' street signs
With its delicate din

What did I do to cause you to leave me?
Girl if you just knew what I'm goin' through
I lost my pride, my head hands in sorrow
Every inch of the city reminds me of you

My heart is the schoolyard so empty
Vacant of smiles and void of all joy
My heart is the ghetto at midnight
Teeming with beats and reverberate fear
My heart is the newspaper blowin'
Down the street when it's snowin' and no ones around
My heart is a saxophone solo from a third story window
Just before dawn

What did I do to cause you to leave me?
Girl if you just knew what I'm goin' through
I lost my pride, my head hands in sorrow
Every inch of the city reminds me of you

My heart is the smell of the sewer
The taste of the lobster, the price of the wine
My heart is the rush of the traffic
The tug of the music, the scene of the crime
My heart is the crowd that keeps cheerin'
The trains by the river, the points that we score
My heart is this wondrous city
With its love and its life
And its oneslammin' door
