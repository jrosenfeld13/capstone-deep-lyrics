[Verse 1]
Success serenades me
And pressures at the door
Broken promise debris
Lie around from my mind war
And my accomplishments interrogating me
Today's become tomorrow before I wanted it to be
Desperate discussions
Disturb the destruction
I assigned in my mind
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm under construction everyone
So you'll have to mind the mess
I'm under some construction

[Verse 2]
I always had to try harder
I never really could keep up
Sitting in the corner
With my illness and bad luck
But in this humble place
I'm feeling like red wine
And I hope to get better with some time
I'll be fine, in some time, I'll be fine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Correction
Modification
Alteration
Construction
And the rituals that soothe and disgust me
Will be gone in some time, I'll be fine
In some time, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm under construction everyone
So you'll have to mind the mess
I'm under some construction

Construction
Feel better with some construction
