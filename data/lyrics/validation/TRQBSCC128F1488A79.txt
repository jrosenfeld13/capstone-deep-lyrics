Sit and wait for the day
Where your life might change
And that day never comes
This is rule number one
All the changes must come from you
Is the second rule
Take a long way round
See the sights, hear sounds
Where you'll go, nobody knows

Been this way
Since the day
I was born
Far away
And the walk
In the rain
Makes you feel
Young again

I assumed
You would be my strength
Oh, how wrong I was
That's the wrong way round
How you need me now
The carrousel keeps turning still

This one cried, this one smiled
But we all felt alive
Like a walk in the rain
Made us feel young again
With the crowd singing "all right now"
As the rain came down
It's a long way home
But we're not alone
Life's carrousel keeps turning still

Life keeps turning around, and around
We keep learning from things we have found
Overground

What a fool
To believe
I could help
You to breathe
Getting cold
In the rain
Makes us feel
Young again

If you go
Take a long way round
You'll be lost then found
It's a long way home
But you're not alone
The carrousel bring you back again

Winter comes
We don't have a choice
As we grow
We will find a voice
She looks over her shoulder
The swimming pool freezes over
We'll skate to the other side
Full of life
Still filled with pride
