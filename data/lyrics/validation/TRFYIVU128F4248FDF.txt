Go on and pull yourself up
We climb we climb we climb we climb
Down there they'll get you down there
Again and again forever and ever

Go on and give it a tug
Go on pull up I know it's tough
Down there is deeper than deep
That hole is so steep and things are heavier

Hear it now the night is calling us
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We raise the dead!

The dark is plaguing our hearts
Pumping through us and collecting in our deepest parts
Down there it's dripping like tar
Well it's stuck to your arms
And it's sticking to you too long

This time is higher than high
Something lurking in your shadows
And it's trying too hide
Oh no! We want it alive!
Trick it out trick it out trick it out of your insides

Hear it now the night is calling us
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We raise the dead!

All our friends have met their ends
And father demons tonight

Go on and pull yourself up up up
Go on pull up, I know it's tough
Down there they get you down there
Again and again forever and ever

Hear it now the night is calling us
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We raise the dead!

We're all together now!
We're all together now!
