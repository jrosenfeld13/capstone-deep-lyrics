This morning comes a step too soon
A lonely gaze, and empty room
You're a far cry
A distant memory

But something inside of me always knew this
I'd be standing here without you

As if nothing's happened
As if nothing's wrong
The world seems to move on, the world carries on

I'll starve for your love, hungry I fall
As if nothing's happened
Nothing at all

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
