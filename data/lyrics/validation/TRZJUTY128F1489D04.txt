Blind man
Look and see man
Keeping my blinders as long as i can
Finding my way with the touch of your hand
No need for you to mention
The need for my ascension
My hands my father's hands
Look at all the things that he can't stand
Like my definition of being a man
No need for you to mention
The need for my ascension
Heartless
My typical slowness
Thinking of things that had destroyed us
A broken heart can never be trusted
No need for you to mention
The need for my ascension
Clearly
I love you so dearly
But no inspiration hears me
Something that i fear sincerely
No need for you to mention
The need for my ascension
