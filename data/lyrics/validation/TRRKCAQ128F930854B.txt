I expect, or rather, I confess, a year ago or less
I'd reject a fool like you right out of hand
I'd kick you off your barstool and I'd
Send you off to play with your one man band
I had a touch more self respect, I guess
But the glass is getting empty and I can't hold back the sand

So drink up, drink up, I'll give you what I've got
And if you're really lucky, well, it might feel like a whole lot
So gimme your best line, and I'll give you my best shot
The night may still, the night may still be young, but I am not

You said, or rather, you implied a skillful use of the art
You'd expect a fool like me to understand
I ought run and hide
Spend this Friday night tucked up safe inside
You'll have to think again my friend, I guess
But the clock is spinning swiftly and I can't hold back the hand

So drink up, drink up, I'll give you what I've got
And if you're really lucky, well, it might just feel like a lot
So gimme your best line, and I'll give you my best shot
The night may still, the night may still be young, but I am not
The night may still, oh, the night may still be young, but I am not
