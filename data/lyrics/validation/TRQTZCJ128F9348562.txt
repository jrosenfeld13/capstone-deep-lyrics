(Lars Frederiksen)
Where's my girl where has she gone
She once was beautiful and innocent
I can't believe in what she says
I Look at her and she looked the other way

Disconnected - from feeling alright
Disconnected - and it ain't black and White
Disconnected - there's a sword Through the dove
Disconnected from The country I love

(Matt Freeman)
I remember you when you were young and strong
In your summer dress and your legs so Long
My memories are only for me I Prefer them To reality

Disconnected - from feeling alright
Disconnected - and it ain't black and White
Disconnected - there's a sword Through the dove
Disconnected from The country I love

(Tim Armstrong)
You think it was over, but you better think again
Neither grace nor sweetness, just malicious intent
It's you and me baby, so we better watch our back
Cause If we're standing together we ain't never
Gonna crack
And we took the greyhound into the night
With the city on the left, and the country on the right
And I knew when I saw you, i read it in your eyes
I heard your voice break when you were trying not to die

Disconnected - from feeling alright
Disconnected - and it ain't black and White
Disconnected - there's a sword Through the dove
Disconnected from The country I love
