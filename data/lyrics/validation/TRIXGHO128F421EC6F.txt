Today ? lilies
The roses gone
The flowers line the walks
And the mourners come

The house of kings and queens
That stood so strong
But tonight, tonight
The temple comes down

It's time that we replace the idols that have pulled us down
It's time to burn so we can build again tonight
Temple comes down

Now look at the stars
In their flickering lights
Our bright neighbors
After dayfall time

We reach for their heights
And they pass us by
But tonight, tonight
The temple comes down

It's time that we replace the idols that have pulled us down
It's time to burn so we can build again tonight
Temple comes...

These hands of mine are gonna scale your walls
Shake your foundations and tear your temple down

We've come to be
The flourishing ?
? rituals
In our place

We're the rats that join the piper
We're the lambs led to your slaughter
When we wake up, when we look round
Gonna tear your temple down x2

It's time to reap so we can sow again on fertile ground
It's time to burn so we can build again tonight
Temple comes...

It's time that we replace the idols that have pulled us down
It's time to burn so we can build again tonight
Temple comes down
Temple comes down
Temple comes down
