I've been a wild, wild rover
Sailed all over the sea
But this thing that makes me wonder
Has made a fool of me

For it took me from my childhood
Underneath the stars and skies
And I hear the wind whistling through the wild wood
Whispering goodbye

And it's home, boys, home
It's home, boys, home
It's home, boys, home
When you're far across the foam

And if you see my mother
Tell her I'm keeping fine
Will you tell her that I love her
And I'll try and write sometime

If you see my mother
Give her all of my love
For she has a heart of gold there
As good as God above

And it's home, boys, home
She's home, boys, home
It's home, boys, home
When you're far across the foam

Oh there's no place like home

And if you see my old one
Will you tell her I'm keeping fine
Will you tell her that I love her
And I'll try and write sometime

And it's home, boys, home
It's home, boys, home
It's home, boys, home
When you're far across the foam
