[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
Feel the speed through the intersection
In sheets of rain, I seek out cars
Hands in love with handlebars
Ride alone to the pub in the dark
I get a little wet but I don't have to park
And the lights they start flashing green and red as I ride
A car turns left and I slide
I can't turn back, I make contact
Blinkers smash into a mosaic
And I start flying

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
Always think we'll get more time
Now flying through the air
Maybe living, maybe dying
In this motor crash, it's you who comes to mind
Don't we always wish we had more time?

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
I'm thrust slow-mo through time and space
Details smash, protect my face
And then I see yours
And go to a time when we just knew
Mr. Death in the car below
Doesn't even slow and away he goes
In the majesty of a motor crash
You skid into my darkness forming
Sex and death, heartbreak and strife
Well, they give no warning

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
Always think we'll get more time
Now I'm flying through the air
And it's you who comes to mind
In the red lights and cathedrals, there's a sign
Don't we always wish we had more time?

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
Here it comes, my hit-and-run

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
Always think we'll get more time
Then you're flying through the air
With someone on your mind
In the shattered glass refractions, there's a sign
'Cause you were there
And I wish we had more time

[Verse 3: Stephan Jenkins]
I come down hard and roll to my feet
And rain washes blood now off concrete
People turn away and I just had to laugh
'Cause I'm still flying
Living and dying

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
Always think we'll get more time
You're flying through the air
With someone on your mind
And this motorcycle crash, it is a sign
'Cause you were there
And I wish we had more time

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
(You were there) Mr. Death for what he's done
'Cause I got to walk away from my hit-and-run
Mysteries are not so empty now as they seemed
'Cause I saw you
At my hit-and-run
At my hit-and-run
At my hit-and-run
