Lay your body down
We'll go so deep until we drown
We'll do everything
'Cause I'm your yang and you're my yin
Read my lips and read my eyes
I'll fit to any size
If you sleep with me you'll be
A slave of ecstacy

Get away, get away
Out of my life
Get away, get away
Take the overdrive
Get away, get away
Out of my heart
Get away, get away
'Cause we gotta part

I don't need your love anymore
Get away - and take the back door

Fall into my hands
It's a song that never ends
Hold me close - hold me tight
Make you feel like dynamite
Take me low - fly me high
There's no limit but the sky
I don't care what you might do
When I fall for you

Get away, get away
Out of my life
Get away, get away
Take the overdrive
Get away, get away
Out of my heart
Get away, get away
'Cause we gotta part

I don't need your love anymore
Get away - and take the back door
