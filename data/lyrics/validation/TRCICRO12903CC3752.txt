Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows

You took my love for granted
But I just didn't tell you so
You kick me like a football
And then you just tell me go
The people think ours a love story
Like Juliet and Romeo
They only see your good side
But the other side I know, oh

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows
You kiss me, hug me
But it's only one big show
But who knows
Only heaven knows

There's nothing you can tell me
That can hurt me anymore
I've taken all the insults
Don't anybody know
I have never seen a good time
And you're only seventeen
You hurt me and you hurt me
Yet you're everybody's scene, oh

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows
You kiss me, hug me
But it's only one big show
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Whoo!
Only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

There's nothing you can tell me
To hurt me anymore
I've taken all the insults
Don't anybody know
The people think ours a love story
Like Juliet and Romeo
They only see your good side
But the other side I know, oh

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows
You kiss me, hug me
But it's only one big show
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows

You took my love for granted
But I just didn't tell you so
You kick me like a football
And then you just tell me go
The people think ours a love story
Like Juliet and Romeo
They only see your good side
But the other side I know, oh

Give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows
You kiss me, hug me
But it's only one big show
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

Oh, give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Oh, give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows

Oh, give me back my love
You've turned it to a poppy show now
But who knows
Only heaven knows
