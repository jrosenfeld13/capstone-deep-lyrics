They call me Lullaby
cause all I want and all I know is only to fly
They call me Lullaby

I've never seen their blood
I've never seen that sparkle in their eyes
I don't know
What's hidden in their minds
They call me lullaby

One day I saw a man
Trying to wash away the dirt on his hands
And the pain on his face and when he saw me
He wished that he could cry
And he called me Lullaby

And first of all we were born to be free
And as far as I can see
There's one way this could be
I've been told we were born to be free
And as far as I can see
There's one way this could be

But they struggle and they fight
They weep but they still try
Everything that they can
Everything that they can
And they call me Lullaby

And they wish they would they have
Everything that they can
Everything that they can
And they call me Lullaby

And so me
I'll fly, I'll fly
Just like a lullaby
Just like a lullaby
Until the day I'll die
Oh me
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly
Like a lullaby
Like a lullaby
Until the day I'll die
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly
