[Verse 1:]
I kick myself 'till I'm blue in the face
Gonna find with you
Things are gonna change
That all we had won't go to waste, oh no

I look you straight into your eyes
You can't help
But turn to the side
So I won't see those pair of lies, oh no

[Chorus:]
(Ohh)
I'm done waiting
You think you play me
Well, I don't want to be the one
To tell you that I'm onto you

(Ohh)
Words mean nothing
With your sweet talking
Well, I don't want to be the one
To tell you that I'm onto you

[Verse 2:]
I try to move on
But you won't let me go
You always show up as if you know
That I'm about to get up on my own, oh no

You're hoping things won't be the same
We're over, baby
Walk away
Now you keep calling
But it's just too late, oh no

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I've heard it all a thousand times
You're throwing out the hook and line
But I'm not gonna fall this time

I'm over it
I'm over you
I'm done with this
I'm onto you
So pack it up
'Cause now we're through

[Repeat Chorus:]
