Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh...
Oh-ho, oh-ho, baby, oh-oh-oh, yeah...

[Verse 1]
In the twinkling of an eye
Girl, you had me hypnotized
And I didn't care a thing about love
But I quickly start believin'
'Cause I found myself a reason in you
Yeah, I got a thang for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I think
Think of the way I used to be
I was always all alone
Always doing something wrong
And when I think
Think of the change you brought to me
Girl, I wonder why it took you so long

[Chorus]
Well alright
Well okay, baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
Well alright
Well okay, baby
I finally done me something right
I got you, got you, got you in my life

Got you, got you, got you in my life
Got you in my life

[Verse 2]
It was deep within my heart
Where the feelin' had to start
I had reason to believe it was love
And I'm sure that's what it was
'Cause I've never felt so much in me
Yeah, you brought love into me

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I think
Think of they way things used to be
I was always much too cold
I was always all alone
And when I think, baby
Think of the love you brought to me
I don't konw how I could ever got along

[Chorus]
Well alright, alright
Well okay, okay
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
Well alright, alright
Well okay, okay
I finally done me something right
I got you, got you, got you in my life

[Bridge]
In this wake of happiness
I can't help but feel blessed
From you, baby
'Cause of you, girl
For the first time in my life
I know I've done it right
I fell in love with you, oh...

[Chorus]
Well alright
Well okay, baby
I finally done me something right
Yeah, I got you in my life
Well alright, alright
Well okay, okay
I finally done me something right
I got you, got you in my life

Well alright, alright, baby
Well okay, okay, baby
I finally done me something right
Yeah, I got you in my life
Well alright
Well okay
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life

Well alright, alright
Well okay, okay
I finally done me something right
Yeah, I got you, got you in my life
Well alright, alright
Well okay, okay...
