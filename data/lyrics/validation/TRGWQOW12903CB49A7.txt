[Verse 1]
I dreamt I was a child holding a string into the sky
Climbing it 'til I finally reached the other side
A city of gold, a beautiful noise, a blanket of sound
Covering me, pulling the sky into the ground

[Chorus]
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins

[Verse 2]
I stand on the air, hovering high over the earth
I stare at the star as she is waiting to give birth
You are the voice that I can hear, now I can see
I am a photograph of who I used to be

[Chorus]
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins
I get carried away
Please warm the blood inside my veins
