Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain a-fallin'
Seem to hear your voice callin', it's all right

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I feel like it's rainin', rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' in the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain through the night

A rainy night in Georgia
Oh, a rainy night in Georgia
And I feel like it's rainin', rainin' all over the world

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take out my guitar and pass some time
Late at night it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
I feel fine

Oh, a rainy night in Georgia
Oh, a rainy night in Georgia
And I feel like it's rainin', rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
