I'm turning it on
I see familiar strangers, from a sightless pair
I came without warning, i don't play fair
Shotgun - you're on the run, can't you feel me getting closer
Stand back - surprise attack, ultrasonic spectacle

Plunging into the fire, never losing sight
Blinded by your desire, electrifiesd in the night, in the night

Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment

Convulsive heartthrob, flash in the air
A bolt from the blue laser-beam stare
Blackout - i hear you shout
Phantom schemes that drain more power
Flashback, we made a pact, now we want the pay-off

Plunging into the fire, never losing sight
Blionded by your desire, electrifiesd in the night, in the night

Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment

I'm coming out in sight, alive and shocking
I'll materialize, i'm turning it on for you

Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment

Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
Shock treatment, i'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
