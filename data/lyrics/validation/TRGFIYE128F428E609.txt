Night and day
You are the one
Only you
Beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows
Where ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night

Night and day

You are the one
Only you
Beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows
Where ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Night and day
