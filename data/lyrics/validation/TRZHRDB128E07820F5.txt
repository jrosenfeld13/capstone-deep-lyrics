You said the things you did in the past
Were all because you're living too fast
But now I'm here you're taking it slow
You know what you know you know you don't know
I only want to be with you
You do you do you do you do too
You do you do you do you do too
But I'm so happy just to be with you
I knew what you knew what you knew you knew too
Ah

You said that time you didn't love me
Although I'd been the cutest you'd seen
But would the past have changed even though
You know what you know you know you know now
I only want you by my side
Some kinds of pride I just can't hide
Some kinds of pride just can't be denied
But I know that oh no no no
