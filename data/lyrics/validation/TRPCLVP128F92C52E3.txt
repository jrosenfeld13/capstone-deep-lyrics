Woke up on a winters day
On a long an lonesome road
Thinking about what I left behind

Wishing him on this winters day
Finding something nice I could say
But for now, but for now I'll be wishing him away
But for now, but for now I'll be wishing him away

Warming up this wagon bug
Thinking where to pass some time
Like they say out of site out of mind

Wishing him on this winters day
Finding something nice I could say
But for now but for now I'll be wishing him away

Keeps pulling me in and pulling me out
I'm fading in I'm fading out
Keeps pulling me in and pulling me out
I'm fading in I'm fading out
Keeps pulling me in and pulling me out
I'm fading in I'm fading out
Keeps pulling me in and pulling me out
I'm fading in I'm fading out

Wishing him on this winters day
Finding something nice I could say
But for now but for now I'll be wishing him away
But for now but for now I'll be wishing him away
But for now but for now I'll be wishing him away
