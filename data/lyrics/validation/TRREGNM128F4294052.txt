No one's got it quite like I do
A shiny moment
Something the cling to
Something to live for
You just flew off in the sky like that
I don't even want you back
One more shot at redemption
Followed by a last temptation
And I'm a sucker
I'll take a big bite out of it
Savoring every bit

How we gonna keep things running round here?
How we gonna keep 'em up and running round here?
How we gonna keep things running round here?
Oh dear
Oh dear

How we gonna keep things running round here?
(In the middle lf the night I'm talking)
How we gonna keep 'em up and running round here?
(I'm wondering to myself)
How we gonna keep things running round here?
Oh dear
Oh dear

How we gonna keep things running round here?
(In the middle on the night I'm walking)
How we gonna keep 'em up and running round here?
(I'm mumbling to myself)
How we gonna keep things running round here?
My dear
My dear

How we gonna keep things running round here?
