Can't save it or heat it up
Just another day drowning in rain
We're scratched and broken down
I hope we'll always stay the same

Remember what we had
Sleepless nights and endless days
Feels like we're locked in a cell
Everything turns into a haze

Not looking back, I watched all the lights go down
So fast, uha but I'm coming back
What the heck? What the heck?
And I'm moving step by step, what the heck?

We'll get what we deserve
Who ever told things would be great
You know what? You know it's true
It's hard to find someone like you

Not looking back, I watched all the lights go down
So fast, uha but I'm coming back
What the heck? What the heck?
And I'm moving step by step, what the heck?

We'll get what we deserve
Who ever told things would be great
You know what? You know it's true
It's hard to find someone like you

Not looking back, I watched all the lights go down
So fast, uha but I'm coming back
What the heck?

Keep on, keep moving on, keep on and on
And I'm moving step by step, what the heck?
Come save it or heat it up just another chance
To wash away our make up

I'm glad, you'll try
I hope we'll always stay the same

Not looking back, I watched all the lights go down
So fast, uha but I'm coming back
What the heck? What the heck?
And I'm moving step by step, what the heck?

We'll get what we deserve
Who ever told things would be great
You know what? You know it's true
It's hard to find someone like you

Not looking back, I watched all the lights go down
So fast, uha but I'm coming back
What the heck?

Keep on, keep moving on, keep on and on
And I'm moving step by step, what the heck?
Come save it or heat it up just another chance
To wash away our make up
