And she asked me where have you been?
I could've sworn i lost you again
My reply
Why do you still pretend
That you forgot me?

When my world began to fall
I had to turn and run
When my world began to fall
My cries echoed on and on

Melancholy got in my throat
Sadness alone would never change me
But someday
Yeah maybe someday
Soon you won't have to find me

When my world began to fall
I had to turn and run
When my world began to fall
My cries echoed on and on

And she asked me where have you been?
I could've sworn i lost you again
My reply
Why do you still pretend
That you forgot me?

That you forgot me (4x)

When my world began to fall
I had to turn and run
When my world began to fall
My cries echoed on and on
