Don't walk away
Don't walk away

Not now that I'm inspired
Oh
Won't you stay
Please
Won't you stay

Come on
Girl
Come around now
Don't walk away
Don't walk away

Not now that I'm inspired
Oh
Won't you stay
Please
Won't you stay

Your love it takes me higher
You built me up
Make me feel I was good enough to be your guy

Now you've changed your mind
Girl
Couldn't decide if your love was all in my mind
But in my heart too - I believe in you
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
. . 
Don't let me down
Promise me you'll be around

I'll take the lie - just say that you'll try
Girl
Over the year I've cried twenty million tears

But in one day you washed them all away
Yeah
If I ever get another chance

I'm gonna get you really gonna love you
We can start a new romance - say you'll be mine
Don't you walk away
Don't turn your back on me

Don't walk away
Girl
Don't walk away
Girl

Don't you walk away
Don't you walk away
Hey girl

Listen to me
Girl
Don't turn your back on me
Now that you got me inspired
Don't you walk away
Don't you walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
. . 
Don't walk away
Don't walk away

Not now you got me inspired
