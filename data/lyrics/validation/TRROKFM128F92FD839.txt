[Chorus 1]
Monday, Tuesday, three days and more
Pretty soon you don't know anymore
Friday, the sixth day, Saturday seems late
Don't know how much longer I can wait

[Chorus 2]
Oh, could you wait until I get home
Oh, we need to be alone
'N' I don't want to lose
My love on the telephone

[Verse 1]
You make me nervous because the line's engaged
I can't believe we let it get to this stage
Sitting here waiting for you to give me a sign
You know I got my heart on the line
Oh, I know that I was wrong
Oh, I've been away too long
I can't stand to lose
My love on the telephone
Hello operator
You know that I've been waiting on this call
I said, hey, operator
If you're giving me a bad time
I'm going to tear this phone right off the wall

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm running out of time
Oh, my heart is on the line
'N' I don't want to lose
My love on the telephone
Oh, maybe I was wrong
Oh, I've been away too long
'N' I can't stand to lose
My love on the telephone

[Chorus 2]
