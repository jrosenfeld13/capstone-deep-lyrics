How did u break upon It's time 2 get adjusted
It's time 2 break the mould And sink the best of all U see that's come and gone I've tried 2 take it 2 u Be brave with what is new
It's time 2 break the mould And sink the best of all U see that's come and gone Yeah! Well I see u break through
Yeah! Well I see you're fair
I see your absent head You've become apathetic
Your inhibitions starve U never move 2 far 2 see your shadows burning
I've tried 2 take it 2 u Be brave with what is new
Who broke your wings Your star It didn't shine 2 far It's sugar coated now
IT'S OLD AGAIN
It's time 2 go u have 2 know!
