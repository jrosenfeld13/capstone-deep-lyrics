There's a cross that stands before me
And a light that guides my way
So, I'll keep my eyes on Jesus
Until the Judgment Day

There's a road that lies before me
And the path I choose to take
Is the one that leads to mercy
And the way that leads to grace

I will call upon His name
With a fervor like a flame
I will fall on my knees
With my eyes looking up
To the cross that bears His name
To the one who stays the same
To the cross that bears
The name of the Son

Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord
Sweet Lord
I call Your name

I will call upon His name
With a fervor like a flame
I will fall on my knees
With my eyes looking up
To the cross that bears His name
To the one who stays the same
To the cross that bears
The name of the Son

There's a cross that stands before me
So, I'll keep my eye son Jesus
