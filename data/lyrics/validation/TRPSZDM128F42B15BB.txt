When you're feeling sad and lonely
And you're troubled too
Dont believe a word i'm saying
Cause it's never true
I dont know what bought you here
But i know what to do

You can let the music play (music play)
We can dance all day
Straight into the night
Day is done
With other sun to rise

When your lucky is running out
And you feel you dont belong
Everything you've tried to do
Just seems to come out long

I dont wanna push you

But you know you can go on (got to)

Let the music play
We can dance all day
Straight into the night
Day is done
With other sun to rise

Let the music play
We can dance all day
Straight into the night
Day is done
With other sun to rise
