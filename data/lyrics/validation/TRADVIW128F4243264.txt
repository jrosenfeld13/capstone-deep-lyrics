Sad as it seems
Nothing lasts forever
Still the trails of souls survive
Silence the screams
Something has to save us
From the pain of suicide

We see the warning sign
Seems we always wait for someone to die
For no reason

Fighters
You always said the face of death
Would soon arrive
Runners
Until the end
Pray for new life to begin

Lakes of frozen tears
Lifeless souls lie empty
And their trust forever bleeds
Mirrors hide fears
The flames are never ending
In the face of your disease

See the wall
Standing strong against the fortress
And the wounds they hide
Will shine in the killing season

Fighters
You always said the face of death
Would soon arrive

Liars
We know you well
In hate you dwell
But we'll decide

Criers
They have failed you
Now they tell you
You won't survive

Runners
Until the end
Pray for new life to begin

Sad as it seems
Nothing lasts forever
Still the trails of souls survive
Silence the screams
Something has to save us
From the pain of suicide

You see the glory of the world
Beneath your darkness
And the setting sun
By which you'll burn
For treason
