You?re tryin? to be a player, runnin? wit your crew
Hustlin? all the ladies, actin? like a fool
Yea, boy ya gotta know
I don?t need another Romeo
But I really wanna take ya home

(Chorus)
Cause when I get you all alone (all alone)
And the lights are way down low
I?m gonna make you say oh! oh!
Feels so good
Gonna make you say oh! oh! (yea) (yea)
Feels so good

Before the night is over
I?ll be in control
Because I?m gonna show ya
Love you?ve never known
Baby I?m the one you?ll be thinking about all the time
You won?t ever get me off ya mind

(Chorus)
Cause when I get you all alone (so alone)
And the lights are way down low
I?m gonna make you say oh! oh!
Feels so good (feels so good)

Gonna make you say oh! oh! (hey yea)
Feels so good (yea)(yea)

This could be love
If we both trust our hearts
Take my love inside and don?t be afraid to be mine (mine yea)

(Chorus)
Cause when I get you all alone (get you all alone)
And the lights are way down low (way,way,way down baby)
I?m gonna make you say oh! oh! (gonna make you say)
Feels so good (I feel so good)
Gonna make you say oh!oh!
Feels so good

Cause when I get you all alone (all alone, all alone)
And the lights are way down low (way,way,way)
I?m gonna make you say oh!oh!
Gonna make you say
Feels so good (gonna make you say) (yea!)
Gonna make you say oh! oh! (ooo-oo) feels so good
(yea yea yea)
