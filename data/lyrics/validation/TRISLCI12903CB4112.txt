I blew my last five on a cheap fifth of vodka
Gonna kill somethin'
There ain't nothing gonna stop us tonight
I know about confusion
Lets start a riot
Lets start a war
Everybody that you know is a whore

Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, I don't care
If there's gonna be blood, we'll be there

I know about confusion
Turn on all the lights
So I can watch it die
I'm gonna taste some blood
Before they close my eyes
Because I got the answer
One bullet

I know ..how you feel

Cut out my eyes...So I can't see
The cold thing that's swallowing me

We're meat and that's it
So lets fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
