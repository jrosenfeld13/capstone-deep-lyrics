Mother will look with me
Father will pray for me
Religion will wait for me
Nobody waits for this long can't you see
Doors will do for me
What sinners could never dream
Science is in your head
Nobody hurts them selves but themselves can't you tell?
Haters will love in time
And lovers will feel their crime
Patience is all you need
That and the courage it takes just to be
One more day is not enough to change the world
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
One way is not enough to change
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
Yes she will lead me there
And you won't be anywhere
I'll find a quiet path
Somewhere alone where the shadows won't laugh
One more day is not enough to change the world
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
One way is not enough to change
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
Mother will look with me
Father will pray for me
Religion will wait for me
Nobody waits for this long can't you see
Yes she will lead me there
And you won't be anywhere
I'll find a quiet path
Somewhere alone where the shadows won't laugh
One more day is not enough to change the world
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
One way is not enough to change
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
But we'll rise and fall just like the setting sun
