I decided to go out tonight
Even when I drink, nowhere to hide!
Death there
Death there
Everything's dying now, and supposed to go in flames

[Chorus]
What will bring you the vengeance?
What will bring you the death?
What will bring you the happiness?
I will push you off the edge

[end of Chorus]
Twist around the knife in your friend
Look in my eyes as you die
Seeing your life fade away
I'll haunt you for life

Is it there?
A sense of death?
Your god is dead
Awake am I!
What you fear, I'll make it more
And what you need, I need more!

I decided to go out tonight
Even when I drink, nowhere to hide!

Dying there
Dying there
Everything is dying now, as a cost of human ways

[repeat Chorus 2 time]
This is not, end of God
Way to live, as you die!
Say goodbye or you will overcome my lies!
Come with me, after them
Is it clear?
I need help!
Would you need, other deaths?
I'll make it more, when we die!
