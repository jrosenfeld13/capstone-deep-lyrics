Is this sunlight I do see, when I'm left with you

If I could tell you with just one thing, thats all I'd have to do

My eyes, be with you

Can't forget this time I've left, it's all I left to see

If I could stare out into one, you'd be only with me

My eyes, be with you

My eyes, be with you

Oooooooooo..

Ohhhhh oh oh oh oh oh...
