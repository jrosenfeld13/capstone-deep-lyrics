I took your love, and said goodbye
I stayed away, my darling, and made you cry
If you turn me away, yeah
All I can say is that two wrongs dont make a right

I broke your heart, you know its true
Now Im back here to you
Now if you turn me away, yeah
All I can say is that two wrongs dont make a right

Now is your chance to do me wrong
And to tell me that this is the end
Now life, you can forgive, til the longest day I live
I will never make that same mistake again

I took your love and said goodbye
I stayed away, my darling, and made you cry
If you turn me away, yeah
You know all I can say is that two wrongs dont make a right
You know that two wrongs dont make a right
If you turn me away
All I can say is that two wrongs dont make a right
