An anomalous host emerges
From the breach in the collective conscious
Spreading relentless callousness
In the benevolently open minds

Raptured and indignified
Become like the keeper
And send his message forth
Become like the keeper
Harrow all those to cause Turmoil

Anchorless madness
Now adrift in torrents of carnage
A searing voice of screeching razors
Disseminating his verdict under the snapping of cartilage
Debilitate and torture the very body of all creation

Engrave our flesh with anger
His throes are ours to spread
Derail their train on thought
Its consequence, our intent

Inhaling every soul
We mould his thought
Gather - devour
We mould into his form

Shedding light as fire for the moths
For the meek who will take no part
Let them wander in their delusions
While we are in the shade of truth

Shedding light as fire for the moths
For the weak who will take no part
Let them rot in their delusions
We draw you in to burn in our illusions

Excise the book of creation
An Odious emanation formed
Ostracise this worthless defamation
An Odious emanation reborn

Become like the keeper
Harrow all those to cause
Turmoil

An anomalous host emerges
From the breach in the collective conscious
Spreading relentless callousness
In the benevolently open minds
Odious emanation
