She do nothing for me
I lay on my back
And she stand on my knee
She do nothing to me

Hates my face
In the face of defeat

I wish I'd never ever
Heard that song before

She do nothing for me
I feel a strength come
I'm evil and strong
She mean nothing to me

I slide through sand
Just like water in sand
Oh, and darling now you
Know you just mean nothing to me

Guess I'm nervous, I sway
I bob in the wind
And I change like the day
But she do nothing for me

I stand and I scream
She give nothing to me

Oh and darling this should
Surely be our finest hour
