Lonesome train on a lonesome track
I'm going away, ain't coming back
I'm going somewhere far from my baby
On a lonesome train, on a lonesome track
Lonesome train on a lonesome track
Got all my troubles in one big pack
My baby left me so sad and lonely
On a lonesome train, on a lonesome track

Lonesome train on a lonesome track
My girl don't love me and that's a fact
No use in living, no use in dying
On a lonesome train, on a lonesome track
Oh, lonesome train, on a lonesome track
I want my baby, I want her back
Don't want to go on forever travelling
On a lonesome train, on a lonesome track
