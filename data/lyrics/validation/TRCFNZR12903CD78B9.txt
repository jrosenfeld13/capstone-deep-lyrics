Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win

It's just a matter of time
Before you make up your mind
To give all that love that you've been hiding
It's just a question of when
I've told you time and again
I'll get all the love you've been denying

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in (Girl, you got to give in)
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya (Oh, yeah)
Sooner or later, love is gonna win

You say you'll never be mine
But, darling, there'll come a time
I'll taste all that love that you've been hiding
It's just a question of time
Before you make up your mind
And give all that love you've been denying

(You've been looking for love)
In all the wrong places
(You've been looking for love)
All the wrong faces
(Gotta get ya, girl)
On this illusion
(Gonna save your heart)
From all this confusion

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in (You got to give in)
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win
Love is gonna win

It's just a matter of time (A matter of time)
Before you make up your mind (Make up your mind)
To give all the love that you've been hiding
It's just a question of when
I've told you time and again
I'll get all the love you've been denying

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in (Baby, baby, got to give in)
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win
Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win
