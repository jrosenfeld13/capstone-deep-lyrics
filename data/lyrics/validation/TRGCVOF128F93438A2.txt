I was bruised and battered, couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable even to myself
Saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face
Oh, brother, you're gonna leave me wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of my friends vanished and gone
At night I hear the blood coursing through my veins
Just as black and whispering as a cold, cold rain
On the streets of Philadelphia
Oh, my, my, my, my

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
Oh, my clothes don't even fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just trying to slip this skin, woh-woh

Take it the night has fallen, I'm still lying here awake
And I can feel myself slowly slipping away
Oh, receive me, my brother, with your faithless kiss
Or else we're gonna leave each other all alone right here like this
On the streets of Philadelphia
Ooh, my, my, my, my

On the streets of Philadelphia
In the City of Brotherly Love
Ooh, my, my, my, my
On the streets of Philadelphia
Ooh, my, my, my
Ooh, my, my, my
