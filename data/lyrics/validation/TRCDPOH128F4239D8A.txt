One man say, restore the peace by any means
Shoot first, then question your enemies
Look how the people been suffrin'
Before now, this a for even more
As they try to mediate between the rich and the poor
Them never used to visit such community
Them never insure them sa-fe-ty
Can you stop the love of the people
Where you know their every cry
Where they all have justice

Justice

Will the people want an end to brutality
Tell dem all they should respect humanity
When you're out there it's nothing but insanity
You massacre your own and that's the reality
Oh Buju Banton, me don't know partiality... I
Iya Iya Iya, I...

Justice

Now look at the way they treat the people
People of the island can't take this here hassle
Everyday to suffer, is Jah-mon, it is a struggle
Look at how the people them work hard and juggle
Some a dem a hustle, and some a dem a love
Some a dem a brag, and nuff a dem a buss
Listen to the rude boy while I toss
The people they want justice

Justice
