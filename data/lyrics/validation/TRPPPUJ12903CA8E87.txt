It's late
Im stray
Im thinking about where we can go tonight
This place
I love
Will make us forget everything
Cos all
I want
Is to hear that music pumping
Cos all
I need
Is too hear the kick drum
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
We can listen as the world goes crazy
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
Every hour to end today
This is the last song
And thats okay so
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Its out
Let go
Cos we are shaking the floor tonight
So loud
We're so close
We are all about to lose control
And i
Well i can feel it rushing up
Inside my mind
Everybody on your feet now
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
We can listen as the world goes crazy
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
Every hour to end today
This is the last song
And thats okay so
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
I dont want this night to end (right now)
Cos if not tonight then when? (right now)
If the songs about to end (right now)
Then put it on again (right now)
I dont want this night to end (right now)
If not tonight then when? (right now)
The songs about to end (right now)
Then put it on again (right now)
Go
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
We can listen as the world goes crazy
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down
Every hour to end today
This is the last song
And thats okay so
Let me spin a little record for you baby
Pump it up
Make it loud
Bring the house down, (and let me spin)
Let me spin a little
Let me spin a little 
Pump it up
Make it loud, (and let me spin)
Bring the house down
