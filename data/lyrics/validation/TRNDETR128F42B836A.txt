City roof top, summer night
In your tank top rainbow styling
Last night girl, like a dream
Never felt so good, sleepy smiling

All this love saved up for nothing
I've never felt so blue
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
And this will do me no good
And all this love, rainbow styling

Everyday that summer, by your side
And it all just seemed everlasting
But then you told me you would move away
And you looked so cute there, there u were crying

All this love saved up for nothing
I've never felt so blue
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
And this will do me no good
And all this love, rainbow styling
(repeat)
