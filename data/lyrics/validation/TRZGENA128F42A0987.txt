Well, these days it's kinda hard to love someone
Ain't too funny, honey, when it's just begun
To trust somebody and you give it all away

There goes another broken heart
Here comes another rainy day
Yeah...rainy day

Oh, I've seen it way too many times before
A love gone bad can make you wanna hit the floor
Cryin' and beggin', but no matter what you say...
There goes another broken heart
Here comes another rainy day

Give it some time. It's alright. It'll go away
Cuz in due time, you'll find there's another day
I said, another day!

I'm not tryin' to tell you people what to do
I'm singin' you a story 'bout the things that I been through
I know the feeling when love walks away
There goes another broken heart
Here comes another rainy day

Give it some time. It's alright. It'll go away
Cuz in due time, you'll find there's another day
I said, another day

Broken hearts, they mend. Rainy days, they end
Well just keep tryin'. Don't give up
Here comes a sunny day, a brighter and better way
Live and love

Oh, here comes a sunny day
A brighter and better way
To live and love, and live and love, and live and love, and live and love

Oh yeah

There goes another broken heart
Here comes another rainy day
