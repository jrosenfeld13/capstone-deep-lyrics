So you've loved me now
For half a year
Despite the distance and the fear
Of a falling sky and a gathering storm
That'll blow me back where I came from

That ain't the way I see you baby
I know you're not that kind of girl
When you die I will come looking for you
I wouldn't miss it for the world

An opportunist waiting for a chance
To fuck you over leave you flat
Take off your dress and go straight to the press
To make time on the evening news

Is that the way you see me baby
I know you're not that kind of girl
When you die I will come looking for you
I wouldn't miss it for the world

That murderer who shares your cell
Well his sentence don't have to be yours as well
Cause when you sleep you count the stars
He's making enemies across the bars

That ain't the way I see you baby
I know you're not that kind of girl
When you die I will come looking for you
I wouldn't miss it for the world
