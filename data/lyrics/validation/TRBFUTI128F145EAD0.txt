(Intro)
No I'll never ever let it
No I'll never ever let it go
No I'll never ever let it
No I'll never ever let it
Never let it go
Never let it go
Never let it go!

(Chorus)
Caressing the downfall
Outstretched arms
On your knees, crawl
(Never let it go)
Filthy and feeling low
Dancing in the undertow
(Never let it go)

Caressing the downfall
Outstretched arms
On your knees, crawl
(Never let it go!)
The cut that always bleeds, but never shows

(Verse 1)
Everyone crawls to someone
Some run to the puppeteer and volunteer to become one
But who pulls the strings that you are attached to?
Who pours the gas that you are the match to?

Strive for perfection and strike with precision
Soon it blows up in your face and the smoke blurs your vision
But now you're fading fast, maybe your time has passed
Bound and gagged, as you're dragged to be typecast

(Chorus)
(Never let it go!)
Caressing the downfall
Outstretched arms
On your knees, crawl
(Never let it go!)
The cut that always bleeds, but never shows

(Verse 2)
Everyone crawls to someone
Some run to the puppeteer and volunteer to become one
But who pulls the strings that you are attached to?
Who pours the gas that you are the match to?

Strive for perfection and strike with precision
Soon it blows up in your face and the smoke blurs your vision
But now you're fading fast, maybe your time has passed
Bound and gagged, as you're dragged to be typecast

Let it go

Fuck no!

(Bridge)
Jumping back and forth, and forth and back, once more
Oblivious to what it is I'm looking for!
Jumping back and forth, and forth and back, once more
Oblivious to what it is I'm looking for!
Jumping back and forth, and forth and back, once more
Oblivious to what it is I'm looking for!
Jumping back and forth, and forth and back, once more
Oblivious to what it is I'm looking for!

Never let it go!
Never let it go!

(Outro)
Never let it go
Caressing the downfall
Outstretched arms
On your knees, crawl
Never let it go
Filthy and feeling low
Dancing in the undertow
Never let it go
Goodbye, but I cannot forget it
No, I'll never ever let it go
Never let it go
Never, ever, ever, never
I'll never let it
Go! I'll never let it
I'll never let it
Go! I'll never let it
I'll never let it
