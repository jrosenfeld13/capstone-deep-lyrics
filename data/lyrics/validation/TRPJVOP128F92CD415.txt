And I was liftin' through a sea of ice
Maybe chewing gum
Feelin' softer than the velvet sky
And longer than the sun
People movin' on a cloudy train
'round the milky moon
A dog remembers some sweet summer day
On the trail of you

Could you slow down baby? Could you slow down, baby? Come and find me in the dark
If the stars come rollin' and the sky starts foldin' could you tell me who you are?
It's a dream now, baby, what a scene now, baby, oh I don't know where to start
Do you know me, baby, do you know me, baby, did you learn me from the dark?

Who do you know now, lady?
Who do you know now?

There's a big sun comin'
We gotta go now

Did you speak to the midnight?
What do you know now?
Did you see him crackin'
I gotta know now
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, we gotta go right now
