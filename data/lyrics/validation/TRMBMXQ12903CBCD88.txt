Teen Angel
Teen Angel
Teen Angel

VERSE 1
That fateful night the car was stalled
Upon the railroad track
I pulled you out and we were safe
But you went running back

CHORUS
Teen angel
Can you hear me?
Teen angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

VERSE 2
What was it you were looking for
That took your life that night
They said they found my high school ring
Clutched in your fingers tight

CHORUS

VERSE 3
Just sweet sixteen, and now you're gone
They've taken you away
I'll never kiss your lips again
They buried you today

CHORUS

Teen angel
Teen angel
Answer me please
