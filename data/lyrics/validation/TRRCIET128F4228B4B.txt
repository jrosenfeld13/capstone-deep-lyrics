Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this dj vu?
Try the river boat the carousel feed the pigeons Bar-B-Q
Look at all the people happy faces all around
Smiling throwing kisses busy making lazy sounds
It's a bright June afternoon it never gets dark
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Get your green green tambourine let's play in the park
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Some folks are on blankets slowly daydreaming
And reaching for their food
Let's go buy an icecream and a magazine with an attitude
And put on the cassette we can pretend that you're a star
Cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la
It's a bright June afternoon it never gets dark
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Get your green green tambourine let's play in the park
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
There's a painter painting his masterpiece
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon
All my life I've longed for this afternoon
It's a bright June afternoon it never gets dark
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Get your green green tambourine let's play in the park
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
