Transamazonia
Transamazonia keep searching seeking you got to find the reason
Something sacred to believe in

Not one cry, not one voice, not one sound only the River
Insect shrill, waves of noise, phosphor flash, neon cerulean

The Othergreen world, realm of emerald like
The vine of the Soul must be immortal

Long may the Serpant reign manyana and today
Forever green may this domain remain eternal

Transamazonia
Flow motion travel you got to find the answer
Dream warrior sun dancer
Transamazonia keep searching seeking you got to find the reason
Something sacred to believe in

Asilut bound an imaginable ground
To be found beyond the restriction of time
Like the grace of the golden eagles flight to a
Hight journey on with a vision in sight
Onward upward growing like the tree of life
To connect to the infinite light
Soaring the wind to a pinnacle high
Shaman can fly

Shaman can fly

Transamazonia
Flow motion travel you got to find the answer
Dream warrior sun dancer
Transamazonia keep searching seeking you got to find the reason
Something sacred to believe in
Transamazonia Eagle flew out of the night
And split the sky
Why?
Now I realise the Ayahuascquero was right

Shaman can fly

Web of stars, tingent orbs, spectral tones lumen eternae
Amazoan forest clime, kingdom come
All in the fullness of time
