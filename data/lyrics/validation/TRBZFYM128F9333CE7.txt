Wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
Way it felt to hearing lies
People that made you cry

Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
Deal with things I've left unsaid

Want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
Get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye

I've been here before, one day, a week
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie, I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning 'cause

I still don't have a reason and you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you and I
So this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye

So this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye
