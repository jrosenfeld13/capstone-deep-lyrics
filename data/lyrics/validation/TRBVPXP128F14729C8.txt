There are too many things to say
Now that we don't talk to another, to another

I don't miss the way you pulled me down
I couldn't get up, and I couldn't get out
I couldn't shake you, so I started to shout

I'm so done with you, I can't even feel my fingers
I would rather die than live through this hell again
But I'd rather me than you

Two fuzzy Februarys have passed
But you're still as clear as May or June or July, and I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die without love on my side
And I don't wanna die without love on my side

I'm so done with you, I can't even feel my fingers
I would rather die than live through this hell again

Who needs the temptation, if we fall, congratulations
I'm in need of a vacation in the sun
My nails grew short over the summer
But I took it out in writing songs no one could understand

And I don't wanna die without love on my side
I don't wanna die

I'm so done with you, I'm so done with you, I'm so done with you
