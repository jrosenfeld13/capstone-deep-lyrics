What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love, what is love
Well I've been haunted by the invisible ties that bind
And its impossible to get you out of my mind
So I'll be talking and texting till what seems like the end of time
And you know I'll be thinking of you and asking myself
What is love, what is love
Yesterday I knew what it ws
What is love
Today Im not so sure
What is love, what is love
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love
Why try? Why even bother to redefine?
All these feelings that have been floating the water line
Im still happy to know what it was like and I'll be thinking of you and asking myself everytime..
If you go wild I'll take my chances
I'll build a shrine to what romance is

I'll wreck my brain for some kind of answers cause even though Im in vain
What is love what is love?
Yesterday I knew what is was
What is love
Today Im so sure
What is love what is love
Maybe tomorrow I'll know
What is was
What is love what is love
What is love what is love
Yesterday i knew
Wat is was what is love
Today Im not so sure
What is love
What is love
