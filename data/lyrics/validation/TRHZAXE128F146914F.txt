[Verse 1]
She tears the hole up even wider
Lets all the darkness up inside her
Holy old, yeah, you're mine
Your everything is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Without, without a doubt
Without, without a doubt
Hey, where the fuck were you when my lights went

[Chorus]
Went out
Yeah, you don't want to look at it
Went out
Yeah, you don't want to look at it

[Pre-Chorus]
Without, without a doubt
Come on and let me out
Hey, where the fuck were you when my lights went

[Chorus]
Went out
Yeah, you don't want to look at it
Went out
Yeah, you don't want to look at me

[Outro]
Come on and let me out
Come on and let me out
Yeah, tie a soul to you when your life goes down
Time flies when you're falling down
I spread my rot all over this town
And every one of you looks the same
And every one of you feels the same
