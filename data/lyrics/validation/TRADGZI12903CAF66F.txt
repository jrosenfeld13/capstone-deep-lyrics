[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I never been no dummy
But I'll be vulnerable with love
I trusted only
Cause it never failed me no
Now give me free
Cause I'm rich with my supply
And I'm surely a woman
Standing right before your eyes

[Chorus]
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my heart
I wanna give you this love
Help you make a brand new start baby

[Verse 2]
I'm clever when I'm funny
So I wanna make this moment memorable and unique
They can't take you from me
You're in my blood, flowing from my head down to my feet
I'm offering it my all
Cause you've shown that you deserve
Your presence is giving me life, baby
To leave me, to leave me more than want

[Chorus]
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my heart
I wanna give you this love
Make a brand new start me and you babe
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my heart
I wanna give you this love
I wanna make a brand new start me and you

[Bridge]
Me and you girl
Me and you babe
Me and you babe
A brand new start
