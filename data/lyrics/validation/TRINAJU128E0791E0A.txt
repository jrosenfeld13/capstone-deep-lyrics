If I told you once
I'll tell you again
I've had it with your dirty fucking mind
I messed about in the night and found some shelter
Walked a line till you find and inject it in your hand
Told the truth,dry vermouth and the crap your inhaling
I'm gonna die in your mind and find a dirty fucking place to lay, yeah

CHORUS
I'm gonna die in your dirty mind
Norma Jean did you find your way
Tell me love do you remember
I'm gonna die in your dirty fucking mind
Well someone came and took your love away, yeah
Alright.. yeah

Take your time all is lost and what's there to handle
I wasn't gone you were down now the wrench is in your hand
Falling down,in the park the knife in your backside
Gonna die in your mind and find a dirty fucking place to lay, yeah

Yeah
I'm gonna die in your dirty mind
Norma Jean did you find your way
Tell me love do you remember
I'm gonna die in your dirty fucking mind
Well someone came took your love away, yeah
Alright

I saw your old lady in a porno mag
In a porno mag...yeah..

SOLO

Morning Glory spent my pay
I'm still not wasted
And I don't have one bit of faith, yeah
It happened a long time ago
The birth of my will..
I celebrate your life today!

Yeah
I'm gonna die in your dirty mind
