[Verse 1]
Come on, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if Id only waited
Id not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
Ive got to get out of this hole

[Hook]
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Its no cause for concern

[Verse 2]
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know Im dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

[Hook]
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Its no cause for concern

[Verse 3]
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And Im on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it wont change a thing
Im sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to a noose
She came along and she cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
