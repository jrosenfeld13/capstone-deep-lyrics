She tried as hard as she could
But he knew it wasn't good enough and wouldn't ever be
So she had to start hiding how she felt but she loved him
He knew that if his hands weren't tied he would really liked to help her

Don't Touch
Best of Luck

He's still shaking it off
Buys flowers for his wife
Guilty he could even think of life without her
Gets home lookin' like he's seen a ghost
She's ready for the worst but when he tells her
She breaks down crying: I'm so sorry

Don't Touch
Don't Look
Don't Think

We didn't want our love to end in high school
In college I called everyday until the day I met you
A year ago we got in touch, I asked him to forgive me
It should've ended there but I forgot I wasn't eighteen

Don't Touch
Best of Luck

She'll try as hard as she can
But he'll know it isn't good enough and won't ever be
So she'll have to start hiding how she feels the way she loves him
And he knows it still
His hands are tied even if he wants to help her

Don't Touch
Don't Look
Don't Think
Best of Luck

Don't Touch
