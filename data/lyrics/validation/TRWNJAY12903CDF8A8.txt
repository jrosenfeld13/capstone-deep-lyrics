Let's feed up!
It's your grievance, glittering like gold, barking to each other like dogs
C'mon show me your growl!
This battle called love
It's just a trick for your gall
And I don't mind if your grip is tight
Your rage is my new birth...
Show me your razor
So show me your razor

We're dancing on a sheet of glass, we're staring at each other like snakes before the bite, my tongue is your gold and your body is my cage made of pleasure and decay, your body is my cage made of pleasure and decay

So you wanna show me your best intentions
Just get out of my sight
Your revenge is a grievance
It's just another slash on my arms
And I don't mind if your grip is tight
Your rage is my new birth
Show me your razor
So show me your razor

And they gonna find our bodies on a floor
A razor in your hand and your hand into my blood
Narcissus is repeating the same old mistakes
Narcissus is repeating the same old mistakes
Feeling better now?
Do you like cage made of ..., pleasure and decay
Narcissus is repeating the same old mistakes.Narcissus is repeating the same old mistakes

We're dancing on a sheet of glass, we're staring at each other like snakes before the bite, my tongue is your gold and your body is my cage made of pleasure and decay, your body is my cage made of pleasure and decay

So you wanna show me your best intentions
Just get out of my sight
Your revenge is a grievance
It's just another slash on my arms
And I don't mind if your grip is tight
Your rage is my new birth
Show me your razor
So show me your razor

Let's feed up!
It's your grievance, glittering like gold, barking to each other like dogs
C'mon show me your growl!
This battle called love
It's just a trick for your gall
Your rage is my new birth

And they gonna find our bodies on a floor
A razor in your hand and your hand into my blood
