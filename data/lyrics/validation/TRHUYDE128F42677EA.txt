(Jason Blume/Karen Taylor-Good)

If you've ever wondered
When you pray at night
If it makes a difference
If it sets things right
Everytime we say our prayers
Whispered in the dark
Somewhere deep inside you
You know with all your heart
As sure as God's in Heaven
There's someone who cares
And somebody's listening
When you say your prayers
A prayer can be a thank-you
A prayer can be a wish
A prayer can say I'm sorry
Like a hug or a kiss
It doesn't have to be just right
God hears you loud and clear
As long as it comes from your heart
It goes right to his ear
As sure as God's in Heaven
There's someone who cares
And somebody's listening
When you say your prayers
As sure as God's in Heaven
There's someone who cares
And somebody's listening
When you say your prayers
Just know somebody's listening
When you say your prayers
