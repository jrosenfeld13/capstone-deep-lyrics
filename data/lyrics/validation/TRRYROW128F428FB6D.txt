We tried to make this little house
Into a happy home
But we could not succeed
Now it's getting time
To try to make it on my own
Before there's little mouths to feed

Wish me well and hold me
Wish me well and let me go
The dreams that we had
Are over it seems
Wish me well

Time and time we said
We're gonna try to start again
But we could not and we do not
Baby what you say is it's time to say Amen
We gave it all we got

Wish me well and hold me
Wish me well and let me go
The dreams that we had
Are over it seems
Wish me well

Yeah, there were days
We got it right
How more and more
The pretty days looked like the nights
And it's no good
Coming home
Never sure
Just where you're coming from

Wish me well and hold me
Wish me well and let me go
The dreams that we had
Are over it seems
Wish me well
