Stuck a pin in your backbone
Spoke it down from there
All I ever wanted was to be your spine
Lost your friction and you slid for a mile
Overdone, overdrive, overlive, override

You're not the one who let me down
But thanks for offering
It's not a voice and I'm not around
But thanks for picking it

Up, on the radio
Sampled your rust from a faucet, I know
I got a magnet in my head, a magnet in my head
Extra thick, extra long, the way it was wasted

And there's a chance that things will get weird
Yeah, that's a possibility
Although I didn't do anything
No, I didn't do anything

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be your spine
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be your spine

In a mouth kept shut and a tongue twist tie
You're the web in front, you're the favorite lie
You're a buck in my lip, you're a lash in my eye
You're the web in front of a favorite lie

Stuck a pin in your backbone
Spoke it down from there
All I ever wanted was to be your spine
I've got a magnet in my head, a magnet in my head
Extra thick, extra long, the way it was wasted
Wasted
