As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
(Ooo-wee-ooo)
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love (we're so in love)
So much in love (we're so in love)

As we stroll by the sea together
(Ooo-woo-ooo)
Under stars twinkling high above
(Ooo-wee-ooo)
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love (we're so in love)
So much in love (we're so in love)
So in love (we're so in love)
So much in love (we're so in love)

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you, oh, so much
I love, love you my darling
Can't you tell it in my touch?

As we walk down the aisle together
(Ooo-woo-ooo)
We will vow to be together till we die
(Ooo-wee-ooo)
So in love are we two
We can't wait to say, "I do."
So in love (we're so in love)
So much in love (just you and I)
So in love (we're so in love)
So much in love (just you and I)
