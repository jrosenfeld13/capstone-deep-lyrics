I woke upon the floor
Did I deserve this?
I'm not quite sure

You need to take a step back, step back now
I feel it's time to start running
One day you'll look back, look back now
They say hindsights 20/20

I'm not the one that left you here
I'm not the one that you should fear
I'm not the one that you should break
I'm not the one that made you mistakes

You put the blame on everyone else, everybody but yourself
Stop and take a look at your life, cause I want you out of mine

Try this
Trust in Potent
Can you feel this?

I'm not the one that left you here
I'm not the one that you should fear
I'm not the one that you should break
I'm not the one that made you mistakes

You put the blame on everyone else, everybody but yourself
Stop and take a look at your life, cause I want you out of mine

I Will have my revenge
Red rum red rum red
Red Red Red

I Will have my revenge
I WIll have my revenge
Red rum red rum red
