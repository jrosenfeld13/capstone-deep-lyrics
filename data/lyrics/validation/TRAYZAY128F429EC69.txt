Blue stones are cast again
Feeling like I'm one of them too
Pelican road is closed in summer
Feel like I wasted my day

How will I know?
How will I know?

Wheat fields are turning gold
Lunches I eat were always cold
Peanut nut rolls mysteriously
I think my uncle saw me do it

How will I know?
How will I know?
