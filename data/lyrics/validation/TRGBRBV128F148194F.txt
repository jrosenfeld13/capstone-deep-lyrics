You gotta give me some
Give me some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some of your lovin'

Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
(Just give me some)
Some of your lovin' now, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby when I need you
Don't you tell me no

You gotta give me some
(Give me some of your lovin')
Oh yes you do now
You gotta give me some of your lovin'

Now I'm not a jealous child
My demands are mild
(Just give me some)
Some of your lovin' now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know a man likes to feel that he's been around
Before he decides to settle down
I've no doubt
Some day you're gonna feel that way too
But baby, just remember
(Until you do)

You gotta give me some
(Give me some of your lovin')
Oh yes you do now
I mean to tell you
(You gotta give me some)
Of your lovin'

Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
(Just give me some)
Some of your lovin' now, oh oh, oh, oh

You gotta give me some, some of your lovin'
I mean to tell you
(You gotta give me some of your lovin')
Oh, don't forget about me now
I mean to tell you, oh
Ah, you gotta give me some of your lovin'
Some of your lovin'
