You have not seen
The last of me
I'm breeding thorns
I'll follow your
Footsteps down below
I will trust all my
Instincts and bring it home

Does it appeal to you now
As a part of the violation?
That wherever it takes you
You won't be able to choose

I will carry the message
It will swallow you whole

You ain't never
Gonna tell again
Caught as the founder
Of the emptiness
It must have
Made you stocked
Whenever my pride was
Taken, again and again

Again and again

Now put your envy in motion
One step at a time
I wanna see the closure
When your access is denied

I will bury the damage
I will drench the device

You ain't never
Gonna tell again
Caught as the founder
Of the emptiness
It must have
Made you stocked
Whenever my pride was
Taken, again and again

Now I want you to tell me
(Tell me again)
Do you see what I see?
'Cause it's so damn
Obvious to me

(Whenever a promise taken)
Won't you tell me
That it's raw?

You ain't never
Gonna tell again
Caught as the founder
Of the emptiness
It must have
Made you stocked
Whenever my pride was
Taken, again and again

You ain't never
Gonna tell again
