Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find?

An open mind, an attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate

Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find?

Stories you cannot explain
Unfold quite easily
If you see the other side

An open mind, an attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind

Are there other ways to be?
Other lives to live?
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars or above the grass

A new image in your grasp
Focus getting clearer
Seize the moment, take it in

Count on this, you just found out
Three sides to every story
None more right, not one will win
Not one will ever win

An open mind, an attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind

Are there other was to be?
Other lives to live?
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars or above the grass

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind

Are there other was to be?
Other lives to live?
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars or above the grass
