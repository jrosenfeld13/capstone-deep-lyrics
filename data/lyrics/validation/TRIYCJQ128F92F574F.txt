He called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I awoke and he was gone
There's no more baby, baby all night long

He called me baby, oh baby all night long
Kissed my tears away, ?????
What I'd give for you to just come on back home
Call me baby, baby all night long

He called me baby, oh baby all night long yes he did
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each night and dreams just like a song
I hear my baby, baby all night long

Ohhh hear my baby, oh baby all night long
He held me up so high and made me strong
Ohhh baby, ohh baby, come on back home
Never never never, never never will I be alone

Ohhhhh baby, ohhh baby all night long
He held me up so high and I wanna tell ya made me strong
I can still hear my baby call me baby
