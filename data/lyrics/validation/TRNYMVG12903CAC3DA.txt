How sweet it is
How sweet it is
To be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and baby there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And baby there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop, and thank you darling
I said just stop, and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you, babe
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night and I wonder
Where would I be without you in my life?
Everything I did was just a bore
Seen all the things I've done and done before
I say well, you
You know, you brightened all of my days
With a loving so sweet in so many different ways
I want to stop, and thank you darling
I said just stop, and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you, child
Oh, it's so sweet being loved by just you, darling

You're better to me than I've been to myself
You know, that I just can't love just nobody else
I want to stop, and thank you darling
I said just stop, and thank you baby

Ah yeah, how sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, you know it's been so nice I just said it so sweet just being loved by you, darling
Oh, how sweet it is to be loved by you...
