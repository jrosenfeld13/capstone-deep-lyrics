I'm thinkin' of jumpin' off a bridge
'Cause life has gotten down
Can't think of one reason to live
I guess I'll probably drown
I might as well jump, jump, jump
Think I'm gonna jump, jump, jump

The girls nowadays they all boss me around
You know I get less than their dogs
Pointless, and meaningless my friend
You know we're all lost
In the fog
We might as well jump, jump, jump
The water's cold
I think I'm gonna jump, jump, jump
The water's cold
Everybody jump, jump, jump
I'll freeze
My very soul

I wonder is anybody here
Or is this my private dream
I'm gonna pitch myself to sea
'Cause it's such a scary, scary, scary dream
I might as well jump, jump, jump
The water's cold
I think I'm gonna jump, jump, jump
The water's cold
Everybody jump, jump, jump
Ill freeze
My very soul
