Feels like it's all with you
Know I'm in love with you
Say it is nothing
Or maybe its real

Save it until you're down
Love is all through ancient modern people
Everybody hit the ground
Love is all through ancient modern people

Give it all until it's gone
Love is all through ancient modern people
Someone else hurt you who's wrong
Love is all through ancient modern people
Feels like your hanging a cross on the wall
If that's not your picture
That's nothing at all

Love is all through your hair
Love is all through ancient modern people
Everybody sit and stare
Love is all through ancient modern people
Give it all until it's gone
Love is all through ancient modern people
Someone else hurt you who's wrong
Love is all through ancient modern people

You say you're talking to me
I think you never knew
I love it when you hurt me
