Bruno, you know what? Unnamed "as yet"
Made good threat... with a maraschino

In umbra none other than brute creation
Bad with words, but good at rearranging faces

At Bedford-Stuyvesant in loose silhouette
Drumming up violence with a shady "yoo-hoo"

Dang, thereby my shebang
Is an emblem of a bigger bodily crime
Blood feather stuck in mine

My indentation, my griming relief
My body's striped to a degree for good

Mantis without a prayer - a preyer of her own
Iffy to say if unspoken promises hold true

Dang, thereby my shebang is an emblem of a bigger bodily crime
Blood feather stuck in mine

Semi-permanent ultramarine
Scratching the surface from inbetween "I love yous"

Dang, thereby my shebang
Is an emblem of a bigger bodily crime
Dang, thereby my shebang is an emblem of a bigger body of crime
Blood feather stuck in mine
