Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him, I'm sicere
And that there's nothing too good for us

Free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that nothing is too good for us

But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

Teasing hands on his mind
Gives our nights such mystery
Happiness all the time
Oh and how that man pleases me

But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

(bass solo)

Feeling you close to me
Makes all my senses smile
Let's not waste ecstasy
'cause I'll be only here for a while

I've gotta be free, free, free, ooh
And I've just got to be me, me, me
Free, free
My devotion for love
I said ... got to be free

(sax solo)

Free, free
