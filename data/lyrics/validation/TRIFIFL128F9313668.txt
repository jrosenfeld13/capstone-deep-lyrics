So, when they can't stop, won't stop
Who keep the tank topped?
Who reaps the good sleep, keeps the receipts?
I seem 'em sucking up the last drops
Drop the H2 stretch, H3
Where the party at, Democrat?
Sitting on a muggy summer bench, sipping muddy water
Peeping Newsweek, see what's up with Sergeant Slaughter
Hotter days on the way, turn your A.C. Slater up
Burn, aloe vera green, apple now and later
Yup, pass that (sweet)
Mike Mictlan, where the mask at?
Hand over what?
Hand over yours, run that
Man overboard with the same crap drown
Dehumanize communities like Black Hawk Down
They realize immunities and rape them towns
So we speak our minds so fluently with raw, rap sounds
Alright tykes, a Klondike bar's on the line
We need a blind eye turned, keep 'em simple, refined
Oh, the black gold, Texas tea (hah), you're kidding
There ain't been good oil in Texas for a minute
Thats why we knocked over our own thrones
Then watch it combust end up in free speech zones that shock and awe was on us
Watch me ex-pat Brazilian if 85% of Guantanamo is civilian
Blood pumps vermillion beats dump all over a chump populous
Keeping they focus on Paris Hilton (ick)
Prada dead guilty as any internet thread, big check
Probably got a lot of bad head
All night vision all night missions all right
Christ risen? tight nope, call the prisons
Yikes the middle pickin the simple drivel
The riddles a head ripper splitter
Suburbanites will get the kibble (listen)
The double speak is legit
They on some 'stand up for yourself you worthless piece of shit'
Bet it all lose it all forget it
And saying fuck Bush gave that douche a splash, too much credit
But smoking on Kush makes cats so apathetic
Can't beat em with a bat so we join em and spit the ethics
(or) we beat em with a bat (yeah)
POS steadily wreck it for anybody who raps or naps on facts
Fill the in line six to End Hits
The oval office and the lobby prolly listen to Fugazi singin
This one's ours lets take another
This one's ours lets take another
This one's ours lets take another
Then they dance away clean like Savion Glover
