When I'm walkin' by myself
Along the path that I should follow
I can see one reason why
I'm happy I can face tomorrow
No ones gonna change my mind
I'm gonna let my spirits climb
As high as I can go I feel this way because I know

There's something 'bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
Oh we talk about living life for all it's worth
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you

Suddenly I'm in a place
I've never been and see no danger
All you said was walk with me
And you will never be a stranger
All the world is here for me
I opened up my eyes to see it
That's the way I see it
And its all because of you

Oh there's something 'bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
Oh we talk about livin' life for all its worth
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you

Oh it's heaven on Earth (on Earth)
Sharing my life with you

I am free cause I can see so far beyond the here and now
Knowing heaven waits for me just clears it up for me somehow
Everything I see and hear with everything you touch it's clear
You are with me everywhere you never let me down

Cause there's something bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
Oh it's all about living life for all its worth
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you

Oh there's something 'bout heaven
Oh here in the moment
(sharing my life with you)
