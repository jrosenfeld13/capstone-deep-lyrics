Never mind me 'cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the songs they hum
Don't wanna sing along with nothin' that I said

Let him bring you happiness, happiness
It's hard to come by, I confess
I'm better at this than happiness
If you find it, share it with the rest of us

Never mind the words that came
Out of my mouth when all I could feel was pain
The difference in the two of us
Comes down to the way you rise over things I just put down

Let him bring you happiness, happiness
It's hard to come by, I confess
I'm better at this than happiness
If you find it share it with the rest of us, the rest of us

Never mind me 'cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the curse of war
Proud like a badge that just don't shine no more

Let him bring you happiness, happiness
Hard to come by, I confess
I'm better at this than happiness
If you find it, share it with the rest of us
