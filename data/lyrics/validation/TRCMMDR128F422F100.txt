You say that you don't know me and you couldn't if you tried
And your ignorance amazes me with every single lie
You say one thing and mean it then but then you can't decide
I would like to know

What did I do to earn your disrespect?
An overrated importance of superior intellect
The words I say are not as big but does that mean a thing
I guess that I'll just stop
Trying to impress

(Chorus)
I look at you (and wonder what you're thinking)
And what you say (when I turn my back to you)
Your arrogance (powers your ego)

You say that I don't know you but I've tried and tried and tried
And I don't know what you're thinking when you look into my eyes
Is it positive or is it negative the trend
And it's funny the way you thought of me
When I thought that we were friends
I'm glad it all worked out
The way I knew it would
I'm glad that I can stop
Trying to impress

(Repeat chorus)
