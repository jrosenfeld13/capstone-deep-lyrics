Wake me from this altered state
My futures' looking brighter all the time
I'm stumbling and delirious
Somethings' changed since those teenage days
I'm growing into my own
I'm the talk of the town
Looking strange in a faded world

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to hide
When duplicating the obvious
And its nothing we decide
Like you, like me

Twist my words so they read me wrong
The truth was never good enough for you
Is that the best you can do?
Talk me down, look me in my face
Look at you now, feeling like the clown
Next time you should think it over

Chorus 2x

[bridge]
There's no reason
You twist my words
Cuz youre helpless
Lost in a state of madness
