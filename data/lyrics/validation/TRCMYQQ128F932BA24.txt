I am a sniper
Always hit the mark
Paid assassin
Working after dark
Looking through the night
Using infra-red
My target on you
Aimed at your head

Ten thousand dollars up front
Ten thousand dollars when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And ya know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you
Back for you!

I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you

Don't you know that, killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good

Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good

Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good

You'd better believe it
