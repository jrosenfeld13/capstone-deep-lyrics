(It's rather dull in town, I think I'll take me to Paris, hmm
The mistress wants to open up the castle in Capri, hmm
Me doctor recommends a quiet summer by the sea, hmm, mmm
Wouldn't it be loverly?)

All I want is a room somewhere
Far away from the cold night air
With one enormous chair
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Lots of chocolate for me to eat
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Oh, so lovely sittin'
Abso-bloomin'-lutely still
I would never budge till spring
Crept over me window sill

Someone's head restin' on my knee
Warm and tender as he can be
Who takes good care of me
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?
Loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly
