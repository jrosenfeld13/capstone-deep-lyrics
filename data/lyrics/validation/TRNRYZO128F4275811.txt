You say I seem so grim
Darling, do you forgive me?
And I went out on a limb
'Cause I needed to be

Near the fireflies
Flying high above me
And then I hit the sky
And it fell down on me

You said it wasn't sharp
But I cut my finger
You said it just wouldn't burn
And I scarred my face

You know I bite my nails
My skin, and my fingers
And I've heard that's my liver
My nerves, and my brain

I said I just like to bite
On my fucking fingers
Well, do you have another intelligent answer
For me today?

You said it wasn't sharp
But I cut my finger
You said it just wouldn't burn
And I scarred my face
You said it just wasn't there
When it fell down on me

And I'm just a son of a bitch no matter what you say

I lost my trust in you
You were dangerous and scary
Well, you poisoned me with the fruits
Everyone was intrigued by
And I finally got buried

You said I won't forget
And I don't remember
You said I'm something I'm not
And I fell on my face
You said I wouldn't rot
But worms are crawling on me

And I'm just a son of a bitch no matter what you say
And I'm just a son of a bitch no matter what you say
