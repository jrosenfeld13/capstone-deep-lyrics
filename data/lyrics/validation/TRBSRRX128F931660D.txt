[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf]
I see your dir-ty face, hide, behind your collar
What is done, in vain, truth, is hard to swallow
So you pray, to God, to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I, arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come, alive, I, can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I, must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Now the son's, disgraced, He, who knew his Father
When he cursed, his name, turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke, his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world!
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I, arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come, alive, I, can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I, must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeoaw!
Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela
(Rock!) And Pamela
(Rock!) And Samantha
(Rock!) And Amanda
And Tamara, mnage  moi
I'm in here like, "Bitch, what's up?"
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever, just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I, arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come, alive, I, can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I, must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I, arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come, alive, I, can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I, must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock...
Let it rock...

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

[Outro: Kevin Rudolf]
I wish I could be, as cruel as you
And I wish I could say, the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time
