[Verse 1]
You're not what I need anymore
Forget those games you're playin'
You're not what I need anymore
I can't hear what you're saying

[Pre-Chorus]
If you won't listen to me
How can you tell me how I feel?
All along I told you
That I cannot feel the pain

[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not good enough?
All I've ever wanted was a place
Inside of you

[Verse 2]
Why should I hear what you say any longer?
When you don't even know where I've been
I feel something in me getting stronger
And I won't get kicked around again

[Pre-Chorus]
If you won't listen to me
How can you tell me how I feel?
All along I told you
That I cannot feel the pain

[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not good enough?
All I've ever wanted was a place
Inside of you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you won't listen to me
How can you tell me how I feel?
All along I told you
That I cannot feel the pain

[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not good enough?
All I've ever wanted was a place
Inside of you

[Outro]
You're not what I need anymore
