Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah (Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no (Yeah)
And I just wanna tell you right now that I
I believe, I said I really do believe that

Somethings got a hold on me, yeah yeah
(oh, it must be love)
Oohoh, somethings got a hold on me right now, yeah child
(oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk

[Chorus: Etta James]
I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Heyyyy oh
Oh, it must be love
(you know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
Somethings got a hold on me, yeah yeah
(oh, it must be love)
Oohoh, somethings got a hold on me right now, yeah child
(oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I never felt like this before
Somethings got a hold on me that wont let go
I believe Id die if I only could
I sure feel strange, but it sure feels good

[Chorus: Etta James]
I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Heyyyy hey oh
Oh, it must be love
(you know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Somethings got a hold on me that wont let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Loves sure gonna put a hurting on me

[Chorus: Etta James]
I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Heyyyy yeah
Oh, it must be love
(you know it must be love)

You know he walks like love
(you know he walks like love)
You know he talks like love
(you know he talks like love)
Makes me feel alright
(makes me feel alright)
In the middle of the night
(in the middle of the night)
