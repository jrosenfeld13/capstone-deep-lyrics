[Verse 1]
You spoke the word into the vacant universe
You breathed and life became
You wrote the script into the sky
The story told in black and white
Spelling out the glory of Your name

[Chorus]
Thanks to Your love every i was dotted
Thanks to Your love every t was crossed
All of heaven and all of earth acknowledge
You're the Author of the story of the glory of God

[Verse 2]
Before the earth, before the curse, before the crown of thorns was made
You penned the end before we even went astray
So why are we surprised? The Son of Man that came to die
Knew this day before the world was made
You know our prayers before they're even prayed

[Chorus]
Thanks to Your love every i was dotted
Thanks to Your love every t was crossed
All of heaven and all of earth acknowledge
You're the Author of the story of the glory of God

[Bridge]
The words You speak are poetry
I'll gladly be the melody
Until every ear has finally heard
It's all part of Your perfect plan
From the garden to the fall of man
From the day You rose to the day You'll return

[Chorus]
Thanks to Your love every i was dotted
Thanks to Your love every t was crossed
All of heaven and all of earth acknowledge
You're the Author of the story of the glory of God
