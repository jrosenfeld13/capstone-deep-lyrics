Have you notice
What you started?
Does it matter who you are?
And these necessary movements
They just make you fall apart
And you try so hard

It's a game you play
When you're always second best
I've made the same mistakes
But all this is a message
For the different ones
So take this for yourself this time

You've been watching
With your sore eyes
But all you know is lies
And it kills you every time
You complain about your life
And your wasting time
And your standing still

It's a game you play
When you're always second best
I've made the same mistakes
But all this is a message
For the different ones
So take this for yourself this time
Again you'll find
That hope is standing on your side

I've seen days
I've seen better days
I keep thinking I'm falling apart
I'm the same
I'm still the same
I keep asking myself
If I'm ready to start
With giving till I'm happier

It's a game you play
When you're always second best
I've made the same mistakes
But all this is a message
To the different ones
So take this for yourself this time
Again you'll find
That hope is standing by your side
