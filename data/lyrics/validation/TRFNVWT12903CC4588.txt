It's so cold here and I miss you
And I can't help feeling broken
I treat myself like I'm not fragile
Like there's no care to be taken

And I was up last night just thinking
A hundred reasons to be sorry
Why don't you come and lay beside me
Since there's too much now that's vacant

And all the time that we keep wasting
Like we don't know the joy that's harder to bear
For the ground that we stand on
Won't long be there

I pray that we will never tire
Of the work that lies before us
I feel that I will be the weak one
And that you will have to carry me

I hope there never is a phone call
To say it's too dark to keep trying
I hope there's time left to discover
How to cry at all the beauty

And all the time that we keep wasting
Like we don't know the pain we're called to bear
For the ground that we stand on
Won't long be there

And all the time that we keep wasting
Like we don't know it's why we stop and stare
At the ground that we stand on
'Cause it won't long be there

I guess it's me there in the mirror
But I can't say that I know him
When you tell me that you love me
There's no reason I should doubt you
