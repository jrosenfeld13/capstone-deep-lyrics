Someday you'll find that I'll have to stay
It's hard to say when I'm 39 in the face
Don't let your pardon

Someday you'll find that I'll have to stay
It's hard to say when I'm 39 in the face
Don't let your pardon
Don't let your pardon

Call, call 'cause I do wonder
(If the picture's alright)
It's alright, the fall at your knees
(Give it to me right)
Come, come 'cause I don't want to
You won't mind the fold at your seams

Call, call 'cause I do wonder
(If the picture's alright)
If you mind the fall at your knees
(Give it to me right)
Come, all 'cause I don't want to
You won't mind the fold at your seams
(If the picture's alright)

Mary, kiss your hips
It doesn't mean you're loaded
Mary, kiss your hips, ah ah
Mary, kiss your hips
It doesn't mean you're loaded
Mary, kiss your hips, ah ah

Mary, kiss your hips
It doesn't mean you're loaded
Mary, kiss your hips, ah ah
Mary, kiss your hips
It doesn't mean you're loaded
Mary, kiss your hips, ah ah

Mary, kiss your hips
It doesn't mean you're loaded
Mary, kiss your hips
Ah ah ah ah ah
