I used to be lonely 'til I learned about livin' alone
I found other things to keep my mind on
And I'm gettin to know myself a little bit better
Whoa, I keep pushin' on
I keep pushin' on, yeah

Goin' through all the changes, I made so many mistakes
Oh yes I did
Tryin' to leave behind the heartaches
And sometimes I think I was a little bit crazy, oh yeah
Whoa, I keep pushin' on

(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
Keep pushin' on
(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
You know you have gotcha to be so strong
(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
Well even if you think your strength is gone
(Keep pushin', keep pushin')
Keep pushin' on

Well it's comin' together, I finally feel like a man, oh yes I do
I never thought that I'd be where I am, oh
Every day I wake a little bit higher
Whoa, I keep pushin' on, oh yeah

(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
Keep pushin' on
(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
You know you have gotcha to be so strong
(Keep pushin', keep pushin', keep pushin')
Well even if you think your strength is gone
(Keep pushin', keep pushin')
Keep pushin' on
