Love, should it be so tragic?
Should it be dramatic?
Should it take such a toll on you?

Trust, why is our trust faded?
Jesus says to trade them
Trade our scars for His promises

So give Him all your love this time
And give Him everything you are this time
You've never been so lucky
To have a friend like Jesus

Wait, how long will you wait here?
Your life longs for a new year
Your healing must begin somewhere

Everything you could ever want
Is right before you
He is close to your broken heart
You're right where you should be
