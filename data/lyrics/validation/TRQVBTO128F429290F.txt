[Intro]
Talk about it
Talk about it
It's a shame, yes a crazy crazy
Tell it to 'em

[Verse 1]
Heard you thought about comitting suicide
Was it your pride that made you wanna die
Leave your momma, wonder why
And your baby here to cry
And was it over a jilted lover
Trusted brother, operating undercover
Make you turn your back on your God

[Chorus]
Tell me what you crying for, let it go
He don't want you no more
Sugar, what you dying for (You'll see)
You'll never know
Cuz once your eyes are closed
That's all she wrote
What you crying for
Let it go
She don't want you no more
What you dyin' for stupid
You'll never know
Cuz once yo' eyes are closed
That's all she wrote (Listen see)

[Verse 2]
Hey hey, bro' man, with the masterplan, craving in pain
Doing all you can to win your prima-donna
Sexy brown, coochy down
Thought the love you had was iron clad
But here you caught chillin' at your homeboy's pad
And now you wanna put a bullet in your cap
Are you mad

[Chorus]
Tell me what you crying for, let it go
He don't want you no more
Sugar, what you dying for (You'll see)
You'll never know
Cuz once your eyes are closed (Uh huh)
That's all she wrote
What you crying for, let it go
She don't want you no more
What you dyin' for stupid
You'll never know
Cuz once yo' eyes are closed (yeah)
That's all she wrote

[Bridge]
Messin' with your mental, tearing out your central
Focusing on that kinda stuff that don't amount to anything
I'm pressing you to enter into an agenda
Altered state of mind
That allows you to control your pain

[Chorus]
Tell me what you crying for, let it go
He don't want you no more
Sugar, what you dying for (You'll see)
You'll never know
Cuz once your eyes are closed
That's all she wrote
What you crying for
Let it go
She don't want you no more
What you dyin' for stupid
You'll never know
Cuz once yo' eyes are closed
That's all she wrote (Listen see)

[Bridge]
Messin' with your mental, tearing out your central
Focusing on that kinda stuff that don't amount to anything
I'm pressing you to enter into a agenda
That state of mind
That allows you to control the pain

[Chorus]
Tell me what you crying for, let it go
He don't want you no more
Sugar, what you dying for (You'll see)
You'll never know
Cuz once your eyes are closed
That's all she wrote (You'll see baby)
What you crying for, let it go
She don't want you no more
What you dyin' for stupid
You'll never know
Cuz once yo' eyes are closed
That's all she wrote (Yeah)
