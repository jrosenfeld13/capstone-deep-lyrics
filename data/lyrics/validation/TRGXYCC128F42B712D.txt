I heard she broke your heart again
So now you're going to come and see me

We're back to the start again
Whens she going to set me free

I've been there time and time again
The girls no good for me and you
She hurts me too

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well that girl's a heart breaker

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well that girl's a heart breaker

Well now that girl may have friends in the buisness
And great qualities I have yet to see
But in my eyes shes done us wrong enough times
For your to side with me

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well that girl's a heart breaker

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well that girl's a heart breaker
