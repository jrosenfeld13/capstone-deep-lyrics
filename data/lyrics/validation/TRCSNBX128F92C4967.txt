[Verse 1]
Babe, will you save me a dance by the river
Moonlight is serving us well
She makes the whole world silhouette
Makes it flicker like film on a strip
Dont let the sadness in yet to react as if
Somehow its all come and gone
Lets pretend were all healed up and happy and moved on

[Chorus]
Tonight let the moon come shine
Let us remain you and I
Tell the sun not to rise
For the darkest time
Moonlight keep us steady
Give me one more night then Im ready
To let go, to know we are only shadows

[Verse 2]
Babe, Im so sorry to ask
Im ashamed but tonight I just cant give you up
I shackled myself to the past and my will has gone missing
Lets call our shadow selves out for the evening
And watch them remember our love
Tomorrow will come and I know theyll be leaving
That our time is up

[Chorus]
