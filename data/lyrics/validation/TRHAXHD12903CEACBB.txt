[Verse 1]
Im lauging but youre laughing at me
And I think oh how could this be?
And I wonder if it could be the same
If it could be the same

I look around and I close my eyes
Just for a second and begin to cry
And I wonder if it could be the same
If it could be the same
If it could be the same
If it could be the same
Its not a shame

My songs, they mean things to me
Even if you cant see
And I wonder
If it could be the same
If it could be the same

Suffocating like Brian Jones
They must be more clear
Set me freeeeee
Please set me free
Please set me free
Please set me free
Please set me free

And near the tide
Seems good to me
But things in life, they aint for free
They aint for free
They aint for free

Have an urge deeper than me
To quit school and just be free
And I wonder
If it could be the same
If it could be the same
If it could be the saa a ame
If it could be the same
Its not a shame

I wrote a new song and no one cares
They must be more cleeeaar
Set me freeee
Please set me free
Please set me free
Please set me free
Please set me free
