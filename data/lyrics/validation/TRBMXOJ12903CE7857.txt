I wasn't looking for a lover
I wasn't looking for a friend
I wasn't working undercover
And I wasn't trying to pretend

But when you walked across the dance floor
Just like the moon across the sky
I knew that I would have to see more
I knew that I would have to try
I look into your eyes and I realize

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know I'll start to feel it all again
Won't someone save me

Then she jumped aboard the brown line
And I accidentally caught her eye
She told me she was born a Libra
And I told her I was Gemini

She made suggestive conversation
Then she lightly brushed my hand
Overcome by her temptations
We jumped off down by the strand
And in the English night, oh, I realize it again

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know I'll start to feel it all again
Won't someone save me

She asks me to come inside
We can just talk for a while
I wonder if I should
But her touch, her touch, it feels so good
I look into your eyes and I realize it again

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know I'll start to feel it all again
Won't someone save me

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know I'll start to feel it all again
I must be crazy
