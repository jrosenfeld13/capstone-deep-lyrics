Guilty, angered, of all that's been betrayed
Longing, dreaming, where is yesterday

Day by day we see the world, falling to defeat
Water, air, all are lost, and the food we eat
Needless wars brought about, by the powers hands
Children cry, mothers weep, they can't understand

Calling, begging, do we really hear
Ignoring, denying, from year to year

Burning earth, land of the flame, losing to the force of greed
Burning earth, land of the flame, we forgot her needs

Hour by the hour, we sink into the deep
Money talks, to the guards, stolen in our sleep
Ordinary citizen, ignorance complete
Fooled again, by their ways, often to repeat

Calling, begging, do we really hear
Ignoring, denying, from year to year

Burning earth, land of the flame, losing to the force of greed
Burning earth, land of the flame, we forgot her needs

Save her now, from sea to sea
Time is short, we all believe
Save us all, no amnesty
It's the shame, of humanity
