If you told me something that wasn't true
You do
Stop and have a look just exactly what you
You do

Did I go to fast
Did I go to slow
I know something that you might want to know

When you wait while I answer your call
I know you're the enemy
Just need some time to escape from it all
This could be the enemy

Since you found another new place to hide
I smile
Set apart from all of the things that's inside
Tonight

If I went to fast
Did I go to slow
I know something that you don't want to know

When you wait while I answer you call
I know you're the enemy
Just need some time to escape from if all
This could be the enemy
The enemy

If I went to fast
Did I go to slow
I know something that you don't want to know

When you wait while I answer your call
I know you're the enemy
Just need some time to escape from it all
This could be the enemy
