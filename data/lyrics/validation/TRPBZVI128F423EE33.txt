You take a look around
And dont like what you see
Theres peoples you dont know
But you know they care
Its been so long since you've heard the hurting words
"i care for you" and its right this time
Forget your past and see what is now
Even if you dont want to

You've got to face the truth
You've got to face the truth

You take a look around
And dont like what you see
Theres peoples you dont know
But you know they care
So you wait to say goodbye cause "someday"may come along
Not thinking of reality
You make the most with your lies
A broken heart comes crashing down
And your stabbed from behind
Not willing to admit the truth?
Just face the truth

You've got to face the truth

You take a look around
And dont like what you see
Theres peoples you dont know

Why don't you care?

So you wait to say goodbye cause "someday"may come along
Not thinking of reality
You make the most with your lies
A broken heart comes crashing down
From your stab from behind
Not willing to admit the truth?
Just face the truth

Why don't you care?

So you wait to say goodbye cause "someday"may come along
Not thinking of reality
You make the most of your lies
A broken heart comes crashing down
From your stab from behind
Not willing to admit the truth?
Just face the truth

Why don't you care?
