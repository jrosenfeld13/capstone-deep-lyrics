Down, down, I'm feeling down
But for now I'll stick around
Just to see if it was really me
Or if I'm right in thinking you're wrong

You took me on a pleasure trip
But the waves got high and sunk the ship
And the captain was mad and so was his crew
And they all looked just the same as you

Up you took me high
Earth to the moon and back through the sky
But the wings that I wore didn't fit me too well
I only wanted to fly but I fell

Down, down, I'm feeling low
But sooner or later it's got to go
This restless feeling in my shoe
Will carry me to somebody new

Down, down, I'm feeling low
But sooner or later it's got to go
This restless feeling in my shoe
Will carry me to somebody new
Somebody new

Down, down, I'm feeling low
But sooner or later it's got to go
This restless feeling in my shoe
Will carry me to somebody new
