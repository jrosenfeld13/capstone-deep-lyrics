[Verse 1]
Paula came from Washington with long golden hair
Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear
Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green
Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams
Street life's the only life they take a walk in the park
Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark
Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die

[Hook]
Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

[Verse 2]
Way out on the dock that night the colour is red
23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath
Outside the sister cried she said the whole world's so mean
Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All my love, you're my all
They way you move, you're in control
The way you talk, the way you dress
Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress
All my love, you're the best
Every little thing that I possess
It's all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy
If this going to kill us then let it go
Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Your eyes, your lips, the shape of your mouth
It's a sweet life baby
All my love, you're my all
The way you move, the way you go
I'm all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul
All my love, you're all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy
The way you move, you're in control
Quit dreaming this is real life baby
