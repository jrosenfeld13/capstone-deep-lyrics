[** US Deluxe Edition Bonus Track:]
Here's your letter*
And in each line Ill write your love away
And you know
Say its better
But sometimes what is honest I cant say
And its true
I think its better than before
When I gave you love, you wanted more
Theres the door
This is useless
How can I explain what needs no words
But you know
Now youll lose this
To whats been done youre praying for the words
But its you and I guess its better than before
(I guess its better than before)
When I gave you love you wanted more
(When I gave you love you wanted more)
Theres the door
Cause Im on the floor
Theres your letter
When youre done Im saying it once more
Cause its true
And I guess its better than before
(I guess its better than before)
When I gave you love, you found some more
(When I gave you love, you found some more)
Cause its you
And I guess its better than before
(I guess its better than before)
When I gave you love, you wanted more
(When I gave you love, you wanted more)
Theres the door
Cause Im on the floor
And theres the door
And Im on the floor
