Back from the furious
Slaughter and pain
Trapped in this universe
Completely insane

No more confusion inside his head
Travelled through darkest hell

He's back from the dead
Straight back from hell

His mission is obvious
Evil and plain
Destructive for all of us
For his own gain

No absolution from terror and dread
Nowhere to hide from hell

He's back from the dead
Straight back from hell

Maybe we're strong enough
To fight against this rage
Maybe we're strong enough
To live and tell the tale

He's back from the dead
Straight back from hell
He's back from the dead
Straight back from hell
