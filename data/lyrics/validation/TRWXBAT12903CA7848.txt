Who's gonna dance with me tonight
We're gonna dance till our legs feel kind of tired
But we won't care 'cause we've got the blues
We've got a lot of rocking to do
We're putting on our dancing shoes

We're going skanking all night long
Just as long as they play our song
And this ya sound we can't refuse
We've got a lot of rocking to do
We're putting on our dancing shoes

You'll never love another song like this
It fills your soul
And this ya sound, you can't resist
It's got you in a hold

Never in this world will ever be so much love
As between you and me my love
'Cause we ain't got no time to lose
We've got a lot of loving to do
We're putting on our dancing shoes

Who's gonna dance with me tonight
We're gonna dance till our legs feel kind of tired
But we won't care 'cause we've got the blues
We've got a lot of rocking to do
We're putting on our dancing shoes

We're going skanking all night long
Just as long as they play our song
And this ya sound you can't refuse
We've got a lot of rocking to do
Putting on our dancing shoes

Who's gonna dance with me tonight
We're gonna dance till our legs feel kind of tired
