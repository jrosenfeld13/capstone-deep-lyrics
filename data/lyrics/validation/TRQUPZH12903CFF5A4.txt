When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
It's been so long, so long
I said I'm doing fine
But what haunts my troubled mind
Is where it all went wrong, so wrong

I did not suspect
That we would not connect
And end up strangers

I could dance with you all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because you'll never be my friend
I could walk with you through the rain
We could share each other's pain
We could do all this but it's all in vain
Because you'll never be my friend

As time goes flying by
I have to wonder why
I don't see you anymore
They call it chemistry
What will or will not be
What's missing between you and me

[Chorus]
When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
Maybe so long, so long
If you chance on me some night
Underneath some lone streetlight
Just wave and say, "so long, so long"

I do not regret
The chance I shan't forget
And we're no longer strangers

You could dance with me all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because I'll never be your friend
You could walk with me through the rain
We could share each other's pain
We could do all this but it's all in vain
Because I'll never be your friend

Never be my friend,my friend
You wouldn't be my friend
And I couldn't be your friend
So long,so long...
