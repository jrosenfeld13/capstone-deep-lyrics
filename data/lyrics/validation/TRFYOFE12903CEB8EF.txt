My man understands, he holds me in the palm of his hand and
I like it ,I like it
He's a dream, the real thing ,he always makes me feel like a queen
And I love it, I love it
His arms, are warm, they keep me away from harm and I'm proud of it ,so proud of it
He's mine, he's fine, he makes a funny feeling go up my spine
And I wanna keep it like this all the time

He's got what I want,when I want it ,he's got what I need,when I need it
I'd fight a million, just to keep it,Just to keep on holding to the precious love he gives me

How I hate, to sit and wait ,when I know he's got to work late
I can't stand it, can't stand it
But when, he walks in ,and I'm in his lovin' arms again
I forget it ,I.... forget it
His touch, is too much, he knows how to love me just enough
And I love him, I love him
My man, understands ,he holds me in the palm of his hand
And I wanna keep it like this, all the time

He's got what I want ,when I want it,He got what I need, when I need it, I'd fight a million, just to keep it. Just to keep on holding to the precious love he gives me
My man understands, he holds me in the palm of his hand
And I wanna keep it like this all the time
Yeah I wanna keep it like this all the time
