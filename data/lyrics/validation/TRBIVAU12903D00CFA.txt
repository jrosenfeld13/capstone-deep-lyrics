I was there in the beginning, I will be the last to leave
And I'm moving thru the ages with the comfort of 'God's speed'
There is no such thing as perfect, so I might apologize
That I didn't see the darkness in your eyes

I'm a man with many colours, I'm a man of many names
I'm a rebel and a teacher. I am no one just the same
If I give away the answers, you have questions put on hold
But I didn't see the weakness in your soul...
Love is the only answer  Love's what you feel
In the end you can invest in love but never ask for payback

I've been traveling every roadside. I've been sailing every sea
I've been circling like an orbit around that cosmic Christmas tree
You think science is a fact, but it's just a childish game
Cause they never saw the greatness of the game
In the end you can invest in love but never ask for payback

So craziness begin, on a cold rail straight to hell
There are 10 more rounds to go, we're just waiting for the bell
Not much time for smalltalk now, besides the hammer & the nail
Bring out the monsters from the shadows - 't never fails
-"Where did all the goodness go? - I feel alone"
"Suddenly they're just crawling out like from under a stone"

Love is the only answer  Love is what you feel
In the end you can invest in Love  but never ask for payback - no Jack

Look when you stand on the brink of that dark hole
It's like the world just collapsed in this space
If you look for a trace of redemption  You're not likely to find it in this place

I've always looked for good in everybody. I've seen so many places under the sun
Now  bail me out or let me down. It's just you and me and time
I'm a king who lost his crown. I bid you bread and wine!

I always hoped that love was in your eyes. Now what a sacrifice to find out if I was right
Now bail me out or let me down. It's just you and me and time
I'm a king who lost his crown. I bid you bread and wine!

Where did all the goodness  where did all the Love go?
Where is all the kindness  can love find a home?
First you build me up  then break me donwn
I don't want your money  I just want your time
World is getting older now! World is getting colder now!
Egos getting bigger  It's a playground for the wicked!
No one is really listening - No room for the reasoning!
The cash-mashine just opened up it's jaws & now it's giggling

Look when you stand on the brink of that dark hole
It's like the world just collapsed in this space
If you look for a trace of redemption  You're not likely to find it in this place

I was there in the beginning. I will be the last to leave
You've been told so many times before that the truth will set us free
But still you fabricate your dreams  upon greed and lust and fame
Bring shame upon your name  it's so damn hard to elevate
If I speak to you with clarity and read me back alright
So many words may go like shafts of light  Into the darkest night
There's no way out of here!
