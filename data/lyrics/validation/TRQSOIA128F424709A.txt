Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
Give me the poison kiss
Leave me alone like this
If i could see the world
Through someone else's eyes
I would see all the lies
'till dawn before sunrise
Give me a smile and i cry
Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
Give me the poison kiss
Leave me alone like this
I hide behind a smile
Not asking for more and for more
Don't you know that i never though this could happen before
There comes a time to be free
To be free
Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
Give me the poison kiss
Leave me alone like this
Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
Give me the poison kiss
For a long and last goodbye
Leave me alone like this
So i never will know why
