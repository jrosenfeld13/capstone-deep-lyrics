Some people want to tell me its fine
Spend your whole life waiting in a line
Well go ahead, join the living dead
I've got a different plan for mine

When the sun comes over the sea
I'll tell ya where I'm gonna be
Ridin in the van with the rest of my band
The wheels singing in my dreams

Chorus:
Please fogive me if I can't learn to live in Generic
America
Where the wavy fields got paved
The kids are out looking for a rave
And the rest of us sat on our big fat ass
Watching the rose bowl parade
Oh why can't you see, I can't be me in your Generic
America
Don't want to live vicariously, in a virutal reality
Shopping malls and prison walls all look the same to me

So don't try to tell me its fine
Don't try to tell me I'm wasting my time
Everybody line up, piss in a cup
You got to be out of your mind
Cause I'll do it any way I choose
All over your desginer shoes
Beware of the ruffian who ain't got nothing
He ain't got nothing to loose
