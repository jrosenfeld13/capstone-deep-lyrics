Can't ever really fight it
You get me so high
It's the heat of your lips on my silky skin
I think I'm going under
Can't really fight it
Aay!

You got me so hot and bothered
Your skin is so exiting
There's no way I can resist 'em
Boy your eyes are so inviting
All around the likes and buzzle
Like a tiger sneaking towards me
Hold me close against those muscles
Hard as steal they drive me crazy
My bodys getting so weak
That I feel like I'm dying
Can't seem to fight this attraction
Your touch is driving me crazy
And I'm hoping that you take me
'Cause I know that I can't fight it a-ha
I can't fight it a-ha
I think of nothing but being with you
Trapped like an animal in the zoo

Ay el amor, el amor, el amor

No hay aire, sin aire
I swear that I can't deny it
Mas aire, no hay aire
You see that I cannot hide it
Ay el amor, el amor, el amor
No hay aire, sin aire
I swear that I can't deny it
Mas aire, no hay aire
You see that I cannot hide it
'Cause I'm under your thumb and it's making me numb
So now I'm falling

Enamorada, que rrico papi, enamorada
Ay papi, aqui no hay aire, que rrico
Enamorada
Ay Pa-pi

All through the night time
We could be making love
Our lips pressed so tightly
We're biting
I get so exited

I'll make good love to you
I'll make good love to you
Until the morning light
Under and over
Our bodies are moving
Like the stormy ocean wave

No hay aire, sin aire
I swear that I can't deny it
Mas aire, no hay aire
You see that I cannot hide it
Ay el amor, el amor, el amor
No hay aire, sin aire
I swear that I can't deny it

All through the night time
All through the night time
Aaaahhhh

I'll make good love to you
I'll make good love to you
Until the morning light
Under and over our bodies are moving
Like a stormy ocean wave

I'll make good love to you
I'll make good love to you
Until the morning light
Under and over our bodies are moving
Like a stormy ocean wave

No hay aire, sin aire
I swear that I can't deny it
Mas aire, no hay aire
You see that I cannot hide it
Ay el amor, el amor, el amor

I'll make good love to you
I'll make good love to you
Hay, Hay
All through the night time
I'll make good love to you
I'll make good love to you
All through the night time
All through the night time

No hay aire! Sin aire!
I swear that I can't deny it!

No hay aire, sin aire
