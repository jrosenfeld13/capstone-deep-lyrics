[Verse 1]
Say, my love, I came to you with best intention
You laid down to give to me just what I'm seeking
Say love, you drive me to distraction
Oh my love do you believe that we might last
A thousand years, or more if not for this
Our flesh and blood, it ties you and me right up
Tie me down, ah well

[Chorus]
Celebrate we will
Because life is short but sweet for certain
(Hey)
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change

(Change)
(Why would I want to change it)
(Change)

[Verse 3]
Hey, my love, you came to me like
Wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and, oh, you
Quench my mind

[Chorus]
Celebrate we will
Because life is short but sweet for certain
(Hey)
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we can

[Bridge]
Celebrate, oh, you and me girl
Climb onto my
(Climb onto my)
Two, to be sure
These days continue
Things we cannot change
Change
Change

[Verse 3]
Oh, my love I came to you
With best intention
You laid down to give to me
Just what I'm seeking
Say love, watch me celebrate together
Celebrate we will
Cause life is short
But sweet for certain
We're climbing two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change

(Celebrate together)
Oh ho
(Climbing two by two)
(Climbing two by two)
(Celebrate these days come  two)
Things we cannot change
