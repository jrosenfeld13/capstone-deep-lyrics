Hoy, Mighty Woman
I say don't let them put u down
( no no no no no no)

I got a friend he's a musician
Singing songs of freedom here
Him says he's a rastaman
Against discrimination yo yo yo
Cryin' out fe peace all around the world
Chantin' justice with beautiful words!
Yeah man but his woman stays at home
And looks after the children on
Di woman is alone
Tell me why she's never complaining why?

Mighty Woman, Mighty Woman
So you must be strong to make it today
Don't care no boy, don't care no man
Don't care what they say

Oh mighty woman 
Don't let them put u down
She says : how shall i work it out
I got so much things to worry about
I ain't got no time for myself
No time fe live my life
Cooking cooking cooking everyday
Cleaning cleaning cleaning all the day all the day
Woman goes to get her son at di police station
Woman getting worried
Policeman says a mother should care about her children
Woman getting tired
So many sacrifices, too face tribulations
And don't wait fe any recognition
Woman don't let them make u'r life be a prison
I say don't let them put u down

Mighty Woman, Mighty Woman
So you must be strong to make it today
Don't care no boy, don't care no man
Don't care what they say

Oh me good friend, oh my brother
Ur chanting rastafari
U say we're all living together
Under the protection of the most high
U say we should all live in harmony
But u can't even do it with ur own family
Hey man there is war war in ur kitchen
Ya'd better watch what watch what ur doing
War war in the kitchen
Now u should stop and think a little man!

(Merci  lou pour cettes paroles)
