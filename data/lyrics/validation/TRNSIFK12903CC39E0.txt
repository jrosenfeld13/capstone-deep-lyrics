Well, I was raised on country classics
Like Roy Acuff and George Jones
Lord, I loved to hear 'em
Sing all them old-time country songs
But I really got excited
'Bout the time I turned fifteen
That's the first time I heard Waylon
And old Bocephus sing
They put some drive in their country
That really turned me on

Yeah, put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you movin'
You know that can't be wrong
Every time I hear that outlaw stuff
On my car radio
It makes me wanna drive it
Just as fast as it will go
Put some drive in your country
Let's keep country drivin' on

We played some shows in Atlanta
On Sunday afternoons
The gigs were packed and I was nervous
'Cause I wanted folks to like my tunes
The crowds were full of younger people
They were all about my age
So I turned and told the band
Just before we walked on stage
Put some drive in your country, fellas
We turned those people on, oh, yes we did

Yeah, put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you dancin'
You know that can't be wrong
See, I made myself a promise
When I was just a kid
I'd mix southern rock and country
And that's just what I did
Put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on

Put some drive in your country
Hey, let's keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you movin'
You know that can't be wrong
I still love old country
I ain't tryin' to put it down
Damn, I miss Duane Allman
I wish he was still around
Put some drive in the country
Keep country drivin' on

Yeah, put some drive in the country
Yeah, let's keep country drivin' on, yeah
