I'm all alone of the road
This high water tied underneath the flood
In deserts of dust if I must i will stand
These are my promises

I hope you're winning the war
To make everything like it was before
All that we were we can still be again

I swear

I'm afraid you're gone

I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
I just wanted you
I just wanted you to know

Inside of me forever you'll go

Now I just want to go home
Carried by all that was ever known
Held in these hands if I must I will stand

Given these promises

Now I've been running too long
These feet are too tired to carry on
Weighing us down if you're gone I will drown

I'm afraid you're gone

I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
I just wanted you
I just wanted you to know

If forever exists
Inside me it where you belong
If forever exists

I've got the sun in my eyes
I didn't see you passing me by
Now I've been running too long
To carry on
I don't want you
I don't want you to go
I've got the sun in my eyes
I'm afraid you're gone
If forever exists
Inside me is where you belong

If forever exists...
