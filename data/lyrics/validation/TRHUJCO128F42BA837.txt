Storm warnings on the radiogram
SOS, distress signals from the archipelago to the mainland
Mountains tumblin into the sea
Phone lines open'd up so deep you can hear the devil breathe

You better pray, sister pray
'cause there ain't no better way that is safe, everybody needs savin'
You better stay brother, and don't you stray
From the righteous path you're walkin'
Everybody's talkin' about it

The gospel train is comin'
Now don't you want to go?, yeah
And leave this world of sorrow
The troubles will be gone

Mayday! mayday! captain signals awful dire
Can't call the coast guard, the radar has no wire
Satellite systems comin' down like fallin' stars
Drivers lookin' for the roadmap, yeah, nobody knows where in the world they are

The gospel train is comin
Now don't you want to go?, yeah
And leave this world of sorrow
The troubles will be gone

You better pray... sister pray, 'cause there ain't no better way that is safe, everybody needs savin'
You better stay brother, and don't you stray
From the righteous path you're walkin' (the righteous path you're walkin')

'cause there ain't no better way
'cause there ain't no better way

The gospel train is comin
Now don't you want to go?, yeah
And leave this world of sorrow
The troubles will be gone

Ohh, can't you hear it run?
Don't you want to go?
And leave this world of sorrow
The troubles will be gone

'cause there ain't no better way
'cause there ain't no better way

The gospel train is comin
The gospel train is comin
The gospel train is comin
The gospel train is comin
