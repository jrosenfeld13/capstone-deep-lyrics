[Verse 1]
And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Verse 2]
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything seems like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know your alive

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Bridge]
Oh hey, don't wanna be all alone, no
Yeah, said I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be left here on my own
No one knows me quite the way you know me
And I'd be lonely without you beside me
Please believe me
You're the closest, the closest, baby
To heaven that I'd ever be

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Outro]
Yeah, who I am...
