Summer Months Are Gone
The Snow Is Falling Now My Darling
Im Sitting Here On My Bed
Thinking Of Yesterday
I Remember Everything
The Blankets, The Sand, The Stars
Do You Remember?
Do You Rmember?

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me

Well Now That You Are Gone
My Heart Has Left With You My Darling
Living Isnt Easy Anymore
Baby If You Only Knew
How I Remember Everything
Swimming In The Lake With You
We Should Have Never Separated
I Know We Should Have Stayed Together

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me

(Bridge)

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me

I Dont Care
I Want You To Be Here With Me
When The Days Are Gone
And The Sky Is Grey
And You Look At My Love
I Hope Youll Find Me
