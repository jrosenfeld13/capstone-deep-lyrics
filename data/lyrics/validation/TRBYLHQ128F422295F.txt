Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
The little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

Beneath me Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
By me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with Thee there

Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the heavens looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay...
