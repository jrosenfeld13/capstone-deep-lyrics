Here comes the original businessman
He smiles at you as he shakes your hand
"Listen to me" - he's got a lot to say
But you don't understand
No, you don't understand
So you say "OK"

They'll do it once, they'll do it again
The world is run by businessmen

He takes your money, you take his word
He tells you things you've never heard
He says "Sign here on the dotted line"
But you don't understand, no you don't understand
But you think it's alright

He disappears for a month or two
He ripped you off and you dunno what to do
You'd take him to court but you don't know his name
Cos businessmen, yes businessmen are all the same
