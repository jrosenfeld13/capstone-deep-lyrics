Can't think twice about the way I feel
No one on Earth can stop the wheel
There's an awful sound when you push me down
Pin my shoulders to the ground
You're so insane to close the door on me
When you know everyone is going to see
Things are all strewn about, can't figure out
Wanna tear me apart, make a new start
But you sneak on in to kick me in the shin
