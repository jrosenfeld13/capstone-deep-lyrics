When I look around I only see out at one eye
The smoke surrounds my head, in the sauna
I hear the voices but I can't make out the words

They're saying things, saying things that I
Got something stickin' in my eye
Got something stickin' in my eye
Got something stickin' in my eye

I feel unusual from thinkin'
Better be underground decay, God help me
Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry
Its not from pity

It comes from whats been stickin' in my eye
Got something stickin' in my eye
Got something stickin' in my eye
Got something stickin' in my eye

Got something stickin' in
Got something stickin' in
Got something stickin' in my eye
