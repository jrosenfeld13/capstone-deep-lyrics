And my eyes shut tight as the eyes of dark slip away
And I'll drift through dreams till the dawn of the day
When the sun comes up and I'll be here alone
Time plays the same joke again
Where it drags out forever a longer
Always could last only seconds as shorter
Those sweet hours when you're here by my side

And all these days are never ending
All the time life grew long and bye
I'll sleep long and well tonight
Because in dreams you're in my sight
When eyelids shut I'm not lonely anymore
And everything within the world is right

And a voice on wire is a sad replication if best put
The phone is the only means that I have
To bridge the lonely distance back to you
Hang up and long for your touch
Which I've missed now for weeks since aside
That being apart isn't easier with time
I can only count the seconds until I hold

And all these days are never ending
All the time life grew long and bye
I'll sleep long and well tonight
Because in dreams you're in my sight
When eyelids shut I'm not lonely anymore
And everything within the world is right

I'll sleep long and well tonight
Because in dreams you're in my sight
When eyelids shut I'm not lonely anymore
And everything within the world is right
