Hear me out
Nothing in the world pulls me down inside
Now i know it all seems better
Just a moment
I'd like to stay here for a while
Though it may seem infantile

Don't want to know
What you call devout
I might be sure
You don't say a word
And you'll play your part again
Denial is in your eyes
Don't want to know

What it all is or what it's about
What you say is the truth to who you are
And often i'm left here wondering
If my truth will stretch that far
And i will play my part again
Eyes open wide
Don't want to know
Don't want to know

What it all is or what it's about
Don't want to know
The time or whats to come
And could you play your part again
Eyes open wide
Don't want to know

You live in your fear like paradise
You can't afford to ever let me in
Just happy to be not satisfied
I guess that's the way it goes

And all the love that you will bring
And all the time that it will take and
All the lies you often say
Are the roads just trying to take me
With all my might into desire
Whatever work to make me high
Wou can believe that i'm not trying to find something to save me

And though your heaven will deny
How again i fell the same thing
In the end we will not find one answer
Your living fears confine this day
Brought up and torn in jesus' name
My only hope is nothing stays the same
Your living in fear and living
That's the way it goes
Yeah that's the way it goes
Yeah that's the way it goes
If that's the way it goes
I don't want to know
Bliss, bliss, bliss, bliss
