A box full of visions
In light of my fears
A scene from a movie we saw
Impressions and tears
Try for your heart
I reach for a blur
A postcard we shared in a dream
Somewhere we were
I lack the momentum
But with you Im whole
In search of the better
Real heart real soul

Chorus:
Before we lose forever
Just needed you to know
Before we run for shelter
Let it rise dont let it go
- Love all the pain away
- Love all the pain away
