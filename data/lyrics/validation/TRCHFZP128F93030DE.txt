One chance
One day
It won't come around
I've been waiting
For a sign of life
So many promises
I can't let them go
There's still
So much to say
And i just need to know
If all you had was
One chance
To turn this around
Would you have
The spirit inside
If all you had was
One chance
To take what you need
From life
Would you have
The spirit inside
Lonely memories
They burn in the night
I'll keep you close to me
'til the pain runs dry
If all you had was
One chance
To turn this around
Would you have
The spirit inside
If all you had was
One chance
To take what you need
From life
Would you have
The spirit inside
One chance
To turn this around
Would you have
The spirit inside
If all you had was
One chance
To take what you need
From life
Would you have
The spirit inside
