I start to move
To step outside what's become of you
Remember the time we crossed the line?
Lost our minds for you
I still can't remember why
We felt the need to bring you back to life
After all of the things that
We knew you would do

Everything is still so strange
That it's damaging my brain
All the things that I can see
Are not how they are supposed to be
And I still want to believe
That misery and agony and suffering
Will someday deliver me
Into a world where you belong to me

An extinct disease
Look into my eyes - come unto me
Screaming out the backward names
Of those you would deceive
Your glamorized god is paralyzed
To blackout the miracles I describe
Learning a new way to terrorize
All that we believe
