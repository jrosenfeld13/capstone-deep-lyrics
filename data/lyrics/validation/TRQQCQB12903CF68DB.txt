Who can I believe in
When all my heroes are gone
Does anybody out there know their right from wrong?
No I can't trust the president
I can't trust the cops
I can't believe my ears when the radio's on
I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
Cuz I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way
And I can't expect a teacher
To keep me safe from harm
I can't expect a criminal to say he's wrong
But at the lowest standards
I need a stand up friend
Someone I can look up to; put my faith back in
I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
Cuz I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way
My own way
So I'm turning off the tv
And I smash my radio
Cuz I realize my heroes are the people I already know
And I'm burning up the papers
And tearing up all the magazines
Cuz they make me feel so lonely
When there's no one who represents me
Am I all alone?
Am I all alone?
I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
Cuz I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way
