[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
Well, I guess you will say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (My girl)
Talking about my girl (Talking 'bout my girl)

[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey (Got honey)
The bees envy me (The bees envy me)
I've got a sweeter song, yeah (Sweeter song, yeah!)
Than the birds in the trees (The birds in the trees)
Well, I guess you will say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (My girl)
Talking about my girl (Talking 'bout my girl)

[Bride]
Hey, hey, hey, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I love my baby, she makes me feel proud
I'll climb the highest mountain, and say it out loud
I don't need no money, yeah
Fortune or fame
I've got all the riches, baby
One man can claim (That one man can claim)
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (My girl)
Talking about my girl (Talking 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day!
My Girl...
I even got the month of May
I'm talking about my girl! Oh, yeah!
