Don't you cry for me
Don't give your life for me
All the passion and the pain
Sunshine through the rain
Don't you dance for me
Take some new stance for me
All the fashion and the fame
I heard them calling your name
Fools grow wise in fairytales
Heroes win the day
So raise your voice sing it louder now
I know you got something to say
Now that I know you got something to say
Love, love, love
Now that I know you got something to say
Love, love, love

Take it easy break the mould
Oh yeah be the wonder of it all take it easy on yourself
With regrets come consolations
Oh yeah living from this moment on
Oh yeah living from this moment on
Oh yeah living from this moment on

Don't you cry for me
Don't even give your life for me
All the passion and the pain
Sunshine through the rain
Won't you talk to me?
Come out and walk with me
You know we'll be happy
All o' the world is a stage
Fools grow wise in fairytales
A million miles away
So raise your voice sing it louder now
I know you got something to say
Now that I know you got something to say
Love, love, love
Now that I know you got something to say
Love, love, love
Now that I know you got something to say
Now that I know you got something to say
Now that I know you got something to say
Now that I know you got something to say
