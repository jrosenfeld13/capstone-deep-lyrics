Take me now and I promise forever
My obsession, my darkest fear
I have suffered enough
My dearest, my love

I can't stay here any longer
I have lingered long enough
Waiting for you
My dearest, my love

Again and again I've pleaded
Begged for you to grant my wish
A lifelong dream of you until the end

Alone in life I face this path
I welcome every step towards the dark
A shadow I will no longer cast
Only a faded memory of the past

Come now my love
Finally I feel no pain, no life
Greet me like my dreams
I pray it will last

How I've waited for this moment
I don't ever want to leave
You mend the broken pieces of me

I open my arms to you my daughter
It's been a long time coming
This time we will make it last
This time I will embrace you heart
The last drops of your blood
It shall live in me forever
