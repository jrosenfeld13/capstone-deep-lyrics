(feat. Q-Tip)

Do that, do that, do that, that, that [x2]
You better, do that, do that, do that, that, that
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
Here we come yo, here we come [x3]
It's your boy Kev Mich on the microphone

Yo I love the hood but it gets rough
Growing up there sometimes it gets tough
Especially when mommy is daddy too and she's trying to make a man of you
But why complain, that's not what's up, yeah
Negative turns to positive, if it's wrong do the opposite
What doesn't kill only makes you strong, Hustle hard and keep grindin' on

Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed
And I'm too fresh to be pressed
There's so much going on today but I can't let it worry me
Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed
You better do that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on do that, do that, do that, that, that
You better do that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on do that, do that, do that, that, that

Yes I know that I am older now
But sometimes my problems get me down
My bills are stacked up, credit's jacked up
Rent is racked up and my toilet's backed up
Damn, wish I could flush the drama away

Negative turns to positive, if it's wrong do the opposite
What doesn't kill only makes you strong, Hustle hard and keep grindin' on
Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed
And I'm too fresh to be pressed
There's so much going on today but I can't let it worry me
Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed

[Q-Tip:]
Blessings decent on us, sometimes we neglect
What we think is problematic can sometimes be perfect
Acknowledge our shortcomings and build on our strengths
Emotions can circumvent, down play or just prevent
Fine if she doesn't want to speak to you brah
She can pass on the golden goose that shit's on her
And it's cool if he acts a fool, ___ know it real
As the days go by, he may not cry but loss he will feel
Make it easy on yourself stay thankful and strive
Let go of inhibitions and let go of your pride
As Kev sing the song, we're gonna push it along
Too Blessed to be stressed, no stress in the strong

Wouldn't put you through it, if I didn't do it
And I didn't know firsthand that whatever you want, you can have
Don't waste time complaining, live your life today and
The future's right up in your hands, what you gonna do with it then

You better, do that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on, do that, do that, do that, that, that
You better do, that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on, do that, do that, do that, that, that
Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed
And I'm too fresh to be pressed
There's so much going on today but I can't let it worry me
Cause I'm too Blessed to be stressed

Go on and do that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on, do that, do that, do that, that, that
You better, do that, do that, do that, that, that
Come on, do that, do that, do that, that, that
