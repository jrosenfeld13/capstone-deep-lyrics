There's a bright white light to shine on all the dim bulbs
In the crowd tonight and there's a thin yellow line
To separate the fast lane and there's a man I know
He'll take apart your engine if you ask him right
Let's fire all the publicists and leave LA in flames

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you don't need a passport
To know what state you're in

She wore barrettes of many colours in her many coloured hair
It doesn't matter they don't notice what you wear
It's getting old now there's dissension in the ranks
The fish are growing legs, they're walking out of their tanks

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you don't need a passport
To know what state you're in

You are an ill wind and you blow no good
Santa Ana Winds, a hundred acre wood
Earthquake survivors, swearing youngsters smoking tea
Spit in your hands and you can splinter every tree

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you don't need a passport
To know what state you're in, you're in
