Like an angel she could sing
But she had a broken wing
What a heavy price to pay
This here's the blues for Billie Holliday
Simple gowns all she'd wear
With one gardenia in her hair
I remember her that way
This is the blues for Billie Holliday
Her heart was always on her sleeve
All too soon she had to leave
Like a child she went astray
I sing the blues for Billie Holliday
I just heard her voice again
Like an echo in the wind
Man, there's nothin' left to say
I sing the blues for Billie Holliday
