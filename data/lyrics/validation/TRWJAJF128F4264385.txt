I stand alone as I look at you
Then I become not one, but two
You think you understand my mind
But there's another half inside

Hiding behind what you think is only me
You seem so blind, how will you ever see

It's complicated, not clear to see
My personality's a stranger to me
It's not related, how can this be
My personality's a stranger in me
Stranger in me, in me

We're side by side and the sense is strong
I get the feeling that it won't be long
We seem alone in this mist and glare
But there's a stranger here somewhere

Hiding behind what you think is only me
You seem so blind, how will you ever see

It's complicated, not clear to see
My personality's a stranger to me
It's not related, how can this be
My personality's a stranger in me
Stranger in me, in me
