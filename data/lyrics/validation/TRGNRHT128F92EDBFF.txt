[Verse 1]
Oh, my darling
I have searched the desert and the sky
Just to find you
And take the mourning from my eyes
When I lost you
I suffered and you were sanctified
We are all born to live
We are all bound to die

[Chorus]
Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will fall and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow you'll carry me not
My heart is bound, my soul is chained to the rock
Rock of ages cleft for me
I swung down my hammer out in Joshua Tree
It rang on the mountain and rolled to the sea
And it will ring from the rock

[Verse 2]
Oh, my children
Sorrow shall come to each of us
All our trials
Will soon lay buried in the dust
Long forgotten
But quick as silver turns to rust
Love is found
When the heart is lost

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will fall and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow you'll carry me not
