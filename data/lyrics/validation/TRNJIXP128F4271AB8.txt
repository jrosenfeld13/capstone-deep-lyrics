See their heads up in a cloud, watch them follow what goes on
Through a little screen, oh no, the picture's gone
There is always something else to do
As long as it's no tricky conversation
About the meaning of our lives or
The reason why we pray before we die
I'm afraid I have to say that all of this combined with me
Is very wicked chemistry

It might take a while, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
Take your time, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on

Come on let your wallet be your witness
Put your feelings in a can
Idolize a common man and join the band
You might fall for that but all of this combined with me
Is very wicked chemistry

It might take a while, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
Take your time, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
Take your time, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on

Everywhere, picture you are dancing just like Fred Astaire
Close your eyes and feel the wind blow through your hair
And cool your perfect body and blow away the cross you used to bear

It might take a while, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
Take your time, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
Take your time, turn me on
Live freestyle, come on
