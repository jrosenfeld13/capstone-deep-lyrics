When you'll hear what I'm gonna say
I'm sure you won't be able to turn your head away
'cause what I'm gonna talk about
Nobody wants to be without

And it makes no difference
Who you are
Or what colour you happen to be
As long as you're alive and breathing
This is got to be
One of your needs

I'm talking about freedom
For you and me

When you see how free the birds
Fly in the sky
I'm sure you'll have to say
'My, oh my'
And all the waters in the rivers so deep
Oh, how it flows so free

And it makes no difference
Who you are
Or what colour you happen to be
As long as you're alive and breathing
This is got to be
One of your needs

And it makes no difference
Who you are
Or what colour you happen to be
As long as you're alive and breathing
This is got to be
One of your needs
I'm talking about freedom
For you and me

Everything
Everything that breaths

Everything
Every little thing that breaths

Everything
Everything
Every little thing that breaths
