[Pre-Hook]
One of these days, days, the jig is up
Shouldnt we take the time now to show our love
One of these days, days the jig is up
Shouldnt we take the time now to show our love

[Verse 1]
Yeah I got the blues again
Momma say, "Tell me, did you see the end coming?"
Now Im searching for a sign
But looking back therere only good times
Now Im on the road again
My soul aches
[?] match wont work for me
And now the things dont seem so high
I know I gave him all the love I got

[Hook]
Bye bye roses
I got me a man that's bittersweet
But I don't care
I've known the garden
And I don't care
I've known the garden
Bye bye roses
I got me a hand that's bittersweet
With no regrets
I've known the garden
No regrets
I've known the garden

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 2]
She was always my best friend
Never late
Coffee ice cream made her smile
Now shes left and gone away
And Im here by myself another day
And though I miss her to no end
My heart breaks
Tell me did she did the end coming
At least I know it [?]
All the time she spent with me

[Hook]
