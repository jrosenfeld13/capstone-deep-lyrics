[Intro]
Hey what's happenin' baby
What's your name girl?
Tequila?
Oh yeah, my friends call you Cuervo
You alright with me baby... fo' real

[Chorus]
Now let me tell you about this girl Tequila
She was born in eighteen hundred
She makes me feel real woozy
Sometimes sick to my stomach (ohhh)
But I love this girl Tequila
One shot of her love, it's over
She takes all my money
And all I want to do is hold her....Tequila
My Mexican lover

[Verse 1]
I cannot forget her, my Mexican lover
With that and its strong, can mix her up with no other
Her name Tequila, we met in October
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa
One hit and it's over, the girl's addictive
We stay at the bar cuz she ain't that expensive
Don't give me no problems when I'm with her
Nice brown tone, she got me slither
My girl tequila, a jump me you say so
I'll serve you what ever you pay for
Her nickname Quevo, eighteen honda
She got you woozy, got you sick to the stomach
The girl's a club hoe, a two shine dub hoe
Not far from a drug hoe, get your back by the PO-PO
You're fuckin' with quevo, the girls a killer
I'll have you at the bar takin' shots of Tequila
My Mexican lover..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
See I'm so true pursuing, straight getting right to it
On late nights we get tight, in ways I can't refuse it
Like cupids, we undisputed, and together ruthless
And all the other hoes feelin' low, lookin' stupid
Thought we was, we was two of a kinda cuttin'a rug
In back of the club, two of the most dangerous thugs
Soakin' up your brain, driving you insane
And leaving you to lay on your back constrained
With no complaint, she's off the chain like no other
My Mexican lover, the only one on my covers
Like hustlers, she got me tipsy shes got me voo-doo
And damn near foolish and one more gonna have me coo-coo
And kicked up 'til I'm tore up now what's the hold up
It's on now we back up on it, just as we post up
Slither at the bar damn drunk to the world
Burnin' down the club callin' on your boy Earl

[Chorus] - 2X
