Some people are nervous about the things in life
Running on ego, never satisfied
Some are unhappy, till [Incomprehensible] land
But I don't worry 'cause I'm in Gods hand

Say, amen, amen, say, amen, amen, amen

He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler of it all
He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler of it all

Some got a problem with the higher post
They enter to no one on a selfish coast
That's not for me and the world to say
God rules the day just like yesterday

Say, amen, amen, say, amen, amen, amen

He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler of it all
He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler of it all

Say, amen, amen, say, amen, amen, amen

He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler of it all
He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
Yeah, he's the ultimate ruler of it all

He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the master, I'm the servant
He's the king, I'm the subject
He's the ultimate ruler, oh yeah

Say, amen, amen, say, amen, amen, amen
