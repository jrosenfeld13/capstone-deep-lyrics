I don't want to sell you
I don't want to buy you
Feed you
Feed on you
Have you
Lose you
Force you
I don't want to have to
But it's you in slow-mo, it's you in the stream
It's you in real life and you in the dream
It's always you
It's always you

And every small thing turns into a big one
Like a roller coaster ride, but tell me when it's done
Spring
Summer came and left again
I see the sun and I know it's eating
And you're in the air and you're in my head
You're in every part of me, and it's okay
It's always you
It's always you

And when we meet on a rusty morning (By the sea or in the Peoples Park)
You will tell me the monster's crawling (In your legs, poisoning your heart)
So what, what are my hands for, if not keeping you steady?
So what if your head is sore, I'm here, you're not alone
But it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's always you
It's always you
