Thought you were moving so fast
Well here's some new
Things aren't looking too good
Its obvious
So much for a hastey get away
Could have been so much better
You didn't cover up your tracks too well
They're getting closer and your breathing heavy

Poisoned their eyes this is love at its worst
You were so wrong, so long
Should have thought twice before double crossing us
Never looked back, never look back
I'm not the one you'll get away with
I won't say goodbye

Stay quiet under the floor board
Crawl quickly down these dark hallways
Come on, son. don't worry
This is the last we'll see of this place
Trust me just stick to the plan
Follow me and i promise a new day
You didn't cover up your tracks too well
They finally found you and your breathing heavy

Poisoned their eyes this is love at its worst
You were so wrong, so long
Should have thought twice before double crossing us
Never looked back, never look back
I'm not the one you'll get away with
I won't say goodbye

Hey love come with me tonight
I won't be gone tomorrow
