(Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around)

Now this is how it started
My dreams all broken-hearted
Yet I want you, baby

We'll never be the same
'Cause you play those silly games
And yet I want you, girl

They said we were an item
My thoughts I tried to hide them
Yet I need you

But when we get down to it
I just love the way you do it
And I love you, mmm
Love can turn around

(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around)

I thought you were my lover
But you left me for another
Thought I need you

Don't read it in your letters
Don't you make me feelin' better
'Cause it's not true

Now in my secret vision
Forget about decisions
'Cause I want you, aha

I've got to have you near me
Girl I wonder: do you hear me
'Cause I love you
Love can turn around

(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around) Love can't turn around
(Love can't turn around)

(Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around)

(Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around)

(Love can't turn around
Love can't turn around)
