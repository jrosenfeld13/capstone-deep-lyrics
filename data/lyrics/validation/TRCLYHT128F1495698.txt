You're all I like, you're all I want
You're all I need, you're all I love

I'm not that type of guy
To be sayin' you love me when you hate me
Everything seems so wrong
When this relationship seemed to be strong

Holdin' hands, making all sorts of plans
When it doesn't mean a thing to you
If we try to get it on, I said I'll sing the same old song
Maybe baby, it'll be right for me and you

If we stay together
Maybe things will be the same
Give me a chance to love you
Like never before, oh yeah

We go out on Friday night
We don't have to argue and fight
You go your way and I'll go mine
And maybe we'll both will be fine

Then you try to go out with another guy
He don't understand you like I do
So, give me another try and I'll show you why
Why I think it should be me and you

If we stay together
Maybe things will be the same
Give me a chance to love you
Like never before, oh yes

You don't know how I feel about you
There's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
I'll give you all my money and all my time
Can't you see I'm trying

So baby, please stay
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Baby, let's stay together
Maybe things will be the same
Give me a chance to love you
Like never before, oh

Baby, let's stay together
Oh baby it will be the same
Give me the chance to love you
Love you all night long

Baby, let's stay together
It will be the same, oh yes
Oh yeah, stay with me, stay with me forever
Let's stay together forever, baby
