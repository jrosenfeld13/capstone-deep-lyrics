Faces the generation, reduced to vacant stares
Heads filled with TV static, buying its shallow lies
Jaded passionless whores, raping the desires of all
Dark intentions luring, false sense of security

I protect this sickness, as I watch in disdain
Their disease I guard
This bastardized American dream
State sponsored psychosis, burned in mass consumption
Every gallon wasted
Is ten more soldiers I must kill

Symptoms of consumption
Appetite for self-destruction
Free thought extinguished
Reign of dull complacency
Compulsive over-indulgence
Media-trained responses
Policy accommodations
Enraging our enemies

Incompetence facilitates attacks on native soil
Misdirection, weak responses, future wars encouraged

Refusal to resist the conditioning
Calculated flaws build dependency
Shallow fulfillment, relentless pursuit
The emptiness will never be satisfied

Culture of corpulence, overextended
Inflated existence, perpetuating conquest
Worldwide deployment to maintain control
Quelling backlashes of outrage

Fighting the next face of terror
Prepared for each new conflict
