Call me crazy if you've got it in you
But these people don't seem to mind
Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth
A little stubbornness will work out fine
A bottom feeder at the end of my rope
But I'm wondering where this rope began
Gonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down
It's just supply with demand
Nothing looks the same
Even when there's been no change
Say that something's gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

[Chorus]
When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

A large pickup truck with a little cargo towed
Gets from baker's to the laundromat
These daily fights all start to sound alike
I guess I'm gonna have to live with that
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Will I simply peel away
Feels more likely everyday
Say that something's gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

[Chorus]
When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

And if you came here to tell me that you're sorry
For the pain you couldn't cause
Then save your breath and use it
Just to regain what you have lost and look at the cost

It's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now
It's  all over now
It's  all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now
It's  all over now
It's  all over now
