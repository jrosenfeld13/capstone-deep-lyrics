Full moon, child of tomorrow
Full moon, free me from sorrow
Full moon, lead me away into the night I'll follow you
Over the dunes we will glide...

Full moon, goddess of dreamers
Failed saints, and unbelievers
Full moon, lighting my way in the dark
I'll follow you, over the wastelands of the heart

Sweet companion
I place my fate in your hands
Show me where the magic lies
Hidden in the sands...

Wild as the wind
Alchemist of pleasure
Steal my breath away
Lead me to my treasure...
