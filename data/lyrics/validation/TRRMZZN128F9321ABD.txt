They say you get what you need
When there's nothing but time
I'll give you yours
If you can find mine
But I've been out on this sea
On a wing and a prayer
And I can't see the good life
Any damned where
So I'm saying to you
And I hope you take heart

It is time
No more rhymes
Let's try and be who we are

You giggle at my words
It's enough, and more than that
I take it as a sign
And throw off my hat
Watch it sink, over the brink
To the bottom of the sea
I can love you
The question is, can you love me?
Despite my darkness and my drinking
Inside me there's a star

It is time
To let it shine
Let us be who we are

It is time
Let it shine
Let us be who we are

It's time
To let it shine
Whoever you are
