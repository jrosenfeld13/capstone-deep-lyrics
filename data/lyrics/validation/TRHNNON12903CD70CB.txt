Man you could be my new girl
Said you could be my new girl
New boyz (D&D)

To keep it 100 im ready for the next chick
My soon to be ex chick about to hit the exit
And right after she leave I leave the key under the mat
When you feeling kind of lonely you be free to come and chat
Know you heard them effin rumours like I beat then leave
But straight drop thats just gossip tmz
Guess the principal is, I don't give no refferals
Check into my district you can be the new girl

[Hook]
I had, so many girls that fade away
In my past I dont think its safe to say
But at last but I think that changed today
You made me think in a major way
You could be, my my my my my you can be my new girl. [x3]
Out with the old and in with the new girl

[Ben J]
I guess I seen a beauty of my life cause she was a beast
The typical freak she made it with me
How did she end up being caught up all in my world
Cause now I just imagine baby you can be my new girl
No jokes, no games im feeling you a whole lot
I ran into you and no turns it was a road block
Thinking to myself I had one of em in the past that didn't last
A chick with no class it was so bad
Damn now we in 2009 and im tryna make you my summer girl
You gotta dope mind
Lets go to Texas, Arkansa, Arizona
We can go to Michigan or live life in California my new girl

[D&D]
Everytime I look into your eyes
I wanna feel fireworks on my insides
You be here for me when I don't know what to do
I need a new girl
I need a girl who could give me some good loving
Cause I'm known as McLovin
I need a girl thats fresh and fly
We can stay together through the end of time
