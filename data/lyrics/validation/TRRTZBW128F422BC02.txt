It's not a confession, it's cause of fault
His hidden addiction is on the wall, everyone knows
Maybe he'll get by. MAYBE HE KNOWS THAT DISAPPOINTMENT
COMES FROM THOSE WHO LOVE HIM THE MOST
Tie off your veins and just pray for paradise
It's nothing but an emergency
The darkness remains, to pull you from your life
Left with nothing more, just the trust in me
I'll sacrifice to kill the addiction
It's not an abduction, it's the choice he makes
He caused the destruction with his mistakes, now everyone knows
You could say they've tried
But they should know that the outcomes of assistance are the chances he's blown
