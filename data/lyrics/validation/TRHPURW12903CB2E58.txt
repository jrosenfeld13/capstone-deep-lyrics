"Unwind pigboy, snap out of your rapture"
She said the words and his heart was captured
Just when he thought she doesn't speak, she moves
He should have known that he was in for abuse

And then came the deathblow
The final memento, the final memento
And then came the deathblow
The final memento, the final memento
(the final blow, deathblow)

"Unlip that sugartit, put down that gun
This ain't the kinda place for that kinda fun"
She took his hand, they walk out the room
By then he was sure she would be his doom

When they died that night
He couldn't see a thing
He smelled wind on the walls
And tasted blood on the sheets
Screams echoed in his ears

Deathblow, deathblow

Then life flashed by below the womb of embrace
They were entombed in the collapse of time and space
She laid him down and put her lap upon his head
Let him drown till she was nearly dead
