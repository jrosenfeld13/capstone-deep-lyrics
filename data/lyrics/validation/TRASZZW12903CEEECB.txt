What many wrong girls I have taken
How many times that I went wrong
I just fell fool of crazy ideas
But still Im singing one more time

You tell me I love you, but I dont know
How long its gonna last this time
You love the music more than your life
But now forget him, listen to me

You, I can really turn you know (female: I can really turn you know)
I, I know the girl for you (female: I know the girl for you)
Yes, I can see it in your eyes (female: I can see it in your eyes)
You, for sure youll win this time

You tell me I love you, but I dont know
How long its gonna last this time
You love the music more than your life
But now forget him, listen to me

And again ()
