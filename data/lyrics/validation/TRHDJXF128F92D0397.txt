Looking for reasons for what I did
Looking for reasons to live
Waiting at your doorstep another night
Scared to death of you sleeping around

Call you in the morning crying on the phone
Glad to hear your voice but your voice has turned ice cold
It was that very moment that I made up my mind
There's no longer no reason for me to try

Looking for trouble and reactions all the time
Like a teenage kid it makes me feel alive
Ask my mother: Does peace come along with age?
"No restlessness grows worse day by day"

I can't control my hope I can't control my dreams
I can't eat I can't sleep I can't do anything

Call you in the morning crying on the phone
Glad to hear your voice but your voice has turned ice cold
Leaving lods of messages, leaving you notes on your locked up door and your shut off phone
It was that very moment that I made up my mind
There's no longer no use for me to try
The worst case scenario is what we've been through
Worse than anything I can relate to
I've never moved on, I've always been stuck
Left so much behind without building it up
So long since I wished to get up in the morning
So longe since anything but singing had a meaning
The worst case scenario is what we've been going through

I can't control my hope I can't control my dreams
I can't eat I can't sleep I can't do anything
