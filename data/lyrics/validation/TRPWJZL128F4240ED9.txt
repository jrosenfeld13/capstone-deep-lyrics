Despite imagination being burnt and being blind
Despite your price for mercy, well I smile and feel refined
Despite your allegories for love and hate and war
I will love you for reasons insecure

And despite your wish is contrary my motives are impure
My rushing to another banner to find a cure
And despite the alienation my morality's obscure
I will love you for reasons insecure

And despite the animosity, the hatred and the fear
The sacrosanct pomposity which gives me so much cheer
And despite the words of hell, that I whisper behind doors
I will love you for reasons insecure
Yes, I will love you for reasons insecure, insecure
