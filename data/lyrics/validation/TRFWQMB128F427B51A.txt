Too much thinking can ruin you. (x3)

Too much thinking can ruin you. That's the style. Chaos is in
Imagining your death is almost a sentimental feeling

Giving a massage with a knife blade
Writing a love song with a loaded gun
Breaking concrete with your face...
Breaking concrete with your face is what dreaming disaster is like

That's... The... Style... (x2)
That's the style. Chaos is in. (x2)

(1, 2, 3, die!)

This is what dreaming disaster is like. (x4)

I will watch the sky until your ghost flies high, and crashes into a shooting star
We'll watch the sky, until your ghost flies hi....
I will watch the sky until your ghost flies high, and crashes into a shooting star
We'll watch the sky, we'll watch the sky...

I will watch the sky until your ghost flies high
(what dreaming disaster is like)
And crashes into a shooting star
(what dreaming disaster is like)
We'll watch the sky, we'll watch the sky
(what dreaming disaster is like)

.......... feels so necessary, feels so necessary (x2)

Blood is not enough for you to redeem yourself
Blood is not enough...
I will watch the sky until your ghost flies high
And crashes into the sky, and crashes into a shooting star...
