[Verse 1 - Ella Fitzgerald]
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

[Verse 2 - Ella Fitzgerald]
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

[Verse 3 - Louis Armstrong]
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

[Verse 4 - Ella Fitzgerald]
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

[Verse 3]
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

[Outro]
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever may be
You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little dream of me
