Piece of progress, advanced control
Absolute perfection, locked down into total war
Energy not prone to defect
Intelligent form of development
The race to live now dormant
Germinate the genocide, man's development demise
Dead shapeless bodies, decipher codes of lord war
Knowledge became extreme source - energy
Black smoke rises from power plant
Unthinkable war stored in banks
Whisper, arise, arise, defeat the mechanized
Gather all sick lives, fuel the source, the arise
Who rules power, fight no life, full taste of machinery
Total arise, full arise, the extreme heart or power
Man's brilliance, man's demise, fully exercised in technology
No flesh, no blood, mechanized fiend
Decipher codes phase four
Locked down into total war
Race is the true lord war
