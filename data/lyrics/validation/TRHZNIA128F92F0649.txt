I close my eyes
As fire swept clean the Earth
Nothing left to strangle
As the cords were torn from our hearts

"Tired I blew out my last warning, the claws were ripping me apart"

As we emerged
From darker dungeons
Splendor of yellow hells
Expanded swollen eyes

No words were said
As fire swept clean the Earth
Would the mothers be crying?
If they saw torches in our hands?

"The wind, once able to conquer, captured as fire swept clean the Earth"

A kiss was placed
Upon my cheek
And all color came back
Melting in solid blue tune
