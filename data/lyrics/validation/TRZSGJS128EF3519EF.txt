You are my light, I have to go on
Have me anyway you want to
Just take care and love me
'Til my tension's gone

'Cause you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late

Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon

Baby yeah

Oh, oh, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late

Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon

I can't say
(I just can't say)
(I just can't say)
It's here that you want me
(I just can't say, I just can't say)

Oh, baby, I don't want nobody
Nobody kissing you but me
(Can't say)
Oh, baby
(I just can't say)

'Cause you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late

Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon

Baby, oh yeah
Take me up tonight
And don't be late

Oh, you are my starship
Won't you take me tonight?
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
