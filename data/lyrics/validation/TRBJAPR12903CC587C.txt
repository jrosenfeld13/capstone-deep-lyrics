I am a shadow
I am a longing, and I'm growing
I am a silhouette
I can feel it
I'm nothing
And I'm living life
A sad wreck of a life
Long to be happy
And one day it'll change
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day

It's always the same
I thought the world was for all
I took a piece of it
I wanted to belong
And they said it was wrong, they said "let it be"
They said it's not for me
Well, they can go to hell
A sweet tasting hell
I'm not sorry
And one day it'll change
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day

And I sat on a bench
And I looked at the world
And I felt like a king
I felt like a king
A king of nothing
A king of nothing
But, yes, there's room to breathe
See, feel, live
And here's a reason
One day, one day, one day it'll change
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day
