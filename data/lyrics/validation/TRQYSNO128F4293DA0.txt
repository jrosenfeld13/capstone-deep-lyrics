Everything that I ever found
I'm switching over to a low tar brand
Got cable video with surround sound
I lie in bed and watch the world go round
Got CNN baby
Got ISDN baby
Everything is useless
Everything is stupid
Nothing's feeling new
Everything is useless
Everybody's clueless
Nothing's feeling new
Got Sherman filters and Virgin Peps
Got mini disc and virtual pets yeah
Fizzy drinks are gonna rot your brain
Got Patrick Cox mules and Donna Karan
I got the wide screen Star Wars Trilogy
Got belly rings and flings and Hard Candy
That's Urban Decay baby
Got Space NK oh baby
Everything is useless
Everything is stupid
Nothing's feeling new
Everything is useless
Everybody's clueless
Nothing's feeling new
