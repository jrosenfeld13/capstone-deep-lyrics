She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Don't ask her why she needs to be so free
She 's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
You got to catch your dreams before they runaway
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you, might will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
