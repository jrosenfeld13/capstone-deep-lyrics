I had to break away from you (From you)
And try to get used to me
Bein' alone is so brand new
I never felt so free
Can life allow
The fact that you're no
Longer thought of
It's honesty

Open a book, a picture's there
Of us when times were fair
Happiness was always so scared
To reach us in our pair
You left me there
Goin' nowhere
Of pain I was aware
'Cause it's you that had me there

Chorus x2
I made up my mind so let me go
I just wanna let you know
This time I know that it's for real
I know in my heart that's how I feel

I can't believe how you had me
So confused and weak
Alone and strong, I can go on
To understand my needs
Only in your dreams
Me and you
Could ever be
It's honesty

Half the time I was blind (was blind)
And I just could not see
All the damage that you did
You did do to me
I held it in
It's released
I was my own
My own therapy

Chorus x2

Bridge
I'm gone
You need to just move on
How could you not see
We weren't meant to be
I'm gone
You need to just move on
You and me no more
I'm sorry, it's over

Chorus x2

I'm gone
