[Verse]
Oh when your nine day feed is up and you've drained your loving cup
Come stands reeling to the shore oh when the brave are coming out
The dry fight and the dusty shout see you crawling on the floor
And diamond stars shining glitter bright gorging your sanhedralites
Words are falling to the floor glad stand pouring fruit trees
And now they glisten on the waterline sing home you are at the shore
I'm moving crissie pretty flowers in the shuttermaze
Haul up all your petty desires leave them lying down they fall
Wash away the rusty disease of your brown town days in our silver sea
Leave it dying at the door feather yellow your time to leave
Open out your arms and breathe

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to the shore now
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to the shore now come on
