I am softness
Sensuality
Intuition and
Duality
Life in my breath
I am receiving
Calm your fire
Deep within me
Endless rhythm
In our motion
I will bend to you
But you won't break me

I am woman...
I am woman...
(I see me through your dreams)
I am woman...
I am woman...
(And you will come to me..)
I am woman...
I am woman...(x2)

Enigmatic
All creation
Ever changing
Imagination
Hidden powers
True compassion
Seeking, yearning
Satisfaction
I am midnight
Lost in passion
I awaken you
So come and get me

I am woman...
I am woman...
(I see me through your dreams)
I am woman...
I am woman...
(And you will come to me..)
I am woman...
I am woman...(x6)
