Verse 1:
Talk to me baby,if you havin' issues
Don't be afraid to call me
I'm never too far...from you
When you need a friend for counseling
I'll be there,through everything, so you don't have to worry

Chorus:
You don't have to cry about it, scream about it
I'll be there to talk about it, and make it alright
You don't have to make a scene about it, don't pressure yourself
I'll be there to work it out for you

Verse 2:
Baby keep your head up
Your messing up your makeup, i won't let that...bring you down
Cuz' there's so much more, in life and love to live for
Tomorrow will be a better day
The sun will...dry your tears away, and i'll be standing there

Chorus:
You don't have to cry about it, scream about it
I'll be there to talk about it, and make it alright
You don't have to make a scene about it, don't pressure yourself
I'll be there to work it out for you

Oooh!(for you),for you there's no mountain high, or valley low(for you)yeah
There's nothing to replace this love (for you)
For you, i'll do almost anything (for you)
Cuz' baby, your the one i want to wear my ring

Chorus:
You don't have to cry about it, scream about it
I'll be there to talk about it, and make it alright
