I Will Bless The Lord At All Times
His Praises Shall Be In My Mouth
I Will Boast In The Lor, The Humble Shall Hear And Be Glad
[Repeat All]

Oh Magnify The Lord With Me
Let Us Exalt His Name Together
This Is How It's Supposed To Be
All Of The Saints Blessing His Name

For The Lord Is Good
And His Mercy Endureth Forever
Ifyou Love Him You Should
Always Give Him Praise
For That's Why We Were Nade
We Were Made To Give Him Praise

I'll Bless The Lord At All Times
