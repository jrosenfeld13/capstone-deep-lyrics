Tick tick time it don't mean nothing
Evil eye me high above
Tick tick time and time is money (is money)
Deep inside you can't deny my love
Gemini moon
Gemini moon

Tick tick time o mad desire
Black cat bone moanin'
Tick tick time o light the fire (the fire)
Deep inside you can't deny my love
The hanged man card
The sacrifice
The change of heart
Gemini moon
Gemini moon

Tick tick time a toil and trouble
Jet black coal my soul on fire
Tick tick time my mind is rocking (is rocking)
Deep inside you can't deny my love
Gemini moon
Gemini moon
Gemini moon
Gemini moon
Gemini moon
