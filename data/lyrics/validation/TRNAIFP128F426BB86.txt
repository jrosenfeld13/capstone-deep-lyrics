Well it's been such a long time coming
I thought you'd understand
That I'm so far ahead of the lines
You've been drawing in the sand

'Cause it's simple
You were wrong
You must have known that we didn't belong

I know you thought I'd sold my soul
But never told me to my face
I just had to leave you cold
And blow this shit away

Here we go again
