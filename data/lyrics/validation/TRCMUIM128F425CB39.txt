As I walked through the valley
Of the shadow of death, come across a man
His feet were planted in the ground
His hat in his hand

He said, "Hey, lovely lady
Won't you linger long and tell me a tale
Of love songs so sweet
And evil that's failed?"

For I've stood here so long
Weathervane of song
Holding down the spike
Waiting for lightening to strike

My eyes fell so low, they hit the ground
I mumbled my name
He said, "Girl, raise your eyes
Look at me, don't be afraid

It's all in your mind
It's only my skin that they took
I lived this life of loss for you
You've got to at least read the book"

Oh, I've stood here so long
Weathervane of song
Holding down the spike
Waiting for lightening to strike

He said, "Hey, lovely lady, what was it
Brought you through my valley floor?
All mornings come and gone
You never been here before

Said, "I ain't nobody made a road map
Lead you here
There are sign posts everywhere
But they ain't very clear"

Well, I followed myself
Through the wind, through the rain
Beyond all that stuff
Other side of the grave

I walked and I walked
Till I felt no pain
Till I felt no shame
Till I figured the game

Now I'm gonna stand here so long
Weathervane of song
Holding down the spike
Waiting for lightening to strike
