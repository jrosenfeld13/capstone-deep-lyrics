You know I don't do you wrong girl

When I go out sometimes

I'm just looking for answers

I know I ain't gonna find

I just feel like I'm drowning

In this whole crazy scene

I don't want my freedom

Just a run now and then

Chorus:
Let an old racehorse run

Let him open his stride

Feel the wind in his mane again

See the pride in his eyes

Let him bring back old memory

Of the races he's won

There's a freedom that flow

Way down in his soul

Let an old racehorse run

You know I do love you woman

But I swear there are times

When I'm watching the years slip away

Down that assembly line

I've been on for the money

I've got nothing to show

I' gotta get out in the wind

Every now and then and get out of control

Chorus (x2)
