[Verse 1]
Do you applaud fear?
Do you hold it near?
Are you afraid to live your life?
The way I perceive
In my arms I'll catch you
Do you mind If I always love you?
Do you mind If I always love you?
Do you mind If I always love you?
Do you mind If I always love you?

[Hook]
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes

[Verse 2]
You'll see
In my dream I'll catch you
Into my arms I'll catch you
Do you mind if I always love you?
Do you mind if I always love you?

[Hook]
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
