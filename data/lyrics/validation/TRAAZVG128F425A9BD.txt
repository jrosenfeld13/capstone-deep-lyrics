[Intro]
When you're looking like that
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's 5 foot 10, in catsuit and Bambi eyes
Everybody who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should have known I was wrong
When I Ieft her for a life in pity
But they say you never miss the water until its gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I failed to love you
And just taking it out tonight

[Chorus]
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

[Verse 2]
She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
Wanna squeeze her real tight
Get out of this place if only I can take control
But she's out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just to see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

[Chorus]
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

[Bridge]
I don't wanna forget you
I don't even wanna try
Am I supposed to walk on by?
When you're looking like that
How am I supposed to leave you?
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away (oh no)
If I can't take it back, I'm lost
I don't wanna live my life without you (live my life without you)
Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that

[Chorus]
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
