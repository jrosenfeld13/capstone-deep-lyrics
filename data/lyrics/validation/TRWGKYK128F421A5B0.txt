Let those feelings go

'Cause I let those feelings go from the inside
And I still can't find a decent reason to be anywhere
If I could fill this hole on the inside
I would trade the Charles for the James so I wouldn't have to see the snow

It gets cold looking in from the outside
It gets cold looking out on the world
It gets cold looking in from the outside
It gets cold looking out on the world

I spent a long time sitting on the back porch thinking to myself, looking in from the outside
I spent a long time looking for a place in my family, always looking in from the outside
I spent a long time looking for the words, no matter what I say I'm looking in from the outside
I'll spend a long time wandering this world and it gets cold
