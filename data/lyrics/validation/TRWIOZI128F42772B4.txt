Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words hold my hand
In other words darling kiss me

Fill my life with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I hope for
All I worship and adore

In other words please be true
In other words I love you
