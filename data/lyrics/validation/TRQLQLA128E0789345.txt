Apathy is what got me here, I sit around and wait
I watch the world across the room content with second rate
So called friend all pass me by, in and out my space
In and out my face, found another place

I don't know where it is, I just know there it isn't
I don't know what it is, I can feel something's...
I don't know why it is, but I feel something's different
I don't know what it is, something's definitely...

Solitaire, an empty room, the pot is in the bad
Winning seemed so easy when I cut the cards in half
Don't tell me that I'm all alone, I choose the path I take
Choose the path I take, chose to stay awake

I don't know where it is, I just know there it isn't
I don't know what it is, I can feel something's...
I don't know why it is, but I feel something's different
I don't know what it is, something's definitely...wrong

You blink and then it's gone
No one's behind you
And with one sweep, so long
Pass away, one more day
Turns to rage
It turns to rage

Laughing at myself
I'm the poster child for the one man army
Living on my past
Like it got me there where I never been, never seen

Laughing at yourself
You're the poster child for the one man army
Living on your past
Like it got you there where you've never been, never seen
Lost days, new ways, turn to rage
It turns to rage
