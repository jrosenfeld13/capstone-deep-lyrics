With cooling rain and warming sun
So long we lived here, disturbed by none
In freedom, peace and harmony
Like this it should forever be

The forest was our generous host
Until the day when we have lost
All that life once meant for us

It started long before
In another time, another wood
We heard about, but did not care
How could we know how much we should
Then dark clouds came upon our sky
We raised our eyes and wondered why
If only lion, eagle, ox and man
Had changed the world as long as they still could

Do you remember how it was before
Will those times never come back
Time never stands still
Clouds in the sky
It is too dark to see the sun
Shine on me
Clouds in the sky
Sun, shine on me now

Like a tempest they came over us
With a thousand hands
To take away in a minute
What took a hundred years to build up
They made us homeless, hopeless, helpless
They built their city, showed no pity
And as we run away
Always one step behind
We hear the sound of marching feet on burnt down ground

Once we will be the ones that are free
Will be the lords of the world
Dreams will be unfurled
If we unite and stand side by side
We can survive
Please let the sun shine on me
Shine on me now

And as we leave the tempest, we stare at all the strange shapes
And we don't know, where our journey goes
It is quiet in this dark land, so cold in this hard land
No matter how we try, we cannot read the signs

This place of misery lies far behind us now
But still we walk on
And as we lay down
At night we still can hear
The sound of marching feet on burnt down ground

Do you remember how it was before
Will those times never come back
Why can't time stand still
Clouds in the sky
It is too dark to see the sun
Shine on me
Clouds in the sky
Sun, shine on me now
Shine on, let it shine on
To another world
