We like boots and saddles
We love girls and guitars
We let romance and passion
Turn our heads and rule our hearts
Old bandanas and blue jeans
Campfires burnin' like stars
It's a song about all the things
We live and what we are

Dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, ringin' voices
Dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, songs about love

We got home in our hearts babe
Got the road in our blood
Got a cowgirl in every single town
Our name ain't mud
We like pistols and stetsons
Dance halls and cafes
Now you know where we're comin' from
Come and dance the night away

Dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, ringin' voices
Dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, songs about love

Yeah, dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, ringin' voices
Dancin' cowboys, singin' horses
Gypsy music, songs about love

Songs about love
Songs about love...
