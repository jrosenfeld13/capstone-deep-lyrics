Tonight I call out your name
And thought of you is carried on the wind
It echoes through the canyon like a train
Winding back home to me again

I can almost touch your face
I know you never went away

Everywhere I go
I can feel you
All around me
In the sunrise
In the moonlight
I breathe you in like the air
You're everywhere

I walk through the forest green
Far from all the chaos and the noise
And the river she sang to me
I could swear it sounded like your voice
There to comfort me

Soothing as a gentle breeze

Everywhere I go
I can feel you
All around me
In the sunrise
In the moonlight
I breathe you in like the air
You're everywhere
