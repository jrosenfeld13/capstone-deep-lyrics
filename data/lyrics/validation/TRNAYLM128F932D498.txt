You've made up your mind we don't want the same thing
And that we won't change things
Wishin' there were ways
And there's no use staying together
Nothing lasts forever that's what you say

And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us

I still believe we've got something worth saving
I keep hoping and praying for another chance
You've held my heart and your gonna break it
'Cause you wanna make it a part of your past

That makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us

Then that makes one of us...
