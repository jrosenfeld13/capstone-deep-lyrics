Girl - always giving me diseases

Girl - always cutting me to pieces

Girl - you're a girl, you're a girl

And all you're good for is to give me all your money

All you're good for is to just make me sick

I'll go to bed with you if you want me to honey

But it's almost time for Johnny Carson

So make it quick

You girl...

I swear you goddamn girls must have cotton for brains

You're no fun to talk to 'cause you're all the same

You make me wanna blow my lunch with your smelly games

You ought to be lobotomized, put in chains

Girl...

And all you're good for is to give me all your money

All you're good for is to just make me sick

You're nothing but a stupid stinking cunt, you ain't funny

I'd like to mask your stupid face to pulp with a brick

You girl - you dirty cunt

You girl - you mental runt

You girl - you're a girl
