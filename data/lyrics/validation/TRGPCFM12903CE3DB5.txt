Hearing rumors through the grapevine round you
'Cause they're rumors doesn't mean they're not true
Even if the headlines got it wrong
Where's there's some there's some fire and some burning remains

Complications, just ignore them for now
Always planned to go down with the ship anyhow
As the sinking vessel falls deep
The weight from the hull makes it break and bend

Like Slim Pickens atop the bomb
You hold on to the bitter end
Got your first start taking advice from these people that you call your friends
Snitches that stand in a row, didn't you know
You don't have to be like them
