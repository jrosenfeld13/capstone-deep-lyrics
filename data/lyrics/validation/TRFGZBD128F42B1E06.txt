Maybe ask her
Why water fills up her eyes
Baby tell her
Theres just no reason to cry
We'll find a reason to lie to her

Maybe after the water burns up her eyes
We could tell her
Theres just no reason to try
Without repeating her lines
Each time

This somebody makes you laugh girl
Is someone who'd make you cry still
In one day you've made your mind up
This someone is right enough- for girl

Maybe laughter
Will dry the tears that we cry
When we tell her
Theres just no pleasing this guy
He'd find a reason to lie to her

This somebody makes you laugh girl
Is someone who'd make you cry still
In one day you've made your mind up
This someone is right enough- for girl

Somebodys nodding off
She'll know it when shes ready and had enough
Someday we write it off
We know it when were ready and had enough
