Don't dance her down boys
Don't dance her down
Don't dance her down boys
Her man's in town
I played cards in England
I threw dice in Spain
I'm going back to England
To play cards again
Don't dance her down boys
Don't dance her down
Don't dance her down boys
Her man's in town
My Mom told me
A long time ago
To quit all my rowdy ways
And drink no more
Don't dance her down boys
Don't dance her down
Don't dance her down boys
Her man's in town
