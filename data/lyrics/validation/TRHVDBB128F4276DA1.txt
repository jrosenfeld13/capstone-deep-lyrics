Shot Down
Shot Down
Far gone you walk along a long road
Stole from a dream, the story you told
Preachers on the TV preachin 'bout the enemy
Only show that's on is hypocrisy

You wash your hands clean
And spread a message of war
You seed the disease
Somehow reaping the cure
Now your delusion
Grows bigger
You're the target
I'm on the TRIGGER

Shot Down
Shot Down
Far gone you walk along a long road
Stealing the scene with lives that you sold
Mother's on the TV crying for her family
Machine gun cornerstone for democracy

You wash your hands clean
And spread a message of war
You seed the disease
Somehow reaping the cure
Now your delusion
Grows bigger
You're the target
I'm on the TRIGGER

Retaliation/Submission/Retaliation/Indecision
Retaliation/Submission/Escalation
A fall to arms
