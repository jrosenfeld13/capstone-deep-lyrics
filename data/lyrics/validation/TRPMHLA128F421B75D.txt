We only have these dreams
We only have these moments
To shift the hands of fate
Reverse the flow of time

The truth is in our grasp
But destiny is only
A token in the sea
Of our intentions

Building bridges made of light
We will make our way to heaven
Blasphemy in vein
Borrowed time on angel's wings
Fighting future for the lonely
And we find we're human after all

We're only human
Human after all

Soon the day will come
When I will look you in the eye
And I will tell you
"The war is over"

With the veil of the sunlight casting faces in the sky
And I'm humble
And I'm sober

It only takes a moment
Before the heart percieves
Hearts that live and breathe in shallow water
Only make believe

Building bridges made of light
We will make our way to heaven
Blasphemy in vein
Borrowed time on angel's wings
Fighting future for the lonely
And we find we're human after all

We're only human
Human after all
