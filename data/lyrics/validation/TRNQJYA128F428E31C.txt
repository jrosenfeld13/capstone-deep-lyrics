Skinheads, coppers, all cock sucker, punks
Me I'm recovering from a nine day drunk
Hands of a bar maid
Bringing off a bald headed monk
All this and more for just one line of junk
I'll be your handbag
But I'd rather be your negligee
I'll be your handbag
You blow my mind away
You blow my mind away
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
Don't snatch me please
So cold that I could freeze
Now you got me on my knees
I'll be your handbag
Be right next to you
I'll be your handbag
Cause I belong to you
Cause I belong to you
