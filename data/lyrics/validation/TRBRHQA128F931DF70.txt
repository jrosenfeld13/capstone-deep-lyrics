Drive across the country, tell your story walking
No one's keeping you captive in the town that let you down, so sorry
Blame it on the television, blame it on the company
Don't blame it on the fundamental fact, that no one owes you something

I've come about my share, I only want what's fair
Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not greedy
Like everybody else, I wanna pay my dues
I only want someone to tell me who to make the check out to

A community of dabblers, who are vain and fond of biting backs
We hate it when our friends become successful
And a different school, whose energies are spent evading income tax
And silicone enhancements by the breastful

"Maybe we could run away and start a little repertory movie house or something."
She said, "Sorry, but I think you might be just projecting onto me
Why don't you try LA?"

Well, when you like something, it's an opinion
But when I like something, it's a manifesto
Pomposity is when you always think you're right
Arrogance is when you know

"Maybe we could start a little independent repertory movie house or something."
She said, "Sorry, but I think you might be just protecting your investment
Or else assigning blame."
