Morning came to Stepney
Like it was a curse
The cramp that gripped her childhood
Was getting worse

Morning came to Stepney
As if she were the night
The darkness was receding
Like her delight

I'm smitten
I've been bitten
By you

And though you lived in squalor
Your comfort was immense
Within the boho splendour
Of your pretence

Fidelity is safety
But safety is a bore
She wishes for perfection
And nothing more

I'm smitten
I've been bitten
By you

You come on like it's me you like
You come on like
Come on, come on, come on...

Like you've been smitten
You've been bitten
By me
