(Oh man... awwww... unhhhhh... aw, oh my head hurts)

My brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head
'Cuz I drank too much tequila, and I woke up seein' red
And now all I really want from life is to crawl back into bed
On account that my brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head

Well I woke up this morning, the phone was ringing
And my boss was talkin', just kept on squawkin'
Like a vacuum cleaner, like a barking dog
Like a headache screaming through my mental fog

Pulled on my pants headed towards the door
But the room began to spin and I fell to the floor
Almost made it to work, got stopped along the way
Two girls said "Hey, wanna come with us to Santa Fe?"
I said "I'd love to, but you see I gotta get to my job."
When they knocked me out and threw me in the back of their Saab

(and me, just minding my own business like that, you know?)

Well I woke up somewhere around Pagosa Springs
Both of 'em lookin' at me, gigglin' and whisperin' things
We arrived at their house, a big adobe palace
I gave a lecherous look to the girl named Alice

(oh Alice, what a dreamboat...I could tell we were meant for each other)

I could tell right away that they both were willin'
But the next thing that happened wasn't quite so thrillin'
They said "First you gotta come up and meet Mary's mom."
But it wasn't a mom, more like an atom bomb hit
And this came out from where the earth was split

Rolling pin in hand, Gestapo patch on arm
She was mean, and she bound to do me some harm
So I run down the steps in the front of the house
Back to the highway I scurry, like a mouse
Pick up my backpack, take out some rum
Take a big long swig and stick out my thumb

(Get me outta this place man, this is not what I signed up for...)

My brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head
'Cuz I drank too much tequila, and I woke up seein' red
And now all I really want from life is to crawl back into bed
On account that my brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head

(mmmm, my head hurts...oh yeah)

I arrived at work early the next mornin'
They said, "Where ya been, 'cuz the boss has been roarin'?"
"Never mind that, listen to what I say:
If you drink too much tequila, stay at home the next day."

(Don't mess with women from Santa Fe, take it from me.)
