[Chorus]
Yes, my friend, my friend
We are the street again
Yes, me friend, me friend
They set me free again

[Verse 1]
The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
They try to keep me down
But Jah have eye around
Yes, I've been accused many times
Wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They have got to turn me loose

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to cut me off on this bridge now
I've got to reach Mt. Zion
So if you a bullbucka, let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

[Chorus]
Yes, my friend, my friend
We are the street again
Yes, me friend, me friend
They set me free again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to cut me off on this bridge now
I've got to reach Mt. Zion
So if you a bullbucka, let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

[Chorus]
Yes, my friend, my friend
We are the street again
Yes, me friend, me friend
They set me free again
