[Verse 1]
A friendly wave each morning
Starting the day, neighbour
Next door is only just
A footstep away, neighbour

[Chorus]
You're pretty lucky to be alive
Hey, pretty pretty, you're barely alive, man
Look at me, the candy-coloured clown
They call the sandman
Sandman
Sandman
Sandman
Hey, pretty pretty!

[Post-Chorus]
I'll send you straight to hell
I'll send you love letters
Like a bullet, like a bullet
I'll send you straight to hell
Straight to hell

[Verse 2]
I'll bring you lipstick kisses
Forever in dreams, lover
I'll send your way love letters
Straight from my heart, fucker

[Chorus]
You're pretty lucky to be alive
Hey, pretty pretty, you're barely alive, man
Look at me, the candy-coloured clown
They call the sandman
Sandman
Sandman
Sandman
Hey, pretty pretty!
Sandman
Sandman
Sandman
Hey, pretty pretty!

[Bridge]
Kissy kissy, pretty pretty
Kissy kissy, pretty pretty
I'll send you straight to hell
I'll send you love letters
Like a bullet from a gun
I'll send you straight to hell
I'll send you love letters
Like a bullet from a gun
I'll send you straight to hell
I'll send you love letters
Like a bullet from a gun
I'll send you straight to hell
I'll send you love letters
Like a bullet from a gun

[Outro]
Like a bullet, like a bullet
Like a bullet, like a bullet
Like a bullet, like a bullet
Like a bullet, like a bullet
Like a bullet, like a bullet
