You can huff and you can puff
But you'll never destroy that stuff
Finally, I see why, I suppose
Kid, you better change your feathers
Cause you'll never fly with those things
In 'These Nights,' the boys sing
"Hello, emptiness
I heard you're alright
I've heard you're alright
I've heard of you"

A body aching, fragile, and pale
Dark valleys house its trail
Why can't you see that a life in art and a life of mimicry
It's the same thing?!

The room was crowded
And, though you couldn't care less about it, that much was true
That month
Another version of this miniature Rome to set fire to
Why did we stop fucking around?
Girls like gazelles graze
Boys wearing bells blaze new trails in sound

I looked up
I looked around
A famous Toronto painter shot me down
"Oh, I've busted my ass on these streets too long," he said
I set fire to the bed and tore his gown

Felt some mercurial presence, hitherto unknown
It was the sun, it was a stone falling through blank space
It was that jewel-encrusted roan getting in my face

Looked across the way to The Princess Rooms
I saw brides and their grooms
I heard the sound of bells ringing!

Cinders look back fondly upon a house on fire when across
An ocean we go
We row and we row and we tire

Now, step out of the darkness and into the light
Yeah, it's common knowledge I've been doing alright
No, I can't complain
On the East side, midwives' lives go down the drain
All cause our babies are dying

I lifted the veil to see nature's trickery revealed as pure shit
From which nothing ever rose cause nothing ever could
I swear somewhere the truth lies within this wood
I swear, "Looters' Follies" has never sounded so good
And, win or lose, what's the difference?
