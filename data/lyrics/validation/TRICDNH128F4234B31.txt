Oh!
On an early autumn day
Freshness of the breeze brought the mornin'
And the sun came risin' up
Shinin' down on leaves that fell like golden snow
And the mystery of it all
Made the problems of the day seem unimportant
That Oklahoma mornin'
Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my soul
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It warms up your mind and your body
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
Our campfire came to life
The crackling of the fire and smell of coffee
Turned back the time
To a day when a man could listen for a while
To the sound of mother nature
Without the sound of industry in the background
That Oklahoma mornin'
Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my smi-i-ile
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It'll warm up your mind and your body
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
One more time
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It'll warm up your mind and your body
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
Wooh! Thankyou
