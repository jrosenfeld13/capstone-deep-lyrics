Early in the morning when you're still shaking
And all you want is to come down
When you're so pale and your heart is growling
And all virtue seemed to have drowned

When all you've given and all you've stolen
Kneel down at your side
When all that seemed mended shows itself still broken
And you're feeling swallowed alive

Shake the tree
Shake the tree
Shake the tree
That sleeps in you and breathes in me

Now in your writing when you're so desperate
And all you want is to be touched
When you're so dry and your head is pounding
When your love becomes your crutch

When all your suffering and all your addictions
Kneel down at your side
When all that seemed mended shows itself still broken
And you're feeling swallowed alive

Shake the tree
Shake the tree
Shake the tree
That sleeps in you and breathes in me

One day your misfortune
Will shine like a crown
One day your misfortune
Will all crumble down

If you'd just shake the tree
Shake the tree
Shake the tree
That sleeps in you and breathes in me
