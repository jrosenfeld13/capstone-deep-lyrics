Everyday my hatred for what we are
Grows even stronger
Consumed by greed
We strive to mate and kill
Spreading out, like a virus
Everyday my hatred for what we are
Grows even stronger
Consumed by greed
We strive to mate and kill
Spreading out, like a virus
So what's next for us?
This is the age of extinction
A never ending plague
Bring forth the extinction
Tear it all down
Destroy our home
What was green will soon be ash
A cancer of the land
How much more can we withstand
Judgment day is in reserve
Extinction is what we deserve
The human race deserves to burn
The human race deserves to burn
Burn!
Hopeless!
Hopeless!
