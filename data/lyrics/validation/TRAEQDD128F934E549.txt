Walking through the alleys
Working through your vanities
Here comes another lesson
The lesson is life

Love me

Walking through the heavens
Walking with your devils
Here comes another lesson
The lesson you'll live, the lesson is life

Love me

I'm only interested in paradise
I'm only interested in paradise
I'm only working, working, working
Working, working, working, working so hard

I'm only interested in pure white light
I'm only interested don't want to fight
I'm only working, working, working
Working, working, working, working, working so hard

Love me
