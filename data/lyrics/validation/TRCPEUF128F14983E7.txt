Drunk at the bar
At last, last call
My baby is home on her night off
So I'm involved in a serious talk
With a girl I had known growing up
So we buy a six, we decide to split
She has a downtown apartment
She opens the door
Falls to the floor
Says "I'm feeling sick of sweet and pure
Take me now, I'm yours"
Oh

Notes in his pockets
Rumors in the mill
Phone calls after the bars close
Unlisted numbers

If she only knew that he'd be through
But who knows which parts are true
She hates how it looks, but what can she do
The girls all talk behind her back
They say she's being used
Oh

At Sullivan's drinking with Justin
He says he's seen my ex-girlfriend
She's back in town, and what's worse
He knows when and where she works
So we head over to the Underwood
She's trading shots with regulars
She gives me a hug 'till our hips are flushed
Says "boy we hardly kept in touch
It's time for catching up"
Oh

Notes in his pockets
Rumors in the mill
Phone calls after the bars close
Unlisted numbers

Still he insists on his innocence
Says those girls are all cousins
She's gotta drop the ax
Catch him in the act
With the shame around his ankles chained
The guilt around his neck
Oh
