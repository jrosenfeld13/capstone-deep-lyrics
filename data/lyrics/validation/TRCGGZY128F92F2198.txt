The lady cam from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor
She never saw my face

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

The lady's name was Suzanne Moore
Her daddy read her law
She didn't know that I was poor
Livin' outside the law

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

Her daddy said I was a thief
And didn't have her love(?)
But I (that?) was Suzanne's true belief
I married her for love (?)

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

The way she lived in ?
To keep the robbers out
She never stop to think it all
That's what I'm about

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none
