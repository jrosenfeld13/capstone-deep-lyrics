You need a friend today
But it never happens after knowing your name
Before people say good day they ask how much you weigh
Then they say your skin looks gray
You put a lock on yourself
And try to throw the key so far away
From all the demons, so called specialist grown-ups
Commenting between the cups of coffee
Putting you in cuffs
You are the writer of a novel of pain
Still no one understands
That you feel ashamed because - you keep it to yourself
Keeping it to yourself
You need a friend today
But it never happens after knowing your name
They say you have a distorted view on yourself
But how can the view be anything else but wrong
Hearing the same old song
You put a lock on yourself, and try to throw the key so far away
From all the demons and the grown ups, putting you in xxxxxxx cuffs
