I've never know your fucking' feelings And one side of my heart chose the correctness
Maybe right maybe wrong maybe unsane for my inner wish
Sweet child little child inside me he starts to burn You have understood but i can't dare
Touch my hand
Crazy senses shout and my question receive one cold not
It's the second time maybe right maybe wrong maybe unsane
Say me "it's too early" Sweet sin little sin rules my action and my dreams
I've understood but you can't dare your legitimate dubt is falling into sin your wonderful smile
