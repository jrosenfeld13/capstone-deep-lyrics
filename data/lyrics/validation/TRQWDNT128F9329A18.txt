This mutual misunderstanding here, I said
But it's obviously just been inside my head
No matter what I'd say, they won't be listening today
A correspondence has usually no point when done one way
You should know, you ain't worth it, why pretend?
They seem to think, you're not on the same level as our friends
You're not okay but if there's no way to get through in the end

Why bother to follow? Don't expect too much
Some people are always out of touch
There are persons who never let you in
Once they nothing, nothing, nothing
