Latchkey children, so we don't have to find a villain
Cause we're bored and sleepy face down on a desk
Gotta backpack full of comics and a condom in my wallet
I don't need another comment about not using it yet
But it's o.k. I'm gonna skip out early and cut through the lawn
To the cache of porno mags that we'll read until dawn

I said "f**k you", I'm not mistaking your downtalk for sympathy
And it's not true, your happy ending won't come about like this
We're like how. You're not gonna like at the end the protagonist ends up alone
Just like a cat wanders off to go die by itself in the snow

Focus all my vision on the uncoming collision for a second
Then I put it right back out of my mind
And I'll be sleeping at the neighbours with six dollars and a skateboard
I'll be working on the same trick, can I pull it this time?
And I get such guilt to chew, I'll chew it over
All the things we didn't do, I'll do it over
And if you let me I won't screw it up again
I probably will, I probably will, I probably will

I said "f**k you", I'm not mistaking your downtalk for sympathy
And it's not true, your happy ending won't come about like this
We're like how...You're not gonna like at the end the protagonist ends up alone
Just like a cat wanders off to go die by itself in the snow

I mighta had something back then
But it all fell apart from the end to the start
The chip on my shoulder ain't got any older or harder to hold

I might just need a break, but this world keeps spinning, world keeps spinning
All of this constant motion keeps me from winning, keeps me from winning
You better get here cause the keg might start to float
"No we got a long time....maybe...right?"

You're not gonna like at the end the protagonist ends up alone
Just like a cat wanders off to go die by itself in the snow
I mighta had something back then
But it all fell apart from the end to the start
The chip on my shoulder ain't got any older or harder to hold

We're like cats that wander off and die...
