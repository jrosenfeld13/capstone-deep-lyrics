[Chorus:]
Let the light from the lighthouse
Let it shine on me. [x3]
I wonder if the light
From the lighthouse
Would shine, would shine on me

[Verse:]
Here is my thought, this is my plea
Lord, let Your holy light shine on me
I wonder if You'll hear my prayer
I know I'm not worthy but I need Your care

Lord shine Your light, shine it this way
Shine it so I can see which way to take
My faith is in You, to see me through
I have one question...

[Bridge:]
I wonder if the light
From the lighthouse
Would shine, would shine on me

[Vamp:]
Shine on me
