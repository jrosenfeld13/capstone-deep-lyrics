[Verse 1]
World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune, yeah!
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings

[Chorus]
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

[Verse 2]
Run, run, run, away
Like a train runnin' off the track
The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
Never losing sight, oh!
Well just spread your wings

[Chorus]
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

[Bridge]
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh that's what dreams are made of
Cause we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh that's what dreams are made of

[Solo]

[Chorus variation]
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
Higher and higher leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher who knows what we'll find

[Outro]
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
Ohh, baby we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of

And in the end on dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of
