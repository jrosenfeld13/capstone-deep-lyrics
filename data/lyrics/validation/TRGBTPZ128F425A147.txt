Born to life abandoned by the gods
Helpless try to hide while darkness falls
My quest has been to rise above them all
So my anger and my pride has been my sword

When you're telling me I'm not the first around
That's just not real
'Cause in my own universe the history begins with me
I am not like someone else
I am The Deadringer of myself

A flickering light is chasing night away
A death mass for an alliance of betrayal
The coldest and most selfish of them all
So even though you're gods you have to fall
