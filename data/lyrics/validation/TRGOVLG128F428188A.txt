Where are you now
And who's by your side
Can't hide for a lifetime
Uncover your eyes

Wake up, in the morning
Share the sunlight shining down on us
You and me
Are these sad days always lost on us

Where am I now
And who's on my side
I'd wait for a lifetime
For you to come back

Wake up, in the evening
Share the moonlight shining down on us
You and me
Are these sad days always lost on us

Can anyone play me another sad song
Cause sad songs remind me of all that we've lost
Can anyone play me another sad song
Cause sad songs remind me of all that we've lost

Wake up, in the morning
Share the sunlight shining down on us
You and me
You and me
