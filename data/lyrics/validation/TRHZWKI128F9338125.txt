Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt
Yeah
Oh, yeah

Everyday is something new with you
Give me time and I'll know what to do
You're so frisky, love your style
Can I play with you a while?

Know you much better
It's not an easy thing to do
Such a flirt, yes you are
A [Incomprehensible] style

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah

So, you like body too, you say
It looks good in the mirror when you stay
Very chic yet so unique
From yours head down to your feet

We know you much better
Its not what you say or what you do
Your shapely breast gives you flesh
That seems to be your style

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah
