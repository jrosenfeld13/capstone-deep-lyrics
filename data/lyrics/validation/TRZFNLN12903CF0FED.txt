Erase superstition
Engraved in the mind
Seek out, locate
The DNA that hides
Mind-imprisoning to restrain life
Knowledge forgotten, believe the lie

Vivid as a raging tidal wave
Every last illusion washed away
Taking life for granted, lead astray
Saved by catastrophe

Coming again, signs will descend
Ride on the tide that marks the end
Time to unfold, life will move onwards
Breaking the waves

Complete exposition
Ingrained unseen inside
Structure of fate
The DNA decides
All we know but can't believe
Beyond all science and religions
Once lost now taken back, certain victory

Vivid as a raging tidal wave
Every last illusion washed away
Taking life for granted, lead astray
Saved by catastrophe

Coming again, signs will descend
Ride on the tide that marks the end
Time to unfold, life will move onwards
Breaking the waves

Insane in every thought
Unsane our ways
Reclaim the knowledge lost
Subjugating tide

Vivid as a raging tidal wave
Every last illusion washed away
Taking life for granted, lead astray
Saved by catastrophe

Coming again, signs will descend
Ride on the tide that marks the end
Time to unfold, life will move onwards
Breaking the waves
I am the tide, the iconoclast
I am the tide that marks the end
I will unfold and you will move onwards
On through the waves
