Ooh wee, ain't life grand?
They give you a dollar
Then snatch it back out of your hand
They rip you off for working
And they damn you if you don't
The only way you're gonna get out of this
Is to tell 'em that you won't
High society
Look what you're doing to me
High society
Oh, oh, the taxman
Won't believe me that I'm broke
But even if I could pay up
He'd still take me for a joke
High society
Look what you're doing to me
High society
Now everything I've said here
Is really just a joke
But maybe that's because a policeman
Has got me by the throat
