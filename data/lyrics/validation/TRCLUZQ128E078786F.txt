[Verse 1]
What I want
I want now
And it's a whole lot more
Than "anyhow"
I want to fly
Fly a fountain
I want to jump, jump, jump
Jump a mountain

[Chorus]
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see
I see no
Evil

[Verse 2]
I get ideas
I get a notion
I want a nice little boat
Made out of ocean
I get your point
You're so sharp
Getting good reactions
With your 'evil' talk

[Chorus]
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see
I see no
Evil

[Verse 3]
Don't say unconscious
No, don't say doom
Well, if you got to say it
Oh, let me leave this room
Cause what I want
I want now
And it's a whole lot more
Than "anyhow," get it?

[Chorus]
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see
I see no
Evil

[Outro]
I'm runnin' wild with the one I love (I see no evil)
I'm runnin' crazy with the one I love (I see no evil)
I keep on dancin' with the one I love (I see no evil)
You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You can feed the fires of the one you love (I see no evil)
You combine fusion with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love
