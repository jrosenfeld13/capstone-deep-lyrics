Song Name-Superstar. Album-Messy

See I've had my share of ups and downs
Been picked up and kicked back down
I've had my share of abusive partners
Then I fell pregnant at 17
A single parent with broken dreams
An education that barely mattered

In a house full of sisters and brothers
My nan and my dad and my mother
Me and my daughter will survive
Then my father was down with an illness
And my sister was down with an illness
Is there a God up in the sky?

(chorus)
All I ever wanted was to be a superstar
Sometimes I look
I can't believe that I have come this far
They said I'd never make it
They always said I would never amount to no good
But if I can do it
You can do it
Just follow your heart
And don't let anybody try and tear your dreams apart
You'll be a superstar...

My father said he was dying
No man could ask how long
Who knows?
Said I feel in to depression...

I turned to violence
But it weren't right
Mamma said it don't stop things to fight
Need to be strong now for your daughter

(chorus)
All I ever wanted was to be a superstar
Sometimes I look
I can't believe that I have come this far
They said I'd never make it
They always said I would never amount to no good
But if I can do it
You can do it
Just follow your heart
And don't let anybody try and tear your dreams apart
You'll be a superstar...

For all the tears I've cried
I built on my pride
It took the same to make me stronger
See, never have I given in
I let out the fighter within
Now I see believing in me
Was all I need

(chorus)
All I ever wanted was to be a superstar
Sometimes I look
I can't believe that I have come this far
They said I'd never make it
They always said I would never amount to no good
But if I can do it
You can do it
Just follow your heart
And don't let anybody try and tear your dreams apart
You'll be a superstar...

(chorus)
All I ever wanted was to be a superstar
Sometimes I look
I can't believe that I have come this far
They said I'd never make it
They always said I would never amount to no good
But if I can do it
You can do it
Just follow your heart
And don't let anybody try and tear your dreams apart
You'll be a superstar...
