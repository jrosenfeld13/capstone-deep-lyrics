And I dreamed a garden full of light
Just you and a man in white
And he tears the apples from your eyes
Just to navigate your rise

Waiting for the moment
When the night becomes kind
There's a shadow creeping through here
Will it reach your heart and mind?

Standing in the corner
Too tired to sense defeat
And you long to take this with you
But they yearn to be set free

I've wasted words of love and faith
True meaning came too late
And now they're just whispers in the dark
Just scars upon your heart, they're just scars

Waiting for the moment
When the night becomes kind
There's a shadow creeping through here
Will it reach your heart and mind?

Standing in the corner
Too tired to sense defeat
And you long to take this with you
And you yearn to be set free

There's a kind of hope that you hold on to
When the way is dark and there's little to lose

A kiss goodnight, a trap we spring
Don't turn me out, I've gold to bring
A kiss goodnight, a trap we spring
Don't turn me out, I've gold, I've gold to bring

Waiting for the moment
When the night becomes kind
There's a shadow creeping through here
Will it reach your heart and mind?

Standing in the corner
Too tired, I see fine
Are you holding up?
Is this situation dire?

Oh, please don't tire, are you holding up?
Is this situation dire?

There's a kind of hope you hold on to
When the way is dark and there's little to lose
Can you a build a life on your knees?
When the cost you paid is the prize you seek
