My old friend, my old friend come close to me
I want to talk about the sunny days
It's almost as if the sky fell on my shoulders
It's funny 'cause in my mind it seemed easy to talk to you

My old friend, my old friend she left me
She took along all our sunny days
It's almost as if in the sky fell on my shoulders
It's funny 'cause in my mind it seemed easy to talk to you

Now she's gone it snows over my smile today
Now she's gone and I know she is miles away
Now she's gone, in a sad way
It's a sad, sad day

My old friend, my old friend you hurt me
I trusted you and I was wrong
It's almost as if the sky fell on my shoulders
It's funny 'cause in my mind I didn't see it coming
I didn't see it coming, I didn't see it coming from you

Now she's gone it snows over my smile today
Now she's gone and I know she is miles away
Now she's gone, in a sad way
It's a sad, sad day

In a sad way...
