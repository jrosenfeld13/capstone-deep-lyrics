There's a place down on Tenth Street
Where I can go to rest my head
As I sit by the window
The city sleeps, I am home
It's another day, I'll spend forgiving
And another night, I wish I could get back
So if you'll sit and stay and talk with me awhile
I'll tell you to hold on to this scene as it passes us by
'Cause all of the days I wished for
Something just to begin
Standing out
On top as the Philadelphia skyline caves in
Looking out from above
I'll tell you what I really do love
I'll let you know
When I'm coming home
(When I'm coming home)
'Cause every little thing that you said
I wish you could take back
Maybe the next time remember
Come December I won't be home
'Cause I will be out on the road
To let you know, maybe one day
We can live with this and grow
'Cause you know
Philadelphia makes me feel home
We can all relate to misunderstandings
We're understanding now
With all the time it took for us to figure it out
Why can't you see?
All of the days I wished for
Something just to begin
Standing out
On top as the Philadelphia skyline caves in
Looking out, from above
I'll tell you what I really do love
I'll let you know
Philadelphia makes me feel home
Every little thing that you said
I wish you could take back
Maybe the next time remember
Come December, I won't be home
