The nights come down and the moments glow
The rats go by and by
Everyone just turns around and waits to feel inside
And down you came with all you know
And captured my desire
Aint it true you know Id find
That Im already tied

When theres no getting over
The riches that you gave
And within the light the shines from you
I bathe myself
I bathe myself, I

No point living without you
Yes Im glad I found you
You will be the one alone (I know)
You believe in pride
And you would leave my side
Who could be the one to know?

Your business will just steal your soul
And thats what I believe
But where theres truth theres poetry
It happens naturally
Now, I know how it feels to burn
And throw your life away
But I will lose myself with you
And find myself again

When theres no getting over
The riches that you bring

When was there any point in living without your love
Or any point in living without your love I hold on, and hold on, and hold on til the end

When theres no getting over
The riches that you bring

No point living without you

When was there any point in living without your love
Or any point in living without your love I hold on, and hold on, and hold on til the end

Hell, theres no point living without you

Living without you, without you, without you, without you

Living without you, living without you, living without, without, without, without, without

The rats go by and by, and by, and by
