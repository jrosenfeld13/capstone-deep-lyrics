Oh, Far away in Africa
Happy happy Africa
They sing a-bing-a-bang-a-bingo
They have a ball and really go
Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan

Oh, Take a trip to Africa
Take any ship to Africa
Come on along and learn the lingo
Inside a jungle bungalow
Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan
Hot drums are drummin', the
Hot strings are strummin', and
Warm lips are blissful, they're
Kissful of Skokiaan
