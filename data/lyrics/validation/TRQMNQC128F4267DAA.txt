[Intro]

[Verse One]
I was traveling on a lonely road
Going someplace I don't know
The way ahead was bleak and getting dark
Was it somethin' in the sky above
Or somethin' in a broken [?]
That made me suddenly think of you?

The memory of your face so sweet
And that awful day I had to leave
I can't help the tears that fill my eyes
This waitin' saps my heart
Tells how we've been split apart
And God knows how it gets heavier everyday
Everyday

[Chorus]
There's only one way home for me from here
And I be looking at you straight down through these years
I can see your happy smilin' face
And somethin' tells me that it's not too late
Till I be holdin' you
Holdin' you in my arms

[Verse Two]
I never wanted to give you up
But what's done is done
Let the past be gone
I can't change what happened
Or bring back the time we missed

You may think I left you behind
But each day I carried you in my mind
And all that time I drifted around
I was just getting nearer to you
I was just getting nearer to you

[Chorus]
When I'll be holdin'
Holdin' you in my arms
I'll be holdin' you and nothing will keep us apart
I can see your happy smilin' face
And somethin' tells me that everythin's in place
And I'll be holdin', holdin' you in my arms

[Instrumental Break - One [1] Minute]


[Verse Three]
All those years I worried
Trying to get in touch with you
Wonderin' if you'd still remember
Wonderin' if you knew

But always one thin's certain
I never gave up hope for us
That one day we'd be together
And that day is comin' up
And that day is comin' up

[Chorus]

When I'll be holdin', holdin', holdin' you in my arms
I'll be holdin' you in my arms and nothin' will keep us apart
When I'm a comin' on down to your front gate
I can see you there with your smilin' face
And I'm back here, holdin' you in my arms

Yes, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin' you in my arms
Yes, I'm holdin' you and nothin' will keep us apart
I can see your face cryin' tears of joy
And all I can say is: "boy, oh boy,"
I'm so happy to be holdin' you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
With you at last in my arms
I'm so happy to be holdin' you in my arms!
