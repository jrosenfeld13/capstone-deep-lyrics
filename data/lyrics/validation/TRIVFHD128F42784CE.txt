I'm so tired

All walled up
I can taste the winter
I would shut up if I thought that it mattered
That's what it feels like
When you're stitched into this skin
I feel stuck
And no one thinks something's missing?
Something's missing

[Chorus]
No one cares
No one listens
Screaming words that you fake hearing
No one cares
No one listens anymore

My eyes burn as I bury how I'm feeling
Close my eyes, its my life that Ive been stealing
If its all right, why do I feel a sense of longing?
I had it all and yet I thought that somethings missing
Somethings missing

[Chorus] x2

So paranoid, Ive been hiding from the sun
Im tired of being afraid of everything and everyone
Im so tired

[Chorus] x3
