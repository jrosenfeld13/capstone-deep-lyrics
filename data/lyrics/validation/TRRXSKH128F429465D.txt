I don't call it love
Come take me in your heart
Oh I can't get enough
I know we will never part
We are nightbirds my baby
Nightbirds will never stop
Oh you're playin' with fire
Lost in my desire
Baby you're so hot

My bed is too big
Too big without you
Baby I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
My bed is too big
Too big without you
Lady I wanna have no heartache
Come hit me with a shot

In a world of stone
Love never be the same
I hate to be alone
Tired of playin' games
You like cocktails at midnight
Diamonds and silver a lot
Oh you're a woman behind me
Oh set my heart free
Baby you're so hot
