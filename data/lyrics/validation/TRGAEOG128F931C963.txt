[Verse]
Oh, Mother Earth, With your fields of green
Once more laid down by the hungry hand
How long can you give and not receive
And feed this world ruled by greed
And feed this world ruled by greed
Oh, ball of fire
In the summer sky
Your healing light, your parade of days
Are they betrayed by the men of power
Who hold this world in their changing hands
They hold the world in their changing hands
Oh, freedom land
Can you let this go
Down to the streets where the numbers grow
Respect Mother Earth and her giving ways
Or trade away our children's days
Or trade away our children's days

[Outro]
Respect Mother Earth and her giving ways
Or trade away our children's days
