Come in, brother
Show some holiday feeling
Under wreaths and presents
Where to find patience
But we need to cry some more
Hear me now, hear me out
Years before we broke down
Years before, years before

Melodies come so faintly now
Memories seem so scarce
Melodies come so faintly now
Memories seem so scarce

Down the roads
You make the most of your twenties
Then we all grow old
But you do sooner than most
Just let me live before you die
To feel you once is enough
Let me make it right
Before you go, it's alright

Melodies come so faintly now
Memories seem so scarce
Melodies come so faintly now
Memories seem so scarce

Who are we, where are we going?
