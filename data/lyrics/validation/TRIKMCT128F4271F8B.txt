Smack someone, don't think twice
Do something, wake someone

Rock the boat
Rock this boat
Upside down

Crash, burn, let's crash and burn
Hit someone, save someone

Rock the boat
Upside down

Do it again, play it again
Shoot again, load it again
Top again, get out there again
Do it again, play it again

Rock my boat
Upside down

Do it again, get up there again
Load again, shoot it again
Play again, we're moving again
Go again, top it again

Crash, burn, let's crash and burn
Save someone, do something

Play it again, get up there again
Top again, load it again
Shoot again, get out there again
Top again

Play it again, do it again
Top again, play it again
Do it again, top it
