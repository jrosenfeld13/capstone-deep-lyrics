Don't make me tell you that you're the only one
Because you never said I was who you want
I fight to change you, you always stay the same
I wonder how much longer are we gonna wait

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know

You are the only one who
Can bring me down
Chasing something
I can never want now

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know, know
'Cause I'm gonna take it
As far as you are willing to go, go

And why can't we just meet in the middle, oh, oh
If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know
Let me know

Please let me know
Let me know
Please let me know

I am the only one who
Can take you out
Leaving something
That you'll never get now

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know, know
'Cause I'm gonna take it
As far as you are willing to go, go

And why can't we just meet in the middle? Oh, oh
If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know
Let me know

And maybe one day
We'll share a drink and get along
And clear the air, it's okay to live alone
And you don't need to tell me that you're sorry

'Cause I can see you left yourself so long ago
And this is where the both of us, we walk alone
And I can feel it wearing down to the bone
Down to the bone

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Don't act like you care

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know, know
'Cause I'm gonna take it
As far as you're willing to go, go

And why can't we just meet in the middle, oh, oh
If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know
Let me know

Please let me know
Let me know
Please let me know
Let me know
