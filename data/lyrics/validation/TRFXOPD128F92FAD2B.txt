So I flew across the country just to find your broken word
Like the dry wall in the bathroom of the hotel room she left me in alone
Excuse me while I let your secrets out
Does it comfort you to think about how wonderful this was up until now?

Cause this is closure once and for all
Oh, this has to stop right now
Cause I've been running for my life
And you could never catch me now

So I guess I'll just get going, I've got better topics now
And I'm off to find some blank pages to write all of them down
Because these ones have been dirtied with the mentioning of you
And you know I wouldn't say I hate you if it wasn't true
Because you're the talk of the town
And everybody's found it out

Cause this is closure once and for all
Oh, this has to stop right now
Cause I've been running for my life
And you could never catch me now

So I guess I'll cut my losses cuz I lost a lot
I guess I'll quit complaining and I'll starting walking it off
Because there is no point in living in a past with that unhappiness
Consider it a promise we both broke
Consider it mistakes on both our parts

Cause this is closure once and for all
Oh, this has to stop right now
Cause I've been running for my life
And you could never catch me now
Yeah, this closure once and for all
Yeah, this closure once and for all
And you could never catch me now
