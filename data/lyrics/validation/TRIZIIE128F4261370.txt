What's the matter?
Could it be that you wanna prove you're keen
And a man who's man enough to fight?

I'm not sorry for your lot
It's your job if you get shot
But you tell me that you not afraid

What does a hero feel about
When the rest of his fellows is lying on the ground?

[Chorus:]
Hurry up - Get a Gun today
Hurry up - meet your destiny
Hurry up - Get a gun today
Join them on their raid

Is your cause worth fighting for?
Or a country worth a war?
Hurry up and join the force tonight

What's the matter?
Could it be that you wanna prove you're keen
And a man who's mad about his pride?
