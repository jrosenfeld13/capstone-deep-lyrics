I see your red door and I want to paint it black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Never see the sight of me that changes every day

I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black

No more will my dream's eagle turn a deeper blue (handcuffed, handcuffed)
I could not forsee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it has been painted black

Paint it, paint it, paint it black
Paint it, paint it, paint it black
Paint it, paint it, paint it black
Paint it, paint it, paint it black as night, black as tar
Wanna see the sun blotted outside
Paint it black
