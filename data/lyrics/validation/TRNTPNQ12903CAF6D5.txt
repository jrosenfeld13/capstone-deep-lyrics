Well im told at days old she was left on the steps of a preachers door mom and dad they felt bad but that was one more problem that they didn't have what would it take to change there minds just one more someone left behind

Its a good world gone real bad and only love can bring it back

Now shes 13 and it seems she wants to look like the girls on the tv screen, she stayed thin she won't grin but a tiney little friend keeps a calling again

What does it take to change her mind just one more someone left behind

Its a good world gone real bad and only love can bring it back

If she dont promise she can't have but nothing changes if she dont if she dont try

Its a good world gone real bad and only love can bring it back

I said its a good world gone real bad and only love can bring it back - bring it back , only love can bring it back
