[Verse 1]
Savage heat is searing
Global warming has begun
Mother Earth is reeling
No protection from the sun
Forest fires are raging
While the rivers turn to ice
Foolish man creating
Mother Nature's cruel demise

[Pre-Chorus]
Hailstorms, tornadoes
Cold spells, untimely frosts
Heat waves and blizzards
Global death's the cost

[Chorus]
Faces the end of time
As we plunge headlong towards the day
Can't deny the signs
When the sun burns red
The earth will turn
From blue to gray

[Verse 2]
Winter turns to summer
Then the seasons disappear
No one needs a prophet
To explain what's all too clear
Oceans overflowing
Islands drowning everywhere
Leaders wouldn't admit it
Now they're crying in despair

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now rain shall wash away sad remains of man
Cities once so proud will crumble into sand
Buildings all collapse when all is done and said
The guilty ones will die with the innocent...
When The Sun Burns Red
