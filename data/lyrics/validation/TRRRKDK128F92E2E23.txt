[Admiral Freebee - Recipe for disaster]

Well I ain't gonna make the same mistake twice
I'm gonna jummp into the ring and hit her between the eyes
And the first punch comes hard and next one arrives a little faster

Baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster

She talks about me but not to
If you got a question, girl just shoot it
But overhearing your conversation, I am happy to be excluded
The only sound I wanna hear is the call of the stationmaster

Cause baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster
Cause baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster

Baby how long, baby how long, how long
Am I gonna let them push me around?

Baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster
I said baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster
Baby you and me, sounds like a recipe for...
Disaster
