I don't know why you fail me
I don't know how you dare
Stay calm now
Stay calm

I don't know why you call me
I don't know what you want from me

Ricochet
Voices
My trouble seems like distant dreams
My troubles seem so far away
Yesterday
It all seems like distant dreams
My troubles seemed so far away

I don't know why you miss me
I don't know what you want from me
Stay calm now
Stay calm

I don't know why you call me
I don't know what you want from me
