Look up, the sky is crying
Endless tears
Feels like my whole world's dying
It hurts when you're not here

'Cause you matter to me and that's why
You still matter to me
And that's the only reason I need to get by
You still matter to me, yes you do

I ain't no good at talkin'
So girl I'm tellin' you straight
My heart feels just like an orphan
I hope I'm not too late

'Cause you matter to me and that's why (and that's why)
You still matter to me
And that's the only reason I need to get by
You still matter to me, yes you do

If I could have just one wish
I'd stand you in my place
Then you'd know how much I miss you
You'll never be replaced

'Cause you matter to me and that's why (and that's why)
You still matter to me
And that's the only reason I need to get by
You still matter to me, yes you do

You still matter to me
And that's the only reason I need to get by
You still matter to me, yes you do

'Cause you matter to me, yes you do
And that's the only reason I need to get by (get by)
'Cause you matter to me, ain't no lie
And that's the only reason I need to get by (get by)
'Cause you matter to me, yes you do
And that's the only reason I need
