[Verse 1]
I'm cryin' everyone's tears
And they're inside our private war I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do?
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothin' would change, nothin' would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothin's any good

[Chorus]
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me go
I feel like I am the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Verse 2]
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay?
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothin's any good

[Chorus]
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
Will it ever go?
I'm the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Verse 3]
I'm cryin' everyone's tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There's nothing anyone can say to take this away
It's just another day and nothin's any good

[Outro]
I'm the King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
