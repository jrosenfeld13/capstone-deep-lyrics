[Verse 1]
Through the storms and the light
Baby, you stood by my side and life is wine
But there are days in this life
When you see the teeth marks of time, two lovers divide

[Pre-Chorus]
Sound meets sound, babe
The echoes, they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow?

[Chorus]
Babe, it's time we give something new a try
Oh, alone we may fight, so just let us be three

[Verse 2]
And baby, tonight
I see your lips are on fire and life is wine
Now the windows are open, the moon is so bright
Cause no one can tell us what love brings for you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Sound meets sound, babe
The echoes, they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow?

[Chorus]
Babe, it's time we give something new a try
Oh, alone we may fight, so just let us be three tonight

[Bridge]
Through the storms and the light
Baby, you stood by my side and life is wine
You feel the sweet breath of time
It's whispering its truth, not mine
There's no I in threesome

[Outro]
And I am all for it
Babe, it's time we give something new a try
Oh, alone we may fight
And feathers bend like trees in the moonlight
Babe, it's time we give something new a try
Oh, alone we may fight, so just let us be three tonight
