Well he walked up to me
And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered "I love you"
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine
So I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home
To meet his Mom and his Dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
Felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
Felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
