Where are the smiles, the laughter and fun?
Something is bugging almost every one
The pressure and fear, can turn very clear
There must be some way to escape

This mean ol' world can get on your nerves
So many headaches that you don't deserve
So if you don't mind, I'd like to prescribe
An old remedy, for you
For you and Me

CHORUS:
Now that we're together
We're gonna sing and try to make it better
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Now that we're together
Forget your cares and think about it later

Singing a song is good for the heart
Once you get started, it's quite hard to stop
You're such a great crowd. Why don't you sing loud
Oh sing out for me, for you
For you and Me

[Chorus]
Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Now that we're here
Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Now that we're together
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Now that we're here
Now that we're here
