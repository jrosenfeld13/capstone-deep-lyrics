[Verse 1]
It's been running for a long time
And it's running out in my mind
I can't explain it all to you
It's really jumbled up
So for longer now I'm messed up
And I'm wishing now
I'd 'fessed up
That concern's no use to you
It feeds the pain that stung
So forget how
I am dealing
Explain to me the feeling
It gets to that point instantly
You're ready to unload
And I'm the one you're spitting at
I'm ready for my fitting at
Doesn't make much sense
But when I get it calm it's slow

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
It's hard to admit anything
I'm sorry for the weight
I bring I'll do whatever's necessary
To make your mind glow soft
It's played out too far to stew
And I've run out of grace with you
So I'm out and take a walk
And we'll be better off
Whether I lied
As much as you tried
Whatever you decide
I hope it's good to you
For everybody's sake
Lord knows we all need a break
Do what you got to
This is hard to take
To the time I spent discussing
I'll sit back and stop the fussing
I won't mention it to anyone
And we'll be better off
I won't admit to anything
Sorry for the weight I bring
Do whatever's necessary
To make your mind glow soft
Whether I lied
As much as you tried
Whatever you decide
I hope it's good to you
For everybody's sake
Lord knows we all need a break
Do what you got to
This is hard to take
