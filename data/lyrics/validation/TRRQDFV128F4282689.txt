(M. Monroe & A. McCoy)

Now that I'm alright
Why don't ya hang out with me tonight?
Now that I see straight
I know tomorrow's a much better day
Now that we're back down on the ground
Where's all the fairweather hangers around?
Now that my life is sweet as wine
So exquisite, indeed divine

* Well the bitch's still bitchin'
The hooker keeps-a-hookin'
The hustler keeps-a-hustlin'
And the cops are out to bust 'em
But me, I've regained my will to live
A clean life with you my friend *

LOVE'S A BETTER HIGH
LIFE'S A BETTER HIGH
LOVING LIFE'S THE BETTER HIGH!

Oh honey, you're so sweet
How come it took us so long to meet
So very special indeed
You're the one that I'll never leave
Forget my notorious past
What doesn't kill you makes you last
As love will last for you and me
So very true to the point of extreme

* Well the bitch's still bitchin'
The hooker keeps-a-hookin'
The hustler keeps-a-hustlin'
And the cops are out to bust 'em
But me, I've regained my will to live
A clean life with you my friend *

LOVE'S A BETTER HIGH
LIFE'S A BETTER HIGH
LOVING LIFE'S THE BETTER HIGH!

Hey, let's get out tonight
Let's celebrate our life in love
Such a great gift from above
Now and forever in the kingdom of love

AMEN
