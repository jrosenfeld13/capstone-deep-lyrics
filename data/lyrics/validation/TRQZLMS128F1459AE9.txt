Listen up here's another lesson
Chapter 2 of this saga
Sparks yet another question
Are you doing just enough to get by
To try and fool 'em into thinking
That you live the right life
Or maybe thinking since you can't see Him
He can't see you
That's understandable 'cause
Then I used to feel it too
But we're responsible for every action
And like Newton there's an equal reaction

[Chorus]
You're afraid of what it takes to give it all away
Doing enough just to get by, just to get by

Thinking that you live the right life

It's so ridiculous to think you all just hearin' us
If you believe it let it known y'all be feelin' us
Not just the sound but the Trinity in whom we trust
It's already known who in the end will be victorious
And like KJ it's a 12-round knockout
I'll fight to the end and I'll be the one to walk out
Step out holdin' up the crown like a title belt
It's one bout the devil wish he never dealt

[Chorus]
It's all mixed up in your head about
What's wrong and what is right
What's right
