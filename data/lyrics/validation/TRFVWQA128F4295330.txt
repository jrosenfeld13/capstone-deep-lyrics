Another day is over and I'm on my way home
Knowing you'll be waiting is all I need to know

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

Forget about my troubles
Forget about my woes
You're the one who comforts me
Whenever I feel low

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

You're everything I could imagine
Fillin' me up with such passion
Eternity is not long enough for you and me

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy
