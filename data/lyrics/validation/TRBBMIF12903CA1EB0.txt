Voodoo power in the air
Mushroom's sticky sweet flower just siiting there
I gave some to my love and she lost all her hair
I ain't got nothing to give now 'cept a little bit of inner air
Seven sunshine women in a bed
Imagaphonic idols and blow their heads
Black slipper crawled up thru' them but they just didn't care
'Cause I didn't have nothin' to offer them 'cept a little bit of inner air
Well I got somethin' ta say if you really want to get your way
Put voodoo in that dark red wine and this is what they'll say
They'll say really want for this and you tell 'em there's just a little bit of inner air
