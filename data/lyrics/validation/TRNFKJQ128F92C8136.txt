[Verse 1]
All sweetly sung and succinctly stated
Words and music you calculated
To make you sing along
With your stereo on
As you stand in your shorts on your lawn

[Verse 2]
Get completely incorporated
By some couple who consummated
Their first love by the dawn
A falling star wished upon
And flashed in the sky and was gone

[Interlude]
And mouths wet and blonde hair braided

[Verse 3]
By the back room, the kids all waited
To meet the man in bright green
Who had dreamed up the dream
That they wrecked their hearts upon
He's the liar who lied in his pop song

[Interlude]
And you're lying when you sing along
And you're lying when you sing along

[Verse 4]
So, here's the car seat, so cruelly weighted
And here's the faces already faded
At the end of the day
When they just threw away
The only good thing that they owned

[Interlude]
And now they're pinned down and strangulated

[Verse 5]
But at the food court, the float's inflated
People line up to see
The man who dreamed up the dream
That they wrecked their hearts upon
He's the liar who lied in his pop song
The liar who lied in his pop song

[Interlude]
And you're lying when you sing along
Oh yeah, you're lying when you sing along

[Verse 6]
Week by week, it climbs up and comes on
And we're feeling alright, though we know it's all wrong
I'm ashamed to admit that I can't help resist what I wished was the truth, but it's not

[Verse 7]
And I truly believe we're not strong
And we'll sing till our voices are gone
And I'm singing in that manicured lawn

[Verse 8]
This is respectfully dedicated
To the woman who concentrated
All of her love to find
That she'd wasted it on
The liar who lied in this song
