Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
And I been dreamin' 'bout ya
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
And I been dreamin' 'bout ya

Hey girl girl you gettin' hotter
Hotter than the average temperature
That a man could stand if you hold my hand
I could be ya man

But I didn't know that you'd make this harder
What you tryin' to see, baby, running games on me?

(But I)
Girl, I will try to give my best to you
(Will try, to you)
And do the things the others wouldn't do
(They won't do)
'Cause, your expectations got so high
I could be your guy only if I tried
But I know that I gotta step my game up, yeah, yeah

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
When you walk to me on a sunny day
Got me heated but from not the sun

Girl, I've been thinkin' bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
Every moment pass when you're not around
Several come, so be strong

'Cause the scent of your clothes, the red blush on your face
Even your swagger makes me wish that I could grab a taste
Don't mean to come on strong but girl it don't feel wrong
And to be honest I could see us both together

'Cause you don't know
All the hoops I had to go through to get you a second in my life
No, you won't go
If I show you the real me, sweet and sensitive, real me

(But I)
Girl, I will try to give my best to you
(Will try, to you)
And do the things the others wouldn't do
(They won't do)
'Cause your expectations got so high
I could be your guy only if I tried
But I know that I gotta step my game up, yeah, yeah

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
When you walk to me on a sunny day
Got me heated but from not the sun

Girl, I've been thinkin' bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
Every moment pass when you're not around
Several come, so be strong

'Cause the scent of your clothes, the red blush on your face
Even your swagger makes me wish that I could grab a taste
Don't mean to come on strong but girl it don't feel wrong
And to be honest, I could see us both together

Don't be distant, don't be shy
With one try, I'll have you shaking, cooking, baking
Ooh, yes, baby girl you'll fly
And like what I'll do to you

Girl, I'll break my back to cover all your needs
As long as you is pleased it don't matter to me
If I break my back then it was all worth it to me
'Cause in the end I'll finally be with the woman of my dreams, yeah

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
When you walk to me on a sunny day
Got me heated but from not the sun

Girl, I've been thinkin' bout ya
And I've been dreamin' 'bout ya
Every moment pass when you're not around
Several come, so be strong

'Cause the scent of your clothes, the red blush on your face
Even your swagger makes me wish that I could grab a taste
Don't mean to come on strong but girl it don't feel wrong
And to be honest, I could see us both together
