War

Sometimes i want to borrow
Watching violence, after fights
Can she go to war tomorrow
To guarantee his rights

War war we don't need a war
[repeat]

You must be mad
That you sent us to war
I said if you sit down
We don't need to go to war

War war we don't need a war
[repeat]

Down the west in the crowd
With those of you who'll go
We're looking for a slag
Something to give us a fall

Whenever we get in a cage
Surely it does count
He's going to start a war
No one can survive

War war we don't need a war
[repeat]
