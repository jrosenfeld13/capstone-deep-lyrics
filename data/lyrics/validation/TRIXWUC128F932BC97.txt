I'm Black and blue
From the wind and the rain
I said I'm sorry for
All the lies and the pain
I never ever meant to make you cry
If I could take it back
You know I would
I'd rather burn up and die

So take a look at me now
Since I told you it's over
You gotta hole in your heart
I found a four leaf clover
You can't tell me this now
This far down the line
That you're never, ever gonna get over me

You sound a cross, it's a cross I bear
You're drinking hard, you're up late
Without a hope or a care
You're making do, to please who
Hope it makes you smile
You're not around for long
You gotta savour what's gone
And move your life right along

So take a look at me now
Since I told you it's over
You gotta hole in your heart
I found a four leaf clover
You can't tell me this now
This far down the line
That your never, ever gonna get over me

I'm lost and cold
And getting old
My head is full of lies I told
I've been down, been around
But I've fallen on my
Own two feet, i felt
I Left you out to drown
I never meant for that

I look around, sometimes I stare
I think back, now and then, I hope
You know I care
I walked away that day
Time to treat you right
But you were on your track
It was me turning back
I left you freezing outside

So take a look at me now
Since I told you it's over
You gotta hole in your heart
I found a four leaf clover
You can't tell me this now
This far down the line
That your never, ever gonna get over me
Never get over me
Never get over me

But you were on your track, it was me turning back
I left you freezing outside

So take a look at me now
Since I told you it's over
You gotta hole in your heart
I found a four leaf clover
You can't tell me this now
This far down the line
That your never, ever gonna get over me (repeat to fade)
