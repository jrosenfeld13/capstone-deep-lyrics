[Verse 1]:
Lying like needles on forest earth
Euphoric rush trees bend to pray for us
I'm sputtering like cold machines
Late for the birth ritual
Ritual, ritual, ritual

[Verse 2]:
You can drive my tail to watch the circus
A birth ritual, a birth of idiots
Now I woke up blessed and good strives for heartache
Marked for the death ritual
Ritual, ritual

[Chorus]:
As you start the song and face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime for every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual

[Verse 3]:
I took the drug to make me stay
And now everything dies in shyness
The snake retreats admits defeat
And waits for the birth ritual
Ritual, ritual

[Chorus]

[Bridge]:
Shining light
Child's highs
Mark his sides
Bright until the newness wears off

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ritual, ritual, ritual
