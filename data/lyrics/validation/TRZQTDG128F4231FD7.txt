I've got a tricked-out receiver
And I think it's built to win
I've got one chance to receive her voice
Translucent, delicate

Breakdown! Breakout! Eleanor
I think your loneliness is code
It symbolizes every man
Who's empty as a hole

Eleanor?I'm waiting for you

I've got a number to call you back
But I think "leave well-enough alone"
I chased a shoestring to a heart-attack
Closeted everything I own

Come down! Crash land! Eleanor
I think your loneliness is code
It symbolizes every man
Who's empty as a hole

Eleanor?I'm waiting for you

Flagship?
Come down?
Crash land?
My town?

Eleanor?
I'm waiting for you
