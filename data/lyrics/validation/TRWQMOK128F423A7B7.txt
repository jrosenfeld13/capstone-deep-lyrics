I'm alone, but remember
One wet and cold September
My tears were falling in the rain
I was lonely, I was blind
I needed her to ease my mind
Shackles of lust, chains of pain

I've died inside
Open my eyes
God, are You still there?
It's up to You
To see me through

With just a touch, I took a chance
A passion play turned avalanche
How could I think that this was love
Sea of lust, your evening tide
Dragged me down where dead men lie
I prayed for mercy from above

I've died inside
Open my eyes
God, are You still there?
I need to know
If You still care

Love me
Bring me back to You
Love me
Hold me close
Show me love that's true
Love me, love me
Don't ever let me down
Love me
Until I come around to You

Love me
Bring me back to You
Love me, my God
Hold me close
Show me love that's true
Love me, love me
Please don't let me go
If You love me, really love me
You gotta let me know
