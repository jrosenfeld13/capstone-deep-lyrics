You had plenty money 1922
You let other women make a fool of you
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?

Sitting there wondering what it's all about
If you ain't got no money they are going to
Put you out
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?

Get out of here and
Bring me some money too

I fell for your jive and I took you in
Now all you got to offer me's a fifth of gin
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Why don't you get out of here and
Bring me some money too
