Paroles de la chanson Confessions (parov Stelar Remix) :
But only lovers can stand each others cofessions
Back in an alley now they are around our way

Girl, I`ve been the lover of so many women now
Not to mention all the pretty ones
So forget about the panties and take off that
Brassiere my dear you`re so beautiful
Well it`s not an innocent kiss
Judging by the way you sucked my lips
But Talking about an innocent kiss
Except by the way your tongue made it through my lips

But only lovers can stand lovers can stand

Back in an alley now they are around our way

But Talking about an innocent kiss
Except by the way your tongue made it through my lips
But only lovers can stand each others cofessions

But only lovers can stand each others cofessions
Back in an alley now they are around our way
