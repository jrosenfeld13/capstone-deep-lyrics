Push, shove
Push, shove
Don't you push, don't you shove
Don't you push, don't you shove

My daddy would go crazy
If he knew what his baby
Was spendin' his life doin'
I know I'd be in trouble
He would cut out on the double
At the lifestyle I'm pursuin'

* I wanna be a toy!
I can't be treated
Like no ordinary boy!
I wanna be a toy!
I can't be treated
Like any other boy that you see!

Oh its really no use cryin'
When there's people out there lyin'
Sayin' awful things about me
I gotta bite my bottom lip
And clench my fist
Because a playthings what I must be!

(* repeat)

Push, shove
Push, push, shove
Push, push, shove, shove
Push, shove
Push, push, shove, shove
Push, push, shove, shove
Push, push, shove
Push, shove, shove
Rock it! Rock it! YEAH!

My daddy would go crazy
If he knew what his baby
Was spendin' his life doin'
Well its really no use cryin'
When there's people out there lyin'
Speculatin' what I'm doin'!

(* repeat)

I wanna be a toy!
I can't be treated
Like no ordinary boy!
NO!!!
