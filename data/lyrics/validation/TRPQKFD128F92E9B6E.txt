Imagination
Is funny
Makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I
I think of you

Imagination
Is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do
What to do

Have you ever
Felt a gentle touch?
And then a kiss?
And then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination
Is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example
I go around wanting you
And yet
I can't imagine that you want me too

[Instrumental Break:]

Have you ever
Felt a gentle touch?
And then a kiss?
And then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination
Is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example
I go around wanting you
And yet
I can't imagine that you want me too
