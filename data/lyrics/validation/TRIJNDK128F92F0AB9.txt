[Chorus]
Black Diamond Strings
This Black Diamond Strings
Drinking 1 W. Harper
Playing Black Diamond Strings
Black Diamond Strings
Are like white flour and grits
You play Black Diamond Strings
Cause its all you can get

[Verse 1]
Black Diamond Strings on a catalogue guitar
Thats pretty high cotton whoever you are
You break one you change one, thats as good as it gets
You can play all year long on two or three sets
J.W. Crowell was a hell of a man
He played two nights a week in a hill-billy band
He played at the Ice House on Telephone Road
And he played in the yard just to lighten his load

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Say hey, J.W, come on play that frog line
Let Old Rodney sit in, hell, he's going on nine
His fingers are bleeding, but he's keeping good time
Playing Black Diamond Strings, and hell never quit trying
And I cassette she told em both
She said, "You boys pack it up, its time to go home
We got church in the morning, man, its coming up dawn
Dont make me say it again or I'm gone
You can stay here forever, but youre going to walk home"

[Chorus][x2]
