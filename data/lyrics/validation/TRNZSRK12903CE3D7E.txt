You seem to follow me down
You seem to follow me down

Girl you got a fuse at the end of your heart
So once I light up, I don't think it will stop
You got a reputation for what you're not
And I don't really mind that, mind that
Don't want to be your man, don't want to be your daddy
I ain't your boyfriend; I ain't your caddy
You got to keep it real if you want to put it on me, on me

It's getting real dark on the edge of your mind
I've never seen a smile so hard to find;
Letting all the alligators waste your time
But, I really don't mind that, mind that

I want to walk you home at the end of the night
And throw you in the pool 'cause you're so uptight
I want to fool around 'till your clothes are dry
And I don't think you'll mind that, mind that

So let's break out and fold up the sun
To late to stop it now, here I come

Are you down, want to mess around?
We'll do it underground, won't let you down
Are you down, can we mess around, yeah
Are you down? Don't let me down
So, are you down, are you down, are you?

So don't cry if you're lonely, baby girl, come and show me
I don't mind if you tease me, having fun is so easy
Please don't lie when you kiss me
Don't pretend when you're with me
I know girls can be trixy when they're down

Are you down, want to mess around?
We'll do it underground, won't let you down
Are you down, can we mess around
Are you down? Don't let me down

So, are you down, are you down, are you?
