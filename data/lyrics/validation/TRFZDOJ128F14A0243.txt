She's like the wind through my tree
She rides the night next to me
She leads me through the moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
She's taken my heart
But she doesn't know what she's done!

Chorus:
Feel her breath on my face
Her body close to me!
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league!
Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind...

I look in the mirror and all I see
Is a young old man with only a dream!
Am I just fooling myself
That she'll stop the pain
Living without her
I'd go insane!

Chorus:
Feel her breath on my face
Her body close to me!
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league!
Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind...

Feel your breath on my face
Your body close to me!
Can't look in your eyes
You're out of my league!

Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind
Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind
Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind
Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind
