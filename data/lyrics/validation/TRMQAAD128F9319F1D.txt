Andrew's a starfighter pilot, he can get high in his jet
Tells me about all his women, he can get any I'll bet

You know I'll think of you, your picture on the wall
I would raise my drink to you, but I'll stay sober just for you
Just for you, just for you

Andrew's a starfighter pilot, he knows all the girls in the world
He's better than James Kirk or Tweeky, I cradle his picture at night
Andrew's a starfighter pilot, I watch him on tv each day
I've got all the toys from his programme and all of his past shows on tape

You know I'll think of you, your picture on the wall
I would raise my drink to you, but I'll stay sober just for you
Just for you, just for you

Lala lalala, lala lala, lala lalala, lala lala, lala lalala, lala lala
Lala lalala, lala lala...
