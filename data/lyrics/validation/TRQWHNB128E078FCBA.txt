I've got to carry Jah heavy load
Because I walk in His gladness
On His merry merry road
I've got to carry Jah heavy load
I've got to back up myself
Against false evidence
I've got to carry Jah heavy load
I've got to pick up where them say
Jah Jah left off and gone
I have to carry Jah heavy heavy load

In my meditation when I reason with Him
Clearly in my visions of dreams
He reason with me
I feel Jah Jah heartically
Oh I know what I do believe
I believe in Jah-Jah truth and rights

I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH
I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH

This rumour situation that is spreading across the nation
Trying to dim the lights
Been precious in my Father sight
Saying that Rasta Father
Trodding this earth no longer
But in Zion is my Father's Throne
And I know the earth is his foot stool

I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH
I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH

He said I feel it every day
I said its heavy every day OH
Jah Jah is a every day
Heavy every day
