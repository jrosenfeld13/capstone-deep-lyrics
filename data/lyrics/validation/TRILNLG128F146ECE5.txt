[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1]
Went out with the guys and before my eyes
There was this girl, she looked so fine
And she blew my mind
And I wished that she was mine
And I said "hey, wait up 'cause I'm off to speak to her"

[Chorus 1]
And my friends said
(You'll never gonna get her, you're never gonna get that girl)
But I didn't care 'cause I loved her long blonde hair
(You'll never gonna get her, you're never gonna get that girl)
And love was in the air
(You'll never gonna get her, you're never gonna get that girl)
She looked at me
(You'll never gonna get her, never gonna get that girl)
And the rest is history
(You'll never gonna get her, you're never gonna get that)
Dude, you're being silly 'cause you're never gonna get that girl
And you're never gonna get the girl

[Verse 2]
We spoke for hours
(She) took off my trousers
(Spent) spent the day laughing in the sun
And we had fun
And my friends, they all looked stunned, yeah yeah
Dude, she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl

[Chorus 2]
And my friends said
(She's amazing, I can't believe you got that girl)
She gave me more street cred
(She's amazing, I can't believe you got that girl)
I dug the book she read
(She's amazing, I can't believe you got that girl)
How could I forget?
She rocks my world
(She's amazing, I can't believe you got that girl)
More than any other girl, yeah yeah
(She's amazing, I can't believe you got that)
Dude, she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl
And I can't believe you got the girl

[Bridge]
She looked incredible
Just turned 17
I guess my friends are right
She's out of my league
So what am I to do?
She's too good to be true

1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 3]
But three days later
Went round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said fine
But I never asked her why
And since then loneliness has been a friend of mine

[Chorus 3]
And my friends said
(Such a pity, I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
I let her slip away
(Such a pity, I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
They tell me every day
(Such a pity, I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
It will be OK
Yeah, she rocks my world
(Such a pity, I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
More than any other girl
(Such a pity and I'm sorry that you lost that)
Dude, such a pity, and I'm sorry that you lost that girl
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
