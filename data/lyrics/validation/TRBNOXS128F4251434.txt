Now this one dedicate to my brethren Josey Wale

Old time sumting come back again
Go 'round di bend

No way no better than yard
Booda bye booda bye

Because up inna di hills a' weh mi stream so cool
Di janga and di mullet just a' swim inna di pool
T'ree sheep, goat and two black ram
Acres of banana, acres of yam
