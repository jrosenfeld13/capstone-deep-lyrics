Outside, they hear a different song than inside
What's in your heart?
You'll find they are just waiting for you this time to watch you fall

If you're drawing lines you can get off our side
We want to be wrong if what you say is right
Down on you, Down on you!
They'll never stop
And how can you?
Now can you use what you've got?

A fire burning inside of you, and they've tried to put you out
You'll find possibly maybe that you might die, not on your own
But they will tell you you're wrong

If you're drawing lines you can get off our side
We want to be wrong if what you say is right
Down on you, Down on you!
They'll never stop
And how can you?
Now can you use what you've got?

Your blankets of "What if's?" they're making us cold
We've tasted life wasted and it's getting old
"You'll never make it."
At least we tried
And if we make it, at least we tried

We've tried, we've tried, we've tried, we've tried!

You can not stop us
This is who we are
You can not stop us
This is who we are

If you're drawing lines you can get off our side
We want to be wrong if what you say is right
Down on you, Down on you!
They'll never stop
And how can you?
Now can you use what you have got?
