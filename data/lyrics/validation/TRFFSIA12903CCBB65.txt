[CURLY]

[Verse 1:]
There's a bright, golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright, golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as a elephant's eye
And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky

[Chorus:]
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way

[Verse 2:]
All the cattle are standin' like statues
All the cattle are standin' like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye

[Chorus:]
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way

[Verse 3:]
All the sounds of the earth are like music
Oh the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy, it don't miss a tree
An' a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me

[Chorus:]
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way

Oh, what a beautiful day!
