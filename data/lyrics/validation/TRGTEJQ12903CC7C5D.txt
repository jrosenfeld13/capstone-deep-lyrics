You see what shines in me
You see what shines
You see the light in me
You see the light
That runs right through me
Right through my hands
Till I can't see me or understand
But you see my light
You see my light
What I see as darkness
You see as my gold
When you've seen my darkest gold
You've seen it all
What I thought was empty
You long to hold
You see so much in me
When I see nothing left at all
And I feel you lifting me
With an open hand
And I long to trust my soul
In your open hand
And in this moment
I understand that I love you
And in this moment
I truly understand
How much I love you
