Bury a jar of shao-sing
When the girl is born
Surely you know the wine will age
Till she's fully grown
Dont fly into the night
Soon enough the world will end
While the lantern is bright

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown
Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown
Chain me down
Chinatown

Maybe I'll drink your jasmine tea
Then I'll hurry home
Surely you know the likes of me
Should be left alone
Why they like a me for
Soon enough the world will end
If I answer the door

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown
Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown
Chain me down
Chinatown

Look at the tall pagoda through
Through your window pane
Watch me fly your dragon kite
On a cold cold day
Youll discover the white
Orchids in my humble home
While the lantern is bright

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown
Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown
Chain me down
Chinatown
