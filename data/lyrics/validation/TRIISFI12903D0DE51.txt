If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in May-time
Would sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
The rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me
No winds of winter would blow

I gave you my love
And I was living a dream
But living would seem in vain
If I lost you
