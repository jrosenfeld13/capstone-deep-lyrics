[Verse 1]
Your smiles they don't come easy
Like they used to come before
The awkwardness and boredom
Is scattered out across the floor
I can feel your love waxin' and waning
And a quick look in your eyes needs no explaining

[Break]
I'm out on my own
Living alone

[Verse 2]
I'm an old reluctant gypsy
I don't like camping anymore
And the dreams and disappointments
Scatter out across the floor
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailing
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailing
I'm out on my own
Living alone yeah

[Bridge]
Something deep inside of me
Must have died some time ago
I haven't called no place my home
Since nineteen-ninety-four
I'm out on my own

[Verse 3]
Thirty-somethin' single
And tired of running' everywhere
And I can wear a welcome out
When I ain't even there
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailing
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailin'
I'm out on my own
Living' alone I'm living alone
And I got nowhere to go
Look at me I'm out on my own
I'm out on my own
But it's gonna be all right now
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
Oh yes I know it and I know and I know it's gonna be all right
