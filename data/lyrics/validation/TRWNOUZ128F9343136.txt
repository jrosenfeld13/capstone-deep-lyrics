Wise men
Thinking of numbers
Shaken not stirred
But I hang
Hang on your every word
These days
I roll with the punches
Always your clown
Do you remember when
We used to paint this town
Red gold green and blue
If you still believe in me
And you
Don't walk away
I know I'll find an answer
If you stay
Don't walk away
There's nothing in tomorrow
That wasn't there in yesterday
Oh no no no no no
All the heartache
Too many nights
In the heartbreak hotel
Don't you give up
Love is a carousel
Put on your dancing shoes
And we can paint this town
Red gold green and blue
If you still believe in me
And you
Don't walk away
I know I'll find an answer
If you stay

Don't walk away
There's nothing in tomorrow
That wasn't there in yesterday
I'm sad thats all
This cant be the end
It's not my fault
The rain on the roof
Reach out
Reach out
I'm drownin' not waving
Reach out
Reach out
Before it's too late
To save our love
Baby don't you walk away
Oh no
Don't walk away
I know I'll find an answer
If you stay
Don't walk away
There's nothing in tomorrow
That wasn't there in yesterday
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
No just stay
Baby don't walk away
(every cloud has got a silver lining)
Don't walk away
Baby don't walk away
(if you look hard enough you'll find love shining)
Don't walk away
(every cloud has got a silver lining)
No no no no no no
