I've touched some objects of faith more precious than pieces of eight
Seen sacred places and ritual ways, but for communion let's go to my place
I learned to pray on my knees
Been taken in hand, if you please
Had my own revelations, ideas about fate, but for communion let's go to my place
So as the body, so as the blood, sacred as the soul is to love
Don't be mistaken if you don't understand, divinely simple
Part of the plan
Take!
Eat!
This is my body!
I give it to you

Take!
Drink!
This is my blood
Do it in remembrance of me (so you won't forget me)
Now, I've been a witness of grace
Ive stared sacred days in the face
The long long parade of ritual ways, but for communion let's go to my place
Sacred stories are told
They're passed on like pieces of gold
So make your conclusions, consider your fate, and for communion let's go to my place
Are you ready?
Are you ready for communion?
