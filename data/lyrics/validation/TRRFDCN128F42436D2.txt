We could let this love be the fading sky
We could drift all night untill the new sun rise
Pass me a drink or maybe two
One for me and one for you

And we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee

Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow

When we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee

There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see, what we are
We are just

On a life boat sailin' home
With our drunken hearts and our tired bones
Well I just take one last look around
Yeah an' every place feels like a familiar town

And now we're free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
And dontcha wanna be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
From time to time a little
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
(hey now now)
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
I know you know your
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Feels so good to be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Mmm mmm mmm
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
