Wooo.. what a trial that a gwan a Rasta yard
Look at them a come with the machete and them gun
Them come.. them reap what them no sow
What a gwan in the early morning a Rasta ganja field
Come into the mountains
Sight I and I grandfather
Planting marijuana, naw make no war
Come with your disrespect
Take away I chalice, carry gone a campyard
And when you reach the campyard
You mash-up I kutchie
And the whole a Rasta weed gone aboard
You know why?
If you never sell it
How come you could a tell I, how much a pound for it?
Hear this!
Early, early morning the man them on parade
Run Rasta, run them a come
Hide the barn, hide the kutchie!
Come with your disrespect
Start boy-up I grandfather
Haul and pull him all over
Take away Sister Mary
From around the fire
Carry gone a prison ??
Come into the mountains
Sight I and I grandfather
Planting marijuana, naw make no war
I love the birds them
The birds love the Rasta
We reap marijuana together
Why you come to the mountains
Trouble I and I grandfather?
Planting marijuana, naw make no war
We naw run, we naw run!
Adopted from King Solomon
This marijuana, granted to the hands of black man
Now and then we smoke it
Another time we boil it
Good for all sickness and pain
Come into the mountains
Sight I and I grandfather
Planting marijuana, naw make no war
Go back a station, I come to save creation
Free marijuana at large
Go back a station, trouble some police man
We planting marijuana, naw make no war
Come into the mountains
Sight I and I grandfather
Leave.. the trouble that na trouble you...
