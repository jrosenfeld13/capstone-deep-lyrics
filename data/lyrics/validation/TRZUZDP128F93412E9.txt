If I pour your cup, that is friendship
If I add your milk, that is manners
If I stop there, claiming ignorance of taste
That is tea

But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
Sitting untouched and growing cold
