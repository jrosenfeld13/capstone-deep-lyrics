I like the shallow water
I like the open dell
And I prefer the secret
That I'm allowed to tell

I like the happy ending
I like the flying start
And I prefer the carefree
To be light at heart

I don't believe
There's seething under the surface
I don't believe
There're answers behind the obvious
And honestly I speak
With my toungue in my cheek
Beauty is only skin-deep

I like the sugarcoated
I don't think that Nick is old
And I believe that all
That glitter must be gold

I swim tabove the water
Naivety is my friend
The water of forgetfulness
Allows me to pretend
