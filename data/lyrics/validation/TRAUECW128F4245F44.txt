To me you're not, my ever thought
Not at all, 'cause if you want to see me bleedin'
You're just wrong

Hold your breath, turn your head
Leave me alone

Don't call on me, when you're down
Act yourself, every single doubt

All the worries, you are handin' on
I get them, pickin' up all the crumbs
Heapin' up, everything's changed

You won't be, my misery
You naughty boy, sail away from me
