[Verse 1]
When I first came to town
All the people gathered round
They bought me drinks
Oh lord, how they quickly changed their tune
When I first came to town
People took me round from end to end
Like someone may take round a friend
Oh how quickly they changed their tune
Suspicion and dark murmurs surround me
Everywhere I go they confound me
As though the blood on my hands
Is there for every citizen to see

[Chorus]
Oh sweet Jesus
There is no turning back
There is always one more town
A little further down the track

[Verse 2]
And from my window, across the tracks
I watch the juicers burn their fires
And in that light
Their faces leer at me
How I wish they'd just let me be
When I first came to town
Their favours were for free
Now even the doors of the whores of this town
Are closed to me
I search the mirror
And I try to see
Why the people of this town
Have washed their hands of me

[Chorus]
Oh sweet Jesus
There is no turning back
There is always one more town
A little further down the track

[Verse 3]
Oh lord, every god-damn turn I take
I fear the noose, I fear the stake
For there ain't a bone
They did not break
In all the towns I've been before
Well those that sin against me are snuffed out
I know that from every day that I live
Goddamn the day that I was born
And the night that forced me from the womb
And goddamn this town
For I am leaving now
But one day I will return
And the people of this town will surely see
Just how quickly the tables turn

[Chorus]
Oh sweet Jesus
This really is the end
There is always one more town
A little further round the bend
