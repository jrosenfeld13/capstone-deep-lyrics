Now this big ship was arocking, and my body's filled with aches and pains
Now if I get across the Atlantic Ocean, good people I will not live to Spain

Now the big tide is rising, you better lower your anchors down
Now if we don't make the circle, we never will get back to New York town

Now why don't you people quit laughing, I feel mighty sad in my mind
Said this big fog go to rising, and a cyclone is right behind

Now I feels bad, nobody seems to want to go my way
Says this big ship going to leaking, right between midnight and day

Now I see something shining, daylight is breaking all around
Soon as we make a few more lurches, I will be right back in New York town
