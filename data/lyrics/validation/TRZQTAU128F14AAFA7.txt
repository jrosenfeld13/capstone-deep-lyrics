[Verse 1]
Don't the stars look good tonight
Thought Electric Alice
In the pale moonlight

[Verse 2]
Don't the moon look big and bright
Thought Electric Alice
In the pale moonlight

[Verse 3]
I think I hear a baby cry
Thought Electric Alice as she passed by
Makes me feel like I'm a little child again
Thought Electric Alice in the silver rain
