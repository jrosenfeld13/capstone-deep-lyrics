Run into the woods

Talking branches will protect you

Father, come and see
I'm old enough to fight to my own death

I'm not your favorite one
I'm not your golden boy

Hide beneath a floor
A winding sheet for warmth and comfort

Father, come and see
I'm old enough to lift the gravity

I'm not your favorite one
I'm not your golden boy
