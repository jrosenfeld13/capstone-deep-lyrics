It's all around
People blocking their own ways
You said you're tired of delays
It's plain to see maturity
Would never be your destiny
So tell me now
What has happened to your face
You've been down the last few days
Seems sad to me how reality
Can drill into a fantacy
Cos you're the one
You're the only one
You outshine the sun
You're the only one
You've only just begun
And i'm already done
You're the only one
Bursting out
Everything you ever think
What did they pour into your drink
You telling lies would mean goodbyes
To me believing my own eyes
So tell me how
Your eyes don't even seem to blink
When your ship's about to sink
Wheres and whys and alibis
Don't go with your will to surprise
