Take a long walk down the countryside
Take a long, long time to clear my mind
Living behind these steel bars
Someone strolls along the ocean side

Looking up to the land of living skies
Casting roses through my tear filled eyes
I'm on top of all this countryside
Its far then its me

I'll be sitting on the beach
Thinking I'm a celebrity
Once its great and falls to my knees
Make our mistakes and take them to our graves

I've been taught this boring mountainside
Its far then its me
As I waded into the ocean
Waiting until I get me?
Welcome to the land of the living skies
While I'm drowning in the sea
Welcome to the land of living skies
Drowning in a sea of glory

I'll be sitting on the beach
Thinking you're a celebrity
Once its great and falls to my knees
Make our mistakes and take them to our graves

They showed you the room where you'd stay
Cold walls of concrete and clay
Through one tiny window you see
Armies of soldiers in green
All for you

After the smoke's blown away
Troops with dark horses at bay
As far as your eyes can see
Millions of men on one knee

All for you
All for you
