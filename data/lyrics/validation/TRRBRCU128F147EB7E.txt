[Verse 1]
Don't look back now
We thought we had it won
And all that we've left
Is the smoking of a gun
Fear is not the only device
That loneliness could leave us to fight

[Chorus]
Cause you're gone (gone, gone)
I told myself that you could be the the one
But you're gone (gone, gone)
And I knew it all along

[Verse 2]
My heart was kept
Far from the place you left
My eyes have seen
The favor move from you to me
Fear is not the only device
That loneliness could leave us to fight

[Chorus]
Cause you're gone (gone, gone)
I told myself that you could be the the one
But you're gone (gone, gone)
And I knew it all along

Oooooh, It's alright, it's alright (x4)

[Chorus]
Cause you're gone (gone, gone)
I told myself that you could be the the one
But you're gone (gone, gone)
And I knew it all along
