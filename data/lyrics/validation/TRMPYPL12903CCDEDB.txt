See the candle of life burns out before your eyes
Like a mirrors reflection death is wwhat you see
Cold blood flows through your veins
Death is a fact and to be embraced by darkness
Now at the end your all alone
No god will help you no heven to find
You walked your life like a human statue
Now when death takes you nothing remains
You die in solitude far away from the sun
In a cold and dark place beyond the living
In the forest of the dreaming dead
Your empty soul in a mindless tomb
Descend to the shadows of a dismal past
In an empty world in the cold and the dark
Beyond the living a grave of despair
In the forest of the dreaming
The lost and the dead ride the wings of evil
To the other side In the forest of the dreaming dead
Descends to the shadows of temptations eyes
The castle of souls awaits your soul...
