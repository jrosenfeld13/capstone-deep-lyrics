Sentimental gestures never
Meant that much to me
But if I had her here today
I'd shed a tear for all the world to see

Cut flowers sent
To a girl with sentimental ways
Cut flowers meant
More to her on ordinary days

A gentle girl who needed
All the love I had to give
But I was blind to her and would not
Give her what she needed most to live

Cut flowers sent
To a girl with sentimental ways
Cut flowers meant
More to her on ordinary days

Cut flowers, flowers, flowers
Cut flowers, flowers, flowers

Cut flowers pressed between the pages
Of a book she gave (She gave to me)
I go to her and say, "I'm sorry"
Then I put cut flowers on her grave

Cut flowers sent
To a girl with sentimental ways
Cut flowers meant
More to her on ordinary days

Cut flowers, flowers, flowers
Cut flowers, flowers, flowers
