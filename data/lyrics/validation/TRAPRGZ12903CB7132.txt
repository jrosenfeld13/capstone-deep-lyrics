Take her if it has to bethis way
I know she doesnt really want to stay
But be careful how you hold her
Please dont ever scold her
Shes my creampuff

We've been together a long, long time
I know her ways and she knows mine
So be careful how squeeze her
Please dont ever tease her
She's my creampuff

I pray to god above her
She'll find another lover
Who'll love her as much as I

I only wanna make her happy
Even though she made me cry

If things go wrong
Send her back to me
I'll be as happy as I could be
Cus I feel so lost without her
All the things about her
Shes my creampuff

I pray to god above her
She'll find another lover
Who'll love her as much as I

I only wanna see her happy
Even though she made me cry...

If things go wrong send her back to me
Id be as happy as I could be
Cus I feel so lost without her
All the things aout her
Shes my cream puff
