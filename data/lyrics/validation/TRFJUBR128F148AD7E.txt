Now you know
Places where I've lived
When I couldn't grow
Downward you'll soon drift
On the sailless boat
Nothing left to give
All I see is throat

Flowing glower
Witless knower
Seedless sower

If it's all a lie
Will you realize

Right before we die
My soul leads to the wrong
Changeling of the night
Now that I bleed a song
Purely based on fright
Sad with my face so long
I have this new sight

Flowing glower
Witless knower
Five steps lower

If its all a lie
Will you realize

Numbed the pain
Way high and real low
Now it feels the same
Have love or feel so
Hollowed out with shame
Hoping to see the day
With my brand new name

Flowing glower
Seedless sower
I'm bipolar

If I die tonight
Will you be all right

Then in time you'll find
Thirst becomes boring
Lest your heart and mind
Now that we're soaring
Over space and time
Done with exploring
All you are is mine

Flowing glower
Loopless Thrower
Breathless blower

If it's all a lie
Will you realize

Seek and you shall find
Everything in sight
Read between the lines
I'll show you the light
Here in the afterlife
