[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I dont want to leave my baby alone
I dont want nobody else to hold you
Thats a chance Ill take
Baby Ill stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
Its a chance Ill take, maybe Ill stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
Youre beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl its incredible
And I dont know what Id do, if I cant be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldnt want to go if I cant see your face, cant hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me Id tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I dont want to leave my baby alone
I dont want nobody else to hold you
Thats a chance Ill take
Baby Ill stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
Its a chance Ill take, maybe Ill stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 2]
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when youd be moving on
Id turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Cant stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldnt take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me Id tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I dont want to leave my baby alone
(My bay-beah!)
I dont want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this do me!)
Thats a chance Ill take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby Ill stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them bring me back to her
(???)
Its a chance Ill take, maybe Ill stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 3]
Oh no, cant be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Wont go, without her Id go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh no, cant be without my baby
(Don't you do this do me!)
Wont go, without her Id go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you girl! I need you baby! I want you baby!)
Ooh

[Chorus]
No, I dont want to leave my baby alone
I dont want nobody else to hold you
Thats a chance Ill take
Baby Ill stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
Its a chance Ill take, maybe Ill stay
Heaven can wait

[Outro]
Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(Youre beautiful, youre wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(Youre beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone
