The quick bullet: a tough one to dodge
And no one ever does
It cuts fast and deep (keeps you from sleep)
And you just have to let it bleed
I know the pain
It's all too familiar
If I could sing
Words to help, you know I would

And they would end the pain
But you will have to let this make you stronger
It's difficult to overcome

The name of a ghost
Still dancing on our tongues
So bittersweet (these memories)
I wish they could have taken me
And you will struggle through tough times
And destroy all your fears
Dont let this win over you

Soon you will end the pain
And you will say that it did make you stronger
This is how you overcome

(Voices fade away) And weve all heard it sung
(They fade away, as the memory) You really don't know what you got till it's gone
(The memory remains) And then you want it back so much
Nobody ever warned you

Breathe in, take in it deep
Cross your heart, it's yours for you to keep
Wishful? I guess I never was
I am looking up now, death can change us

Breathe in, take in it deep (And I will keep, pieces of you alive in me)
Cross your heart, it's yours for you to keep (Your spirit carries on.)
Wishful? I guess I never was (And I will keep, pieces of you alive in me)
I am looking up now, death can change us (Your spirit carries on.)

I will, stand alone
I will, learn from this, I will
I will, mourn the loss and I will be stronger
