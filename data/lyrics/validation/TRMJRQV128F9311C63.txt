I made it home today
Told some people that I'm here to stay but
Fourteen hours on a lonely road can
Get delusional
I got a brand new car
For half the price of a brand new starter
People said there's no way
She'll make it all the way

I'm here
In my '90 Cavalier
It's been bagged for 15 years
But I still like it 'cause it's funny
And everybody I know
Wants one of their own

I feel really bad
For driving something
Everyone wants to have
A couple flaws
With the heart of a Trans Am
Ya you're digging it
It's got a good luck charm
Thanks a lot to my backup alarm
Everyone's safe
But I've never done no harm anyway
