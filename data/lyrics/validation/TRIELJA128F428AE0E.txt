What better way to oppress us than to make us stay
To make us nod in approval to the limits we created
Our freedom - our bill of rights just assurance to make us abide
To make us serve their purposes and to serve our time

I will destroy a system that is built on greed
I will destroy a tradition that makes us bleed
I will shut down the power of all those who lied to me
I will defy their image of what they want me to be

Your symbols... your freedom
