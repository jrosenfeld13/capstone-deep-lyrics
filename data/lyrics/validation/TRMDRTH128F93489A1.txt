We are the Heavenly Father's children
And we all know that He loves us, one and all
There be a time that you find the answer
Another voice and call

If you're willing, He will teach us
His voice to obey, don't make no matters where
'Cause He know, yes, my God do know
Just how much we can bear

Though your load get heavy
You're never there, alone to bear it all
Just ask for strength and you keep on toiling
Though your tears drop fall

We have the joy of this assurance
His voice to obey, don't make no matters where
Because He know, yes, He know
Just how much we can bear

Spoken: Just think of the times, you have asked the question
Down in your heart, "Lord, what shall I do?"
Then again you'll find some of your friends and your loved ones talk all of your trouble
They can't do you no good, they're in the same trouble, too

Then your mind go back to, "There's a God that rules up in Heaven
In Him there relief from every pain or care."
SUNG: 'Cause He know, yes, my God do know
Oh, just how much we can bear

Though your load get heavy
You're never there, alone to bear it all
Just ask for strength and you just keep on toiling
Though your tears drop fall

We have the joy of this assurance:
Your Heavenly Father will always answer prayer
Because He know, yes, my God do know
Oh, just how much we can bear
