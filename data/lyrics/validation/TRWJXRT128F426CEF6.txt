[Verse 1:]
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darling and stay

[Chorus:]
Always late with your kisses
Why oh why do you want to do me this way

[Verse 2:]
How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late

[Chorus:]
Always late with your kisses
Why oh why do you want to do me this way
Always late with your kisses
