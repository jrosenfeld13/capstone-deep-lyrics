Intro(GIEL):
Three points
Sharp Edges
______
Lost in the triangle
Ever wonder where your
Where your strength lies
Now I'm fading
Time for another round
But I can't get out
Out of these ex files
This the place we
We come up missing
So we build our lives on trust
But it's not enough
Send a search and rescue party
To find our trust again
Chorus:
But we come up short
We come up short
Yeah we come up (come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up (we come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up(we come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up (come up)
Verse 1(butta p):
Can I be honest
Let me be honest
Sometimes I hate it
I wish I was flawless
Cause I made mistakes now
And I cannot change now
It's alright don't cut it
I had to do me now
It was selfish of me cause I sold him a dream
Every promise that I made him got shot down
Real talk broken heart
Everytime he see me now
Show me love, but remind me I would walk out
And I ain't never meant to break his heart
I promise
I should've been honest
But it's kinda hard when I'm on a pedestal
And if I step down then I'm looking kinda heartless
Truth is, I had trust issues
And proof is I felt stuck with you
I build up these walls and I can't let them fall
Cause I let my past build up like scar tissue
I ain't the only one
I ain't the only one
I made some promises I couldn't keep
I wish it was me
I wish I could back and tell him I'm weak
I wish I ain't cheat
Chorus:
We come up short
Yeah we come up (come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up(come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up(come up)
We come up short
Yeah we come up(come up)
Verse 2 (butta p):
I never knew I would be where I stand
My heart in my hand
But I freely give it
Cause you gave me a chance
You showed me your love
You told me to trust
And even when I wasn't worth it
You showed me I was
Outro(GIEL):
All I want is, I want to trust you more
All I know is that I want to trust you more
I want to trust you more
I want to trust you
