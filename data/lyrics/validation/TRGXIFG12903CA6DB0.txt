Victim of anger, tied to distance
Where does it come from?
Distrust
I've stood strong
Held my head high through constant war
So brutal, so violent

So I tiptoe through conversation
A lapse in my step is misperceived
Unleash a breath of salvation
In dormancy lies everlasting

Remember all the fires we started?
Our aspirations for progression
We feed the burning for a better day
Don't let your selfishness extinguish the flame

Prevailing with lasting intentions
Never living behind your back
Never living behind your...
Convictions leave me questioning
If you've been living behind mine
