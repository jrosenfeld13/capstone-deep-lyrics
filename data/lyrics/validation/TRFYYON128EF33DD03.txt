Do you still feel something
When you hold me thight?
I got a leeling that you dont
Will the flames be burning
Through our darkst night?
I got a feeling that it wont

Bittersweet as a potion
Full of fading memories
Bittersweet as the kisses from your lips
I can taste the agony

What about love?
What about the love we used to know?
What about love?
What about love, where did it go?
The love we used to know

The grass is always greener on the other side
You can buy it but I dont
And it aint no question who is wrong or right
You believe it or you dont

Who will hold you when youre crying
And console you when youre down?
Who will be there
In those cold and lonely nights?
Cause I wont be around, oh no

What about love?
What about the love we used to know?
What about love?
What about love, where did it go?
The love we used to know

Bittersweet as a potion
Full of fading memories
Bittersweet as the kisses from your lips
I can taste the agony

What about love?
What about the love we used to know?
What about love?
What about love, where did it go?
The love we used to know
