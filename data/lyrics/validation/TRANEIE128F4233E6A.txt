Everything was going seemingly as planned
Until we ran out of money in Amsterdam
22 gigs in 44 days
Everyone laughed at our naivet

Well I'm never doing that again, oh no
Got no money and fewer friends, oh no

Drinking too much the night before
Spent the next day on the bathroom floor
Throwing up between vocal takes
No one bought our first album anyway

Well I'm neveb doing that again, oh no
Got no money and fewer friends, oh no

Everything was going seemingly as planned
Until someone had a talk with the immigration man
The man said, "These three have got to go home"
So I was stuck in Tokyo all alone

Well I'm never doing that again, oh no
I've got no money and fewer friends, oh no
