We're growing up and getting by
Scared we might not make it out alive
The clock is running out but there's still time
Your life is on the line
It's either sink or swim
You lose or win
No giving up or giving in to them

Sing while you can
And don't pretend the future's in their hands
So make a voice, stop pointing fingers now
Sing while you can
Cause this could be the best years that you have
Our words are weapons, pull the trigger now

It seems the harder that we try
The further we keep falling out of line (falling out of line)
Our tongues are getting tired of telling lies
Our lives are on the line
It's either sink or swim
You lose or win
No giving up or giving in to them
(Don't give in to them)

Sing while you can
And don't pretend the future's in their hands
So make a voice, stop pointing fingers now
Sing while you can
Cause this could be the best years that you have
Our words are weapons
Our words are weapons, pull the trigger now

Sing while you can
And don't pretend the future's in their hands
So make a voice, stop pointing fingers now
Sing while you can
Cause this could be the best years that you have
Our words are weapons, pull the trigger now

Sing while you can (sing while you can)
And don't pretend the future's in their hands
So make a voice, stop pointing fingers now
Sing while you can (don't give in to them)
This could be the best years that you have
Our words are weapons, pull the trigger now
