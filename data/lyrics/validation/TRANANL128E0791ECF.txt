[Chorus]
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb

[Verse 1]
What is your target?
What is your reason?
Do you have emotions, is your heart freezing?
Seizing this opportunity to speak
You didn't say nothin but "turn your fucking cheek"

Dead Cell!
Dead Cell!

[Verse 2]
Sick in the head, livin' but dead, hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, mighty warrior, nothing's scarier
Kids are getting sick like malaria
Situation gets hairier, I'm throwing up all types of barriers, I'm telling ya
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the dead cells shout

Dead Cell!
Dead Cell!

[Chorus]
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb


[Verse 3]
Stop pointing fingers cause we all are guilty
Of clean cut lies and truth that's filthy
Believe what is the root of the word
Out comes lies when it's cut into thirds
I don't believe what my eyes behold (No!)
I don't believe what my ears are told (No!)
Seizing this opportunity to speak
I'm saying something, don't turn your fucking cheek

Dead Cell!
Dead Cell!

[Chorus]
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb

Dead - Cell
Dead - Cell

Dead Cell!
Dead Cell!
