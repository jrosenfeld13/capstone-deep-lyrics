Don't you go looking so surprised, baby don't you look so stunned
Didn't I tell you that a cold november'd come?
And deliver the leaves from green to red
To blowing in the wind stone dead

Well I never used to notice this awful quiet, mmmmh
And fall was just the calm before the next spring riot, mmmhh
Of wildflowers and lunatic rivers -
Sweat jumping off of the skin of love givers, mmh (in the park)

Scattered leaves don't lie
Aw' now baby, baby, quit your cryin'
Like everything that ever mattered, scit-scat scattered
Like every love word you heard
But that's just the way when you walk your days
In the beauty of this world
(repeat)

Pretty little disappointments all in a row
Been about a year since you disappeared through my door
And now you come back with your head on straight
But I got no love or hate left for you, girl

You must be the daughter of the late, late rose - I'm November's son
And I'm here to tell you, honey, ooh what's done is done
Yeah, I been claimed by the wind and the rain
There ain't no going back, naw there ain't no going back again (for us now)

Repeat chorus -- Scattered leaves don't lie
