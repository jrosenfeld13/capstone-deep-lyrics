[Verse 1]
You can dance around if you want to
But theres some thing a man dont want to do
And if you see him coming walking down the street
You better jump right Out to his way
Everyone knows its a street skit
Every time he comes to town
Because hes got something in his left hip
The blues down walk around

[Chorus]
Funky-junky[x2]

[Verse 2]
Hes on Missouri Boulevard
About a half old mile south of the graveyard
Better run an leap through funky old dirt
Go one dont find no shame
This old muskrat barbecue
And a sweetness on the rail-road track
Hes got a tiger in his living room
He got a monkey on his back

[Chorus]
