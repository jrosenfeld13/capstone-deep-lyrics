[Intro: John, spoken]
Hi, it's the Mountain Goats
It's the seventeenth of December
At 9:34 in the morning
And this is called "No, I Can't"

[Verse 1]
You bought me some candy
And you bought me some flowers
And you bought me a sofa
And you bought me a radio
Thank you for the candy
Thank you for the flowers
Thank you for the sofa
Thank you for the radio

[Chorus]
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need

[Verse 2]
You brought me a puppy
And you brought me a lamp
And you brought me some books
And you brought me a filing cabinet
Thank you for the puppy
Thank you for the lamp
Thank you for the books
Thanks for the filing cabinet
I don't know what I did without it

[Chorus]
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need

[Verse 3]
You came by, and you came in
And you let the wind in
It must be cold outside
We looked out through the sliding glass door
But I'd forgotten what we were looking for
Thank you for coming by
It's nice to see you once in a while
Thank you for the coat I forgot to mention
I've been freezing in here
I've been freezing in here

[Chorus]
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Yeah!
