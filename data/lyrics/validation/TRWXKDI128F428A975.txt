So, So You Think You Can Tell Heaven From Hell
Blue Skies From Pain
Can You Tell A Green Field From A Cold Steel Rail
A Smile From A Veil? Do You Think You Can Tell?

And Did They Get You Trade Your Heroes For Ghosts?
Hot Ashes For Trees? Hot Air For A Cool Breeze?
Cold Comfort For Change? And Did You Exchange
A Walk On Part In The War For A Lead Role In A Cage?

How, How I Wish You Were Here
We're Just Two Lost Souls Swimming In A Fish Bowl
Year After Year Running Over The Same Old Grounds
What Have We Found? The Same Old Fears:
I Wish You Were Here

I wish:
How, How I Wish You Were Here
We're Just Two Lost Souls Swimming In A Fish Bowl
Year After Year Running Over The Same Old Grounds
What Have We Found? The Same Old Fears:
