If you go away
On this summer's day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the nights were long
The trees stood still for the night birds song

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

And if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on the sun
I'll ride on the rain
I'll talk to the trees
And I'll worship the wind
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning , turning
Til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you
Let me tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
Til your next hello

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on you smile
I'll ride on your touch
Oh, I'll talk to your eyes
How I love them so much
But if you go
I won't cry
For the good is gone
In the word "goodbye"

If you go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away

Please don't leave me
I won't cry anymore
I won't talk anymore
I'll hide in your room
And I'll watch you
As you dance and you smile
And I'll listen a while
As you sing and you laugh
Please let me become
The shadow of your shadow
The shadow of your hand
The shadow of your glass
On this shadow of a man

Please don't leave me
Please stay
Please don't go away

And if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on the sun
I'll ride on the rain
I'll talk to the trees
And I'll worship the wind
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
