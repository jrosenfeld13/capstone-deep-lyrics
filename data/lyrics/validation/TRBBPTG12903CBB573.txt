Got that feeling inside
Like fire that will never stop
As the clocks run down
Got to show me what you want
Move move move a little tigher
Think think think a little sharper
Breath breath breath a little faster
Can you catch yourself
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, anynight
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, everynight
Tell you once, tell you twice
Comming for a second bite
I've been watching you
Staring up and down the line
If you worry ?bright?
You can catch again my eye
Move move move a little tigher
Think think think a little sharper
Breath breath breath a little faster
Can you catch yourself
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, anynight
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, everynight
Tell you once, tell you twice
Comming for a second bite
I call you, I call you
Got that feeling inside
Like fire that will never stop
As the clocks run down
Got to show me what you want
Move move move a little tigher
Think think think a little sharper
Breath breath breath a little faster
Can you catch yourself
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, anynight
Told you once, told you twice
Anywhere, everynight
Tell you once, tell you twice
Comming for a second bite
I call you, I call you
