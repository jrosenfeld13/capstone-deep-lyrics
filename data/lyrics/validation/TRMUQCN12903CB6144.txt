Let me take you on a trip, just a simple journey
A journey full of sound and beats
One that will lead you down, way down
To the underground, i said the underground
Where your body begins to tremble
And your hands become just a little nimble
The underground
Now let me see you work
Let me take you on a trip
Where the party children are waiting
And theres no concert playing
At the underground
Where you feet can take the flight
And the dj makes it right
The underground baby, the underground
Bu-bu-bump, and dance (x6)
If u can hang til daybreak, u know u r coming home late (x2)
The underground baby, the underground
Its dark in here, you can feel it all around, the underground (x3)
Now let me see you work
Bu-bu-bump, and dance (x8)
Let me take you on a trip, just a simple journey
A journey full of sound and beats
One that will lead you down, way down
To the underground
Where your body begins to tremble
And your hands become just a little nimble
The underground
