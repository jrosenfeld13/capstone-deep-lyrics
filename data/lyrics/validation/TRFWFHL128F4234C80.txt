[Verse 1]
Oooh, these feet carry me far
Oh, my body, oh so tired
Mouth is dry, hardly speak
Holy Spirit, rise in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

[Chorus]
And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
When I die

[Verse 2]
Have my body
Have my mind
Have my coat
Take my time
These I borrow
Borrow so far
Turn to dust
Fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

[Chorus]
And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
And understand
'Cause all men die
'Cause all men die

[Bridge]
And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
Since I'm gonna die

[Outro]
I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
'Cause all men die
