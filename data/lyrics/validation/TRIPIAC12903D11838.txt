It was never easy for me to live my life without you
It was never easy for me 'cause you've always told me what to do
If only you could see me now, what I became without you!
If only you could see me now, I'm not the same, I'm better than you!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, yeah!
And now I feel like such a fool that I approved what you've done to me
And now I feel like such a goof 'cause I knew you were untrue
If only you could see me now, what I became without you!
If only you could see me now, I'm not the same, I'm better than you!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, yeah!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel the rain is falling down on me, down on me!
And I feel... Oh! Yeah! Oh! Rain down on me!
