No matter what they say now I'm in love
I do it my own way cause I'm in love
And I can't keep that song out of my mind
Whistling that silly tune all the time

(whistle) ... I'm in love

No matter what they say, I don't care
I whistle any way everywhere
I wrote this little song on my own
She said that I'm a genius; I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy, I'm just fine
My neighbours stare at me, never mind
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl, I'm in love

No matter what they say now I'm in love
I do it my own way cause I'm in love
And I can't keep that song out of my mind
Whistling that silly tune all the time

(whistle) ... I'm in love

No matter what they say, I don't care
I whistle any way, everywhere
I wrote this little song on my own
She said that I'm a genius; I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy, I'm just fine
My neighbours stare at me, never mind
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl, I'm in love

No matter what they say now I'm in love
I do it my own way cause I'm in love
And I can't keep that song out of my mind
Whistling that silly tune all the time

(whistle) ... Ooh, I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy, I'm just fine
My neighbours stare at me, never mind
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl, I'm in love

No matter what they say now I'm in love
I do it my own way cause I'm in love
And I can't keep that song out of my mind
Whistling that silly tune all the time

(whistle) ... I'm in love

Ooh, I'm in love
