What if we were still together
Would I be happier?
And if Shannon Doherty stayed in 90210
Maybe she would have never met Alyssa Milano

Don't you wonder
Would it be better
Wheel of fortune
There's no answer
Don't believe it
You'll never know

What if I hadn't been to San Diego
Would I have scored a cheerleader?
And if Ben Affleck wasn't making movies
Would the world be better?
And if I had a unibrow
Would you like me that much?
Did Lynx save us from eternal smelling pits?
You will never know

Wheel of fortune
Don't you wonder
Would it be better
Wheel of fortune
There's no answer
Don't believe it
Wheel of fortune
Don't you wonder
Would it be better
Wheel of fortune
There's no answer
Don't believe it
You'll never know

Would we be dancing the same
If Michael Jackson hadn't made music?
Does the Internet make us smarter
Or does it just help us help us for porn?
And if I had been popular at school
Where would I be now?
What if? Whatever

Wheel of fortune
Don't you wonder
Would it be better
Wheel of fortune
There's no answer
Don't believe it
Wheel of fortune
Don't you wonder
Would it be better
Wheel of fortune
There's no answer
Don't believe it
You'll never know
