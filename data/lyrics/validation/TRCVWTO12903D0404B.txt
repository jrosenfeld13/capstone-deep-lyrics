She had five hundred dollars that her grandma left
She said for a rainy day
A hundred more from the general store
Where she stocked the shelves for pay
She'd had enough of those country roads
And the wind in the telephone wires
Said a prayer for luck, started the truck
Checked the mirror and spun the tires

Chorus
She said there's no such thing as a rainy day
And the world is bigger than the milky way
If you save it too long you're just throwin' it away
She rolls like the thunder
She's ridin' to the edge of the storm

She had her momma's smile and her daddy's fire
Their love burned deep in her soul
They were more than glad to give her all they had
As they pushed her from the fold
The road gets wider mile my mile
As she heads east toward the dawn
The clouds press down, the lightning sounds
Lilly turns those wipers on

Chorus

The cards come in from Fond Du Lac
New Orleans and Chilliwack
She said one of these days I'm comin' back
But I'm not gonna stay

Chorus
