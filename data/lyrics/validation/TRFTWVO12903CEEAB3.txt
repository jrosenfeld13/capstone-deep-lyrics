Look around you've got a good thing
You don't ever have to make the money
You've got a little room to spread out
And a table for some company

You can take your time to work things out
It'll be alright. Just don't give up

I know what you're thinking
Hearing all the good news
To say it would be shameful
To keep it in means you lose

You can take your time to work things out
It'll be alright. Just don't give up

I wish I could remember
The refrain that I had written
Surely they were sage words
To assure you you're forgiven
I know where you're going
Maybe you should reconsider

You can take your time to work things out
It'll be alright. Just don't give up
You can take your time to work things out

Do you think I judge you
Tell me how it looks to love you
I am not a stranger
I know you well
And it's hard to tell...

You can take your time to work things out
It'll be alright. Just don't screw up

You can take your time to work things out
It'll be alright. Just don't hang up

You can take your time
