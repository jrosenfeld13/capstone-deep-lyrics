[Dallas:]
Look around, look around. There's no affection only infection
Search yourself, search yourself. Can I depend on you to surrender?

[George:]
And we will storm their shores
Eyes suffocating all they see
Feet sturdy on the rubble that will soon be dust
And there will be no ruins, no memory, no history
Only our unrelenting march side by side
We'll comb the earth
And sweep it clean with hearts and feat unified
The hand of man is no match for our warless army

[Chorus]
[Dallas:] Please tell me that this is the end of the world, it's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
[George:] {And we will strike with the hands of god and leave nothing in our wake} {And we will strike with the hands of god and with a word we'll see fate}

[Dallas:] Please tell me that this is the end of the world, it's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
[George:] {And we will strike with the hands of god and leave nothing in our wake} {And we will strike with the hands of god as we choke in our wage}

[George:]
Steadfast soldiers with hands of gods
And the numbers to succeed
We will persist until all that's left
Is a perfect sphere
Never a break a chain
Never a folly of conviction
And may the traitor's ashes
Seal the barren landscape

[All:]
We Are The End
We Are The End

[Chorus]
[Dallas:]
Look around, look around. There's no affection only infection
Search yourself, search yourself. Can I depend on you to surrender?
Can I depend on you to surrender?

[Chorus]
