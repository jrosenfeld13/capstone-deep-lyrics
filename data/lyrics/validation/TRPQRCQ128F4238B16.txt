[Intro]
Yo, all the ladies in the dance
(to each and every princess)
Ey oh, oh (yo, bless)

[Verse 1]
I lose all control when I see you standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair, you flair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance and de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin' for a taste

[Chorus]
Before the end of the night (the night)
I wanna hold you so tight (so tight)
You know I want you so much (so much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I am tempted)
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

[Interlude]
Yo, to all my ladies in the dance (I'm, lookin' at these ladies)
Ey oh, oh (thinkin' one of them havin' my babies, uh)

[Verse 2]
I don't even know your name
Little woman I don't even know your age (for real)
But there's something about you girl
When I see you wining in front the stage (something about you)
Please forgive me, please excuse me
But there's nothing else that a man can do (excuse me)
I cannot pass or think ah woman I just need to be next to you (come, uh, yo)

[Chorus]
Before the end of the night (the night)
I wanna hold you so tight (so tight)
You know I want you so much (so much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I am tempted)
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

[Bridge]
I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
I'll place no one else above you
I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
You know woman I wanna wings of a dove you

[Chorus]
Before the end of the night (the night)
I wanna hold you so tight (so tight)
You know I want you so much (so much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I am tempted)
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

[Interlude]
Yo, to all the ladies in the dance
Ey oh, oh

[Verse 3]

Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin' for a taste

[Chorus]
Before the end of the night (the night)
I wanna hold you so tight (so tight)
You know I want you so much (so much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I am tempted)

Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
