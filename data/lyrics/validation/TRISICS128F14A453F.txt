Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight, oh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
A-Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
A-Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
And then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

[Scatting]

A-Jingle bells, jingle bells
A-Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle bells, jingle bells
A-Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle Bells, jingle Bells
Jingle jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells, jingle Bells
Jingle jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A-Jingle bells
All, all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, yay

I'm just crazy about horses
