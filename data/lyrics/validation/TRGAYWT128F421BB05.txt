2080 - Our world is an empty domain
Emotions have died
Men bleeding oil are the heroes for children today

Drinking the blood of the weak dictators bring pain
But they show us a smile
Feelings and love are kept hidden in a Madhouse cave

It's a mad revolution
And the spirits will die
Oh escape the confusion
Take my hand

Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand

We won't be so free
Until we rise again

Eden is mad so enjoy it and fly to the sun
Don't you return
Your breath and your heartbeat are gifts
You've been given for life - oh yeah

Oh our deepest emotions
Are a sign of our life and our love
No robot can stop us
Take my hand

Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand
We won't be so free
Until we rise again

...yeah...
