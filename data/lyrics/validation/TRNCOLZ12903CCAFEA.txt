Hey get your things it's time to go
You make me glad I'm not alone
In silence we hear the tires upon the road

I turned to you and asked you why
You're so awake you must be tired
You say when we're apart you'll close your eyes

This is beautiful
This is beautiful
Unmistakable
This is beautiful

We spent the day in central park
I wrote my name down on your arm
You set off avalanches in my heart

This is beautiful
This is beautiful
Unmistakable
This is beautiful

I never could have seen
Never could have seen this coming
The most amazing things
They arrive within a moment
I never could have seen
Never could have seen this coming on

I never could have seen, never could have seen this coming
You are here with me, I'm alive all of a sudden
Anyone can see, anyone can see it's beautiful

You set off avalanches in my heart (x4)

This is beautiful
This is beautiful
Unforgettable
This is beautiful
