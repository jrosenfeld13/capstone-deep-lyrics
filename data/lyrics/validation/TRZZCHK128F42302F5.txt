The moon was yellow, and the night was young
A smile brought us together, and I was wond'ring whether
We'd meet again someday
The moon was yellow, and a song was sung
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination

To give my heart away
Here we are! is our romance to continue?
Will it be my luck to win you
May I look that far? ah! my love is
Ah, my love is yellow and the night is young
