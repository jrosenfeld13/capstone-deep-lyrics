You never wanted this to last
You'd always rather feel bad
Who hurts most? is what you wonder
Who had the hardest day?
I have to ask you "What's your problem?"
I don't believe that you love anyone
? ? when you get hungry
'Cause you don't miss me
Lying by your side
I can feel your energy
And I want it to be mine...mine...mine
'Cause you don't talk like you used to do
You don't act like you used to
You don't laugh you to do
You don't seem to want to
Give me your engery
Give it to me
I want your energy
Give it to me
Me me me
You always thought that you don't like you
Well I do
I ????
Lying by your side
I can feel energy
And I want it be mine...mine...mine
'Cause you don't talk like you used to do
You don't act like you used
And you don't laugh like you used to do
And you don't seem to want to
Give me your engery
Give it to me
I want your energy
You in me
I want your energy
Give it to me
I want your energy
Give it to me
