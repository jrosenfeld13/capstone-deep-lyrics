Lets hear another song
About the girl whos seen it all
She was seventeen comin up on eighty
Let me tell you from the start
Im gonna try to do my part
But this big old world does nothing but escape me
With parting gifts and childish fits
My rubber soul is made of this
The comfort of my childhood bliss
Have made me cover up the dull inside
Become the apple of an eye
Im gasping at the sight of eyes adoring me
