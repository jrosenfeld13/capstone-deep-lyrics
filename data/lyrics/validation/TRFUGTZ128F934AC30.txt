She's acting like a woman
And you can tell by the look in her eyes
She's still a child
And she tells me
She's gonna go far her own way
And you know, yes you know
It's just a game she plays

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you

Search for what you need
Hunger for the feed
If you crash you soon will burn
Never to return

I couldn't see
My eyes were blinded
Now you're a picture of the past
A cold reminder

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you

Search for what you need
Hunger for the feed
If you crash you soon will burn
Never to return

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you
Yeah, you're killing me babe
