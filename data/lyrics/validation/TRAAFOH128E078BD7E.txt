I am betrayed, all is lost in me
Feeling cheated, my pain so overwhelming

Can't you see, that you're dead to me?
Don't you feel the pain inside of me?

How have we
Come this far?
How have I
Failed to see?

I am sold, the world is lost in me
Feeling no more, the numbness overtaking

I am cold, draining the life from me
Feeling so lost, is this the end of me?

How have you
Made it this far?
How have I
Been so blind?

How have I
Come this far?
Why do I
Feel this weak?
Can this be
The end of me?
The end of everything?
