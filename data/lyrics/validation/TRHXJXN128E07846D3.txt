Talk of the weekend, slow down
And maybe it's that I should be so you can flow
Shapes take shapes
Talk of the deep end, slow down
You should break you've always got your fingers in your
Your mouth

No choice now but it's clear
Come on, deep end, slow down
Take a break, that you wanted in your
In your house

Lions, then the donkeys go by
Then daddy's robbing into your bed kid
Your vacant days

Did you ever fall down?
Did you ever calm down?
And to know still you cave in
And to know still you cave in

(All the way)
No choice now but it's clear

Talk of the weekend, slow down
Then maybe it's so I should leave so you can draw into shapes
Oh come on, deep end, slow down
One day these robbers woke up into your vacant
Your vacant days, days, days, days, days, days

(Talk of the weekend, talk of the weekend)
There's one, got no reply, no reply
One, there's no reply, no reply, no reply, no reply

No reply, no

Did you ever fall down?
Did you ever calm down?
And to know still you cave in
And to know still you cave in
