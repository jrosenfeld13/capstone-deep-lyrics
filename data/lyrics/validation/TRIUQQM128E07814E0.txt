I was working at the club in 1995
Sunday was the night that the gay club came alive
See I would carry ice
And the crowd was just so nice that my phobia drowned
While I was getting down
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
Gay night, it's alright, don't be uptight
See half way through the evening
I saw this women gleamin' from across the room
She was with some guys
But when they gave me the eyes
I knew she was just their friend
We went out all weekend
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
Gay night, it's alright, don't be uptight
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
Gay night, it's alright, don't be uptight
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
Gay night, it's alright, don't be uptight
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
I met the finest girl of my life, that night, at gay
Night
Gay night, it's alright, don't be uptight
