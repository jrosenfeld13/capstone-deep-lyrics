You and I've got something caught between our eyes
A figure of fun and a teller of lies
You and I need nothing more to taint our lives
Would I do it to you? Well, I'll do it this time
Well, I'd do it again if I could
I'd do it again if you told me I should
I'd do it again for you, my love
Follow me and I'll do it again
You and I feel nothing, we're anaesthetized
When you've got no shame you've got nothing to hide
Just one click of your heels and I'd lend you my soul
Would I do it for you? Well, I do what I'm told
Well, I'd do it again if I could
I'd do it again if you told me I should
I'd do it again for you, my love
Follow me and I'll do it again
Well, I'd do it again if I could
I'd do it again if you told me I should
I'd do it again if I could
I'd do it again if you told me I should
I'd do it again if I could
I'd do it again if you told me I should
I'd do it again if I could
