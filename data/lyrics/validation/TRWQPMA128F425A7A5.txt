DeVille

I feel like a stranger in my hometown
Nobody wants to change the place from around
Put your hands in your pockets and keep moving around
You'll get in trouble if you stand here too long

Those desperate days, those were desperate days
Somehow, somewhere, we'll make our desperate ways

People I used to know they have to lay low
Hung out with the wrong people and they all went wrong
You ain't so cool when you come on so strong
[ .. ]

Those desperate days, those were desperate days
Somehow, somewhere, we'll make our desperate ways

Those desperate days, those were desperate days
Somehow, somewhere, we'll make our desperate escape

.. 

Those desperate days, those were desperate days
Somehow, somewhere we'll make our desperate escape

Those desperate days, those were desperate days
Somehow, somewhere, we'll make our desperate escape
