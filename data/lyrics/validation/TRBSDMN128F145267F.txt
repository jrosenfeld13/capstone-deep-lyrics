[Verse 1]
You see the trouble with me
I've got a head full of fuck
I'm a basket case
I don't think I can love, love, love
You see the trouble with you
Is you're in love with me
What a strange thing to do
What a brave place to be

[Chorus 1]
So we dive on sunset strip
A heart so deep I drown in it
And as it breaks I swim through cracks
And leave with words I can't take back

[Verse 2]
You see the trouble with me
Monkey see monkey do
There's no you in tomorrow
A better offer came through
You see the trouble with you
There's no trouble with you
So when you say that you love me
That stops me loving you

[Chorus 2]
So she stays on sunset strip
A heart so full I drown in it
She's waiting for my words to break
The one true love I couldn't make

[Bridge]
Wo wo wo yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus 3]
So she walks that golden mile
Men will try and catch her eye
We both know what could have been
On sunset strip a broken dream
