[Verse 1]
You're sorry, said you want me back, one thing I'm asking you
You're staring in the mirror while it's staring back at you
You asked me why I'm leaving, going on the western wind
You know you're best believing, I won't be back again
Won't be back again

[Chorus]
You think I've turned to cheating, and you're looking for the proof
You can't handle the truth

[Verse 2]
Say your one last story, cause I'm headed out the door
I don't want to hear it, I've heard it all before
I'm giving up on loving you, you're the [?] done the same
Somehow you've convinced yourself that I'm the one to blame
I'm the one to blame

[Chorus]
You think I've turned to cheating, and you're looking for the proof
You can't handle the truth

[Verse 3]
Out all night running round, oh, to half past three
Take a long look at the shelf before you look at me
You think you've got a reason to even up the score
You better get acquainted with the slamming of the door
Slamming of the door

[Chorus]
You think I've turned to cheating, and you're looking for the proof
You can't handle the truth
