I am the soul of a nameless machine. I
Can only breathe, I can only breed, I can
Only bleed. Bleed out over her wishing
It was me

Its a joke played by God on you and me
A cruel act of divinity. Only dream of
Winters dead leaves. Falling from
Trees, falling on me. Hanging three
Feet from the Earth that I cant seem to
Leave. This hurts, this hurts. All I can
Do is dream of her. This hurts, this
Hurts. All I can do is bleed with her
This hurts

First Ill slit your throat and let you
Bleed out. Then Ill use a knife to carve
Your eyes out.(2x)

Everyone missing our last laugh, just
Broken hearts and shattered glass
Just two ghosts from the past
Screaming love songs. Hung by your
Words, they wore me down. Im swimming
Out to sea and I dont want to be found

Which one of you?
Tried to save me
Which one of you?
Tried to stop me
Which one of you?
Which one of you?

I am the soul of a nameless machine. I
Can only breathe, I can only breed, I can
Only bleed. Bleed out over her wishing
It was me

Its a joke played by God on you and me
A cruel act of divinity. Only dream of
Winters dead leaves. Falling from
Trees, falling on me. Hanging three
Feet from the Earth that I cant seem to
Leave. This hurts, this hurts. All I can
Do is dream of her
