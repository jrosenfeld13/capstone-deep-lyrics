Living
Running
Out on the streets at night
Searching
Hoping
For the right connection, 'cause'
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have it
Takes me higher than anything I know
Angel Dust
Need a shot to see me through the day
Angel Dust
Want a lot I've got to get away
I live my life
Like there's no tomorrow
Take no
Chances
I'm drowning all my sorrows 'cause' I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have it
Takes me higher than anything I know
Laughing
Crying
Every night and day
I know
You know
That I'm a different man because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have it
Takes me higher than anything I know
