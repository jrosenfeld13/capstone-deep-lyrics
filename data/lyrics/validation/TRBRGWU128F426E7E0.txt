The telephone is ringing, disconnect the line
The tension is building but I'm alright
The stars are colliding
So you might as well, oh might as well
Let me go

The television is burning, I set it on fire
The wheels, they keep turning, but I'm fine, yeah I'm fine
What about the questions we have
Locked up inside?

Somewhere, somehow
We've been denied
Hand in hand we walk, blind
Pretending, defending while our souls are tied

It's only the third hour, my conscience subsides
But something will remind me that you lied, yeah you lied
What about the consequences?
This can't be right

Somewhere, somehow
We've been denied
Hand in hand we walk, blind
Pretending, defending while our souls are tied
