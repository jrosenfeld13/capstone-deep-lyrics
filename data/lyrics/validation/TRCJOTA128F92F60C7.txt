Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Yeah, yeah

Why do birds suddenly appear
Everytime you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by? oh
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
(Yeah, ooh)
Ooh yeah

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
Yes they did
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And starlight in your eyes, like they do
(Like they do)
Do

That is why
(That is why)
All the guys in town
(All of the guys)
Follow you, all around
(Ooh yeah)
Just, just, just, just, just like me
They long, they long to be, close to you baby
(Close to you, ooh yeah )
Ooh baby

If only for a minute
(Closer)
I'd settle for an hour
(Closer)
And if you could stay, just for one day
That would make me so happy, happy baby

See it won't hurt to give our love a try
(So no)
Girl don't you pass me by
'Cuz I'm that kind of guy
(Closer)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who's gonna love and treat you like a Queen
(Gonna love)
(Ooh)
Hmm

That is why all the girls in town
(They don't mean nothin' baby)
Follow you all around
(I only have best for you, girl)
Just like me
(Just like me)
They long to be
Close to you
(Close to you)

I can feel it whenever
We touchin' whenever
We talkin' whenever we want
(Together)
All the time
(Together)
Ooh
(Close to you)
I wanna be, I wanna be, hoo
(I wanna be, hoo)

Come a little closer baby
(Come a little closer baby)
Lay your head upon my shoulder baby
(Upon my shoulder babe)
Boy you know I can't deny it
(Girl you know I can't deny it)
You done, gonna set my soul on fire, baby
(Hmm, I would like to be closer to you, baby)
Oh, I can't believe that
(I can't believe it)
We're huggin' and kissin'
An' squeezin' each other
An' I don't want to
Get close to you
