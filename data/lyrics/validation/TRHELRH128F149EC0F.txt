I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you
(I said) I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you

Permission to speak
The time we have is running out
There's a fire in my heart
And I don't wanna put it out

Because I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, all night long

My resistance is weak
There ain't a day that goes around
You're making me crazy
You pick me up and you pull me down

I said I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, in my arms
I said I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, all night long

I've been wishing on
Holding you so long
Every day of the week
I've been losing sleep
What's the matter with you
Ain't I good enough to
Hold you when I wanna?
Hold you when I want to?

I said, please baby please, ah-ooh
Rock me in your lovin' arms
Won't you give me one chance?
I don't know what I'd do without you

I said I just wanna hold, oh-oh oh
I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, hold you, hold you

I said I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, in my arms
I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, (hold you, hold you) all night long

I just wanna hold, yeah
I just wanna hold you, hold you, hold you
I said I just wanna hold
I just wanna hold you, (yeah-eah-eah-eah aah-aah) hold you, hold you

I just wanna hold, yeah-eah-eah-eah aah-aah
I just wanna hold you, all night long
