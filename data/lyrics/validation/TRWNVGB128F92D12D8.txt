You're worth something special
You're worth something real
You're worth something special
Something real, use it up and wear it out
Not much left to care about work full time to shake the doubts
You should call time out
Running up and down the block
Hiding from a passive shock
Easy if you talk the talk
If you walk the walk

Make believe around the clock
Play your part until you drop
Easy if you talk the talk
If you walk the walk
You're worth something special
You're worth something real
You're worth something special something real...
