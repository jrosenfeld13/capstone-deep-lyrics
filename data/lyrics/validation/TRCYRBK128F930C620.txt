I know that everyone's runnin'
Just tryin' to get away
Life can feel a lot like a rat race
Like everyday is so mundane, but I am sayin'

Hey, hey, oh, oh
I'm not gettin' caught in the undertow
I'll keep takin' it easy and takin' it slow
I'm never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll

Why don't you come on and join us?
Take your nose off the grindstone, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take, take your hands off the keyboard
And put down the iPhone and let me hear you say

Hey, hey, oh, oh
We ain't gettin' caught in the undertow
We'll keep takin' it easy and takin' it slow
We're never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll
That's how we roll

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll

Don't fold under the pressure
A smile can make it better
Whoa, you know, you know, yeah

Don't fold under the pressure
A smile can make it better
And if everythin' goes wrong
Keep singin' this song

Turn it up, make it loud
You, you can't get away
Yeah, don't, don't try to get away

Turn it up, make it loud
You, you can't get away
Yeah, don't, don't try to get away, oh no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll
That's how we roll

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll
That's how we roll

Gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows that's how we roll
