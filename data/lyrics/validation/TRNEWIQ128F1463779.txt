Jeffrey drew a circle but no one wanted to know
So Jeffrey lit a candle and then began to blow

Progress was no excuse, pleasure was there none
And lights went out along the coast as Jeffrey lost and won

Oh, open your minds to Jeffrey
Hoist another flag, hoist another flag
And do it again for Jeffrey
Fill another bag, fill another bag

Laughter filled the churches as he walked amongst their eyes
He shouted out for freedom and tried to drown their lies

Oh, open your minds to Jeffrey
Hoist another flag, hoist another flag
And do it again for Jeffrey
Fill another bag, fill another bag

Jeffrey will be there, everywhere
He will come to your place

You may have heard the stories how he changed all the words
But time is a great healer, of that I'm sure you've heard

Yes, open your minds to Jeffrey
Hoist another flag, hoist another flag
And do it again for Jeffrey
Fill another bag, fill another bag
