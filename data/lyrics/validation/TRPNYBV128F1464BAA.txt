Look how beautiful this world
Black and white forever
It's all simple, yeah, I know
I've been sitting here a while
Like to know things better
No emotions in my mind

But you discover me
There is no perfection
And love is always blind
Perhaps you're not aware
That TV's keep lying
You can't have all of that

And I can't do a thing
'Cos I'm driven every time
You needn't try your best
You're the same way as I am

There's something I should say
But my head is empty
And I am lost again
I feel I have no will
Frankly, I'm exhausted
It's not been a good day

And I can't do a thing
'Cos I'm driven every time
You needn't try your best
You're the same way as I am
