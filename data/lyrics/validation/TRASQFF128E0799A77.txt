And if we go to Mexico
Will it get better?
And all the cracks inside this love
Will they heal in the bright weather
I think it's time to have a go
Before I met her I was low
And she saved me
All the stupid little crimes
A thousand million different times
And she forgave me
Promise me this will get better
And it will heal in the bright weather
And as long as were together
I don't mind'

And if we go to Mexico
Will it be a new leaf?
We'll watch the evening disappear
Into the arms of the night thief
Beside a river of sin
I was trying to dive in
And she saved me
Forgetting to remember
One day in December
And she forgave me
Promise me this will get better
And it will heal in the bright weather
And as long as were together
I don't mind
La la la la la la
I don't mindl
A la la la la la
I don't mind
And if we go to Mexico..
