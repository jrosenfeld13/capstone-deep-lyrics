Another day
I cannot stop another day
Take me away
I've got to get away
Another day
I cannot stop another day
Take me away
I've got to get away
Shake this up, one two ........
I got to know how....... you wanna be free
If you got a hurt on your mind and you wanna tell
Come on join let's talk, come on and break the spell
And now, I know, I know what you did
Nothing yeah, who can .........
I do now know, I know what I've done
I'm can't blame you for taking the run
So I'm watching, I'm watching here again
I watch you as a lover, I don't watch you as a friend
So back this I got to get ..........
Love's a ship I gotta get ..........
Could I go back, could I turn back time
Then I wanna come with a lovely rhyme
Got you going on gotta I take my way
Cause I keep going on for another day
You gotta take me away, take me away
Take me away
You gotta take me away, take me away
Take me away
Slappin in the face, I don't give a damn
Come back now to me, I wanna be your man
Cause I know that I wanna give it to you
I love you baby, you know you want it to yo
Deep inside, deep deep in my heart
Got a pain, got a pain, carry me upon
All I want you to ............will see
But I've got wait for, for another day
