[Hook]
They said it couldn't be done, they said I shouldn't pursue
They said I'm doing it wrong, they said I need a new view
They said "You can't get there from here."
I said, "Tell someone who cares."

[Verse One]
I used to be embarrassed by my nasal delivery
In fact I almost let the critics get the best of me
But they day I stop writing rhymes, stick to making beats
Is the day I sample, Between The Sheets by The Isley Brothers
And hook it up with Impeach The President
It won't happen
Got no time for hesitance
Because I don't have major labels knocking at my door
If I'm not having fun, what am I here for?
I don't talk shit just to make you believe it
It's called "freedom of choice" you can take it or leave it
I'm an acquired taste worth a second listen every night
They say I sound white, guess what, I am white
It's just a fact and I won't play apologetic
Cause I think the way that some kids act is just pathetic
Interrupt a stage show to ask for an open mic is shameless
Plus it will never make you famous
When I'm not rocking mics or blowing up message boards
I'm listening to demos I get sent, unless it's yours
In which case
I refer you to song about a walkman I rocked with my man John Smith
And yes, for the record
I entered a battle once
I won then retired and now I'm the celebrity judge
It may sound like my ego's in overdrive
I'm just trying to let you in on how I'm staying alive
My songs are not a measure of vanity
It's just one of the few ways I got to fight the insanity
And withstand the new wave and prove to you
That I have nothing to prove to you

[Hook]
They said it couldn't be done, they said I shouldn't pursue
They said I'm doing it wrong, they said I need a new view
They said "You can't get there from here."
I said, "Tell someone who cares."
They said I don't have the voice, that I should only produce
They said to hang up the mic, they said that I don't have the juice
They said, "You can't get there from here."
I said, "Tell someone who cares."
