I won't tell you my name
I avoid all those things
All together
I'm so high

Well I know it was dumb
Staring right at the sun
Stoned forever

Well it won't be the first or the last time
The world passes by

I'm a spaceboy
I don't want to be found
I'm a spaceboy
So stop holding me down
And I'd love
If I never returned to the ground

Well can we still be friends?
Well I guess that depends
How's the weather
From so high?

Well I know it's a shame
Why do you cause all this strain
All together

Well it won't be the first or the last
Time I wanted to try

I'm a spaceboy
I don't want to look down
I'm a spaceboy
I've been floating around

And I'd love
If I never returned to the ground
I can see all the world going by

I'm a spaceboy
I don't want to be found
I'm a killjoy
So stop dragging me down
And I'd love
If I never returned to the ground
