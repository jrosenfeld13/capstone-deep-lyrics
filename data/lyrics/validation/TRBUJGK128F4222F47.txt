There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy
And sad of eye
But very wise
Very wise was he

Then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while he spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is to love
And be loved in return

(Scat)
