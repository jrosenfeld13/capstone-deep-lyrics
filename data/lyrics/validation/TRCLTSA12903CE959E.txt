The sunset through the blinds reminds me of the time we met
You were like a ray of sunlight penetrating my apartment
As we walked down by the water I remember what you said
You said, "We had so much in common." You didn't see it coming

Oh I was as surprised to find the love inside your eyes
As you were, to see mine
And our friends all laughed and we were warned
It was the calm before the storm, that comes
Like it always does, like it always does

Love of mine, Oh my, how we have grown
We're different now
Don't ever want to go back to being alone
It's different now
And I wouldn't change a thing

I recall the times we spent down by the coffee shop
We would fight and you would cry, because in those days I lied a lot
Tried to protect you from the truth, I had to learn that never worked
I couldn't anything from you, couldn't bare to see it hurt you

Oh I was so surprised to find forgiveness in your eyes
Undeserved. But love is blind
So we shared our hearts as we drove home
It was the calm before the storm, that comes

Like it always does

Love of mine, Oh my, how we have grown
We're different now
Don't ever want to go back to being alone
It's different now
And I wouldn't change a thing

After all the mistakes
Different now
It seems our love never brakes
Different now
And I wouldn't change a thing

Love of mine, Oh my, how we have grown
We're different now
Don't ever want to go back to being alone
It's different now
And I wouldn't change, I wouldn't change a thing

The sunset through the blinds reminds me of the time we met
You were like a ray of sunlight penetrating my apartment
