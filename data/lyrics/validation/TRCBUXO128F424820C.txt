He's in love with a little white god he said
So in love he'll take it in the arm instead
Happy solomn sombre and demure
Are the words that miss a point and a cure
He's in love with a little brown god he said
I have seen the little beads on his forehead
He'll watch the world go round from another place
There's nothing wrong with this
It doesn't affect any heads
He's in love with the rotten old world
He's so in love he'll take it in the arm of his girl
He's in love with a little white god
He's so in love he's forgotten about being a mod
We can't live by laws watchmaking
We can't live like whores babes and children
We can live 'lord of the flies' it's indicative
We can live by we can live buy
Well he's in love and destructively demonstrative
To himself and you and the world inside
When he should kick against the mind manager
It's tunnel vision in a furry colour techni
It's the ultimate not pick-up truck
There's nothing wrong with this
It doesn't affect any heads
He's so in love with a very sad soul
He's so in love you wouldn't believe he was once good in goal
He's so in souled with a little brown god
He doesn't trust himself in fact he just doesn't trust
We can't live by laws watchmaking
We can't live like whores babes and children
We can live 'lord of the flies' it's indicative
We can live by we can live buy
Not me........
He's in love with a little known world
He's so in love he'll take it in the arm of his girl
He's so in love with a little white god
He's so in love he's forgotten about being a mod
We can't live by laws watchmaking
We can't live like whores babes and children
We can live 'lord of the flies' it's indicative
We can live by we can live buy
We can live...
Not me we can live life not me we can live by not me we can live by
