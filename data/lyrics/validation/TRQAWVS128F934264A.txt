I had a little too much to drink last night
And I burned up the dinette set
And then me and Tammy had a horrible fight
About me getting us in debt

She locked me out so I could sleep with the dog
And she poured out all of my booze
Later on I heard her sawing logs
While me and Fluffy sang the blues

Well, I'm a moron (he's a moron)
I'm a dummy (he's a dummy)
I'm an irresponsible wash out
And a debit to my gender
I spent too much time in bars
I let the arsehole go too far
And that's why Tammy has my car

Lately I've had time on my hands
Since I quit that pizza place
Seems I'm better with my liver than my other glands
And the ground's best friend it my face

Lately I'm drinking out of a bag
Since Tammy hooked up with that singer
And every now and then they pass me in my jag
And they both throw me the finger

Well, I'm a moron (he's a moron)
I'm a dummy (he's a dummy)
I'm an irresponsible wash out
And a debit to my gender
I spent too much time in bars
I let the arsehole go too far
And that's why Tammy has my car

I'm a moron (he's a moron)
I'm a dumb arse (he's a dumb arse)
I'm an irresponsible wash out
And a debit to my gender
Now I'll sleep beneath the stars
And her lawyer's the head of the bar
Anyway, that's why Tammy has my car

Now I'll sleep beneath the stars
And her lawyer's the head of the bar
That's why some singer has my car
