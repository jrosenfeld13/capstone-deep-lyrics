[Verse 1]
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Verse 2]
And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Bridge]
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
