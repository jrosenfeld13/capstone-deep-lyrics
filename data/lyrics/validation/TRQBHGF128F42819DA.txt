And I'm just trying to
Get through to you
But there's no getting through a door
And I'm just hoping too
Break on through to you
Hope your door won't mind me hoping

You're gonna need somebody on your side
You're gonna need somebody on your side

You're only self assured with your liquor lips and slurring words
The line is clear, the point is blurred
And I'm just hoping that you can shut your eyes and see for miles
Cos when they're opened they're so frightened

You're gonna need somebody on your side
You're gonna need somebody on your side
You're gonna need somebody on your side
It's a lonely time otherwise

You can tell by her lips she's good to kiss
But her eyes she's good to talk too
But there's a ringing there's a buzzing in her ear
She can't drink people stare her way

And I'm just trying to
Get through to you but
There's no getting through sometimes

And I'm just hoping too
Break on through to you
Hope your door won't mind me hoping

You're gonna need somebody on your side
You're gonna need somebody on your side
You're gonna need somebody on your side

It's a wasted life
It a lonely time otherwise
