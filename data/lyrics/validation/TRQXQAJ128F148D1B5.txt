Say something for the record, tell the people what you feel
Fuck the record, and fuck the people

Snot
We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fatter sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it

[Verse 1]
Can you slow down?
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town
Break It
Smash It
Motherfuckin'

[Hook]
Snot
We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fattest sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it

[Verse 1]
Can you slow down?
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B.)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town

Clockin' all them girls

[Bridge]
Well Snot
I've got to tell you once again
Don't try and play my crew cause you just can't win
I like to hear the sound when your skull cracks
If you talk back feel us attack yall
We're fixin' to take you down with a fat, funky sound
Gonna steal your crown
Not gonna mess around
I know you hear my voice cause you got no choice
The volume of my crew still undisputed
If you don't move
We're gonna roll right over motherfucker
Down with this crew
Yes everything's gonna be alright
I've got to wow the crowd with a sound so loud
Try and front but you know I'm gonna get down
I've got the mic that's right what's at stake is
Afraid you'll hear the truth
You can't take this

[Verse 1]
Slow down
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B.)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town

[Hook]
Yeah Snot
We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fattest sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it

Break It
