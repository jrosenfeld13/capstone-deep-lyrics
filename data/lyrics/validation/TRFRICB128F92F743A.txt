How did we lose this great wrath
Everything burns in our path
The balance we broke
Left us running through smoke
You're at the blue light of the flame

As the earth melts at the poles
I race to man the controls
And I work harder, fiercer and smarter
You're at the blue light of the flame

So this is where it all ends
With the flowers by your bed
And your friends come to you
As the light turns to dark
But the light shines through

Yes when the hurricanes came
We were the gods that we blamed
We have orange-red fire
We fear our desire
You kneel at the blue light of the flame

Out beyond rescue
Somebody let you
Look into the blue light of the flame
