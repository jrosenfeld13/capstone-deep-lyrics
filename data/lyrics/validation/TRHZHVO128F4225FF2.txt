Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so good No one could be, so gentle and so lovable Oh, my pa-pa, he always understood. Gone are the days when he could take me on his knee And with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter Oh, my pa-pa, so funny, so adorable Always the clown so funny in his way Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful Deep in my heart I miss him so today

Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful
Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so good
No one could be, so gentle and so lovable
Oh, my pa-pa, he always understood
Gone are the days when he could take me on his knee
And with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter
Oh, my pa-pa, so funny, so adorable
Always the clown so funny in his way
Oh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful
Deep in my heart I miss him so today
