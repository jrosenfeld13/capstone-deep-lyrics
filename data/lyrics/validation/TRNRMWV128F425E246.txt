Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard
What won't kill you will make you strong
Sing, my sister, sing

You don't need to disrespect yourself again
Don't hide your light behind your fear
Now women can be strong
You've known it all along
What you need is what you haven't found
So

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard
What won't kill you will make you strong
Sing, my sister, sing

Women are the mothers of the world, my friend
I tell you womankind is strong
Take your beautiful self up to the heights again
(Ooh)
Back to the place where you belong
So

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard
What won't kill you will make you strong
Sing, my sister, sing

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard
What won't kill you will make you strong
Sing, my sister, sing

Sing out
Sing loud
Sing proud

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard

Sing, my sister, sing
Let your voice be heard
