Well my mama she didn't 'low me
Just to stay out all night long, oh Lord
Well my mama didn't 'low me
Just to stay out all night long
I didn't care what she didn't 'low
I would boogie-woogie anyhow

When I first came to town people
I was walkin' down Hastings Street
Everybody was talkin' about the Henry Swing Club
I decided I drop in there that night
When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"
They was really havin' a ball!
Yes, I know
Boogie Chillin

One night I was layin' down
I heard mama 'n papa talkin'
I heard papa tell mama
Let that boy boogie-woogie
It's in him, and it got to come out
And I felt so good
Went on boogie'n just the same
