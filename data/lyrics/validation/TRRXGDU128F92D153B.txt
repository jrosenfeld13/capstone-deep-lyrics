The comforting ache
Of the summer holidays
Pointless days pining
Afternoons whining
The suburbs scream
At passers by
They scream of escape
A mute siren

In wasted light
Hope takes flight

I dont mind losing self-respect
Ive done it before and Ill do it again
Im stifled tonight, which is fine
Ive done it before and Ill do it again

Billboards evanesce
Under regular beams of light
Toothpaste smiles
Dont seem so bright

Homogenize!
Dont revise!
I dont mind losing self-respect
Ive done it before and Ill do it again
Im thwarted tonight, which is fine
You see Ive done it before and Ill do it again

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
