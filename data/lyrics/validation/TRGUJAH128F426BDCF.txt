I am the jury you're goin' to hell
Bein' penalized for the shit you sell
Spray your face with a thousand bullets
Because the judge wants me to pull it
Time for the payback I don't care
Walkin' tall even combed my hair
All you fuckers just ain't aware
Spent 25 years delivering mail

All my neighbors knew my name
My one and only claim to fame
I got fired and I don't know why
Look in my eyes prepare to die
My wife don't wanna know me no more
Can't feed my kids I'm out the door
Seein' as I don't wanna live no more
Now I'm comin' to even the score
