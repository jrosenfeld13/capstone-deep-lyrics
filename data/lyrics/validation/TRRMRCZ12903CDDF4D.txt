So this is where I hurt
You know I won't make it
I won't make it

And every day it hurts
You know I can't break it
I won't break it

I never want to know
What you mean to me, to me
And all I need to know, I need to know
That you are here with me, with me, with me

Consider where I hurt
You know your love breaks me
Your love breaks me
And I won't make you hurt
You know I can't break it
I won't break it

I never want to know
What you mean to me, to me
And all I need to know, I need to know
That you are here with me, with me, with me

I never want to know
What you mean to me, to me
And all I need to know, I need to know
That you are here with me, with me
And all I need to know, I need to know
That you are here with me, with me
And all I need to know, I need to know
That you are here with me, with me, with me
