Are you feeling zip-zip? Are you ready for partying?
I need your field trip slip signed by a parent or guardian
But I understand if they don't want to sign it because most people find
Vulture Shark's Sculpture Park a little bit dangerous... Culture, hark!

There's Bunny Loafabread on a Sofabed
And Igloo Turtle leaps a big blue hurdle overhead
Lil Orphan Dolphin gets endorphins from golfing
She's looking lucky and reckless
Thanks to her Tumbleweed/Bumblebead Necklace

Let's watch a newborn gorilla dip a blue corn torilla chip.
There's Hamstergram to Amsterdam
With a robo-action-al hobo satchel perched on an ampersand
Don Quixote with a Calder 'stache is riding Donkey Odie

A sign says, "Don't Touch."
Balderdash! As if the oil on my skin could mess up an outdoor steel statue

What a bucolic setting
A whole house made of bedding
It's getting cold out. Oh wow, a wedding
The groom wore a costume, a very goth towel, a terrycloth cowl
He said, "I, Hairy Moth Owl, take you to bite off my head all the time
To lavish and mould me in quickness and stealth till death or we part
And you?"
The bride, a turtledove, replied
"You may kiss the fertile love inside
My girdle/glove divide."

Vulture Shark presided as host and proposed a toast:
He said, "Make your woman a momma, damn it
And spread more seeds on the planet than a pomegranate."
He'd copped her a Lepidoptera Helicopter,
A Dubuffet table with butter frogs and mice
A chopped liver goose, and Lincoln Logs of ice
I said, "Beg pardon
I brought the happy couple a Caterpillar Egg Carton."

We had our fill of turkey sandwiches made from traced hands
On butcher paper tablecloths with glasses of crayons

Marriage isn't an indivigin decision
I ran over a bridge and
Explored the park store run by Rebecca Pidgeon
Selling tight terrific sight specific environments;
Vulture Park Sculpture Park as depicted by Barman's Garments.
