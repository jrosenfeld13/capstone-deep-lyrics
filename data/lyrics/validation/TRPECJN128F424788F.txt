The great Persian serpent lies in wait
Let us face his army of immortals
We shall butcher those hunters of men's souls
And crush their nimbus of immortality
An anabis against the son of Darius
Whose slave-army arrived on the beaches of Thermopylae
To extort earth and water
And treat us with perversity and death
Wretched is their Persian culture of shame and triviality
We shall never bow for the self-proclaimed Demigod
Let us butcher the legions of slaves and sorcerers
Wave after wave will shatter on our shields
Their steps slower, their breaths quicker
Detracted their morale, pile the dead high!
Our spears and swords shall pierce their armour
Cut their carotids! Break their spirits!
Down with the God-King Xerxes

A beast is approaching us
Its magnitude will blot out the son
We shall drink Persian blood
And find our glory in the final arrow hail
We blaspheme the tyrant
Earth and water
Under the banner of Hercules
For the eternal glory of Sparta
Death to the Persian invaders!

"300 is a United States attempt to humiliate Iran in order to compensate for its wrongdoings in order to provoke American soldiers and warmongers."
(Javad Shamghadri, cultural adviser to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad)

"300 is serving the policy of the US leadership and predicted it will prompt a wave of protest in the world... Iranians living in the U.S. and Europe will not be indifferent about this obvious insult."
(Hamshahri - Iran's biggest circulation newspaper)
