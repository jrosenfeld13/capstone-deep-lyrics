O fraudulent mirror, O rank rainbow toad
I'd break apart too, if I knowed what you knowed
I'd fall from the wall, I'd leap from the road
You take cover in the clover, you don't shoulder the load

Wagner and wife, drama and strife
Their syphilitic friend Dionysus is wise not to ask "Where's Sunstroke House?"
Where's a crow on the far fence?
Where's a mill by the pond?

Pale with horror I saw you when your bird flew
Now who in the whole low world has been kind to you
Save for a kindly, ugly few?
Don't read it, don't watch it, don't do what they do

From the wind in the Winter, no mercy, no quarter
From the Summer no mercy, and little goes well
That's where you'll live, that's where you'll live
Till a gale rips ya sail, till a will kills ya mill...

Where have you been, my heat, my shadow?
How well did you like the song?
I filled it so full of nonsense and unrule
You feel like there's something forgotten or fell

Pale with horror I saw you when your bird flew
Now who in the whole low world has been kind to you
Save for a kindly, ugly few?
Don't read it, don't watch it, don't do what they do

Pink lipped bub, golden haired sitting
Portraits of withering roots -
Pretty diversions, pointless excursions, pleasant distractions
Underground mutes
