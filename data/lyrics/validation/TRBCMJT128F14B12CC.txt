I taste you much better
Off teeth taste
Of white skin on red leather
Check the claws we got

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, work your pitch

I came to in feathers
Like leaves
And you rubbed me together
With claws like we got

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, work your pitch
Daytime, Dancer, I'll come inside
Got my, teacher, now carve your niche

Check the claws

It's your
It's yours
Your turn to come inside

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, work your pitch
Daytime, Dancer, I'll come inside
Got my, teacher, carve your (niche)
