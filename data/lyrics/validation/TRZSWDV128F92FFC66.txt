How does it feel to be alone?
I see inside your eyes
You wanna be here with me and my own
See inside your eyes

It's 'cause my lie is the truth
That's fine we never know
The truth is what I'm after
And I know the sign I'm searching for won't show

And I sing about what I dream about
And my dream's loving you tonight
And I have no doubt the words that I shout
And scream so loudly late at night

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different

Like I have been kicked in the chest
And I know you never cared because you're just like all the rest

Baby I sing about what I dream about
And my dream's loving you tonight
And I have no doubt the words that I shout
And scream so loudly late at night

Do you believe all those lies that she told you?
Late at night when she told you she loved you, she lied

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different

Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Why don't you?
Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Why don't you?

Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Why don't you?
Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Why don't you?
Come on, come on, won't you get close to me?
Why don't you?

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different

I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Baby, ooh you're different
