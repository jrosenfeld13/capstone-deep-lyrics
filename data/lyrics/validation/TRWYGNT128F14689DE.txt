Sometimes I wish I was a sailor
Way out on the stormy sea
Far away from the city and all this misery
And I wish that I could tell you just how much you mean to me
No matter where I run to
I'll never lose your memory

Sometimes I close my eyes and drift away
I can't forget the things I didn't say
I chose a life that took me away from you
And I will be forever blue

When you wake up in tomorrow and I'm no longer by your side
Just don't think too much about me and of the many times you've cried
And wherever you may wander may good fortune be your guide
Go find another lover, one who'll never leave your side

Sometime I close my eyes and drift away...

I chose a life that took me away from you, and I will be forever blue
