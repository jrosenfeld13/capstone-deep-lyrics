Lying on your floor
Lighting matches to stay warm
Closing all the blinds
And getting up to lock the door
Lying to your friends
Burning bridges once again
Guess some things
Just never end
You're still around
In spite of them
Bad penny don't you know
Don't you know
You'll lose your soul

I wish you wouldn't start
It makes forgiveness twice as
Hard
Trying to let go
While making sure
That you get home
After all the bars have closed
After all it's getting cold
My stupid heart won't let go
I'll fall asleep on your floor

Shooting with the stars
Sound asleep, junk in cars
Hanging with the friends that
You met down at the wrecking
Yard

Oh, I say you'll probably
Sell it all before you leave
Your soul and your dignity
As you're getting what you need
