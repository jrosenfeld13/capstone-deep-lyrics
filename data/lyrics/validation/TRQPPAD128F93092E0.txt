Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing

I might forget what city I'm in
Might have a mistress and a girlfriend
Girlfriend would find out and let me go
Then I'd be lost and end up alone

I'm just a wayward son of a preacher
You are a queen that's how I should treat you
Lessons in love, you are my teacher
My teacher you are

And I do it for love and I do it for good
'Cause you gave me your heart like I knew that you would
And you bring out the best and I hope that you know
So I gotta confess, listen

Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't even have a answer
Would need a doctor so I can treat her like a cancer
Give me the medicine, I'mma put it through my arm slow
Listen to Whitney she singing where do broken hearts go

Do they go, do they go, where they go, baby?
Nobody knows where do the broken hearts go
Where do they go, do they go, where they go, baby?
Nobody knows

And I do it for love and I do it for good
'Cause you gave me your heart like I knew that you would
And you bring out the best and I hope that you know
So I gotta confess, listen

Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing

I'd be nothing
I'd be just an empty shell looking for you
I'd be washed up on the shore
While the wind whips on me bay

And if you could understand
I would be just half a man
Without you I would be nothing
Without you

Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, nothing
