Well you know I have not a day to loose
If I think to stay and try to change the world
If Im feeling down I just have to wait
The time when you come could make everything change
You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing

Buildings that have made just to be destroyed
Roses have grown to dead on the flower base
As I feel the end of some little things
I can feel the time bringing more happiness

You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing

Goodbye to the things that I left behind
Welcome to the world younger now than before
If Im feeling down I just have to wait
The time when you come could make everything change

You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing
You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing

Lets change the world
You close to me
Youve changed my mind
Thats reality
Lets change the world
Lets move our feet
Lets find the love for the eternity ...

Goodbye to the things that I left behind
Welcome to the world younger now than before
If Im feeling down I just have to wait
The time when you come could make everything change

You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing
You know youre the reason why I feel so fine
cause youre my beautiful thing

Goodbye to the things that I left behind
Welcome to the world younger now than before
Goodbye to the things that I left behind
Welcome to the world younger now than before
