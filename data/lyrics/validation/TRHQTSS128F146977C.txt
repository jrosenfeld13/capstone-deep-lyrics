These are dangerous times
That were living in
And there are dangerous signs
That were giving in to fear
Late one night, I'm lying here
I thought I heard a sound

Tell the mothers and the babes
Tell the old, tell the sick they will be safe
Get the young males. Tell them to be brave
I was so concerned with saving live
I never saw you pull the knife

High on the mountains
Across seven seas
All of the people
Why me, why me?
Do you feel so frustrated
Frightened and feared
Answer my question
Why me, why me, why me
Why me, why me, why me?

You're such an angry young man
With all your grievances
People don't understand
They just can't understand
What you must do to stay alive

So you try to justify
All the violence and hate, before your eyes
Through the ages better men than you have tried
To give what is not theirs to give
To take the land where others live

High on the mountains
Across seven seas
All of the people why me, why me?
Do you feel so frustrated
Frightened and feared
Answer my question
Why here, why now
Why here, why now, hey here
Why now, why me?

Oh, for now you have the power
The guns and all the swords
But nature has a nasty habit
Of balancing her flaws

Now you may try to break my body
Lock me up and throw away the key
But you'll never break my spirit
I'm free!
