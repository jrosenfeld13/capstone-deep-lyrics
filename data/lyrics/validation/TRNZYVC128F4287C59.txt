If you see Charlie James comin' down the road
Say you, please don't tell him which a-way you see me go
In the mornin' soon, in the mornin' soon
Yes, I'm goin' back to Houston1 in the mornin' soon
Had a whole lotta money one day, one day
Next day I didn't have a dime
Look down the road just as far as I could see
And I thought I spied my old-time used-to-be
In a whole lot of trouble one day, one day
Next day I didn't know what to do
Look down the road just as far as I could see
And I thought I spied my old-time used-to-be
When a man gets in trouble, everybody throws him down
A killing for his friends and they won't come around
Nobody ever knows you when you're down and out
Ask 'em for a favor, they don't know what's all about
Well, you may go, you may try to stay
But you'll be back some old rainy day
