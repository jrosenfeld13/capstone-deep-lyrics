Baby what am i gonna do?
Baby what am i gonna do with you?
With you

Well now i should say about the girl that took my love away
How she left me all alone
I don't wanna call my own home

Baby what am i gonna do?
Baby what am i gonna do with you?
With you

She had everything
Oh for my love to be
Oh, but all she ever wanted was to be set free

Baby what am i gonna do?
Baby what am i gonna do with you?
With you

Wll just what do i have to do
To get your sweet loving from you?
Do i have to die once or twice
To keep it for the rest, the rest of my life?
All of my life

If you were 17, i'd still feel the same way
Oh, there's nothing in this world
That could make me change my ways

Baby what am i gonna do?
Baby what am i gonna do with you?
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
What am i going to do?
