Calling other sounds
You out there on the seas
Today is dull and mild
On a stroppy little island
Of mixed up people

Did you hear the story
Of violent behavior?
The episodes get sent around
Everyone

Give us sordid details
Tie them on the main sail
The drum and gun
Of estatedom very near

Living in magazines
Not looking for a reason
Why people stand all alone
In the night on the scrubs

Calling other sounds
You out there on the seas
Today is dull and mild
On a stroppy little island
Of mixed up people

Some of us find
To give it all your own
Rises up the land
And nothings gonna hold you down

Not gonna be a victim
Not gonna be a victim
Not gonna be a victim

Standing on the sideline
With God as my witness

Oh, its alright
Everything jolly
Running up the hill
On a stroppy little island
Of mixed up people

Some of us find
To give it all your all
Rises up the land
And nothing gonna hold you down
