Circle of fifths and the one you can miss, can you keep the secrets well
Look at the past and the manners that lacked, can you keep the secrets well
Now in the morning, as the circle if forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows
Back on the bus oh-m-m-m you must, can you keep the secrets well
Sun on you pate and the fork on your plate, can you keep the secrets well
Now in the morning, as the circle if forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows
When its discreet then your never complete, can you keep the secrets well
Fifth in the traps and you know that you'll lapse, can you keep the secrets well
Now in the morning, as the circle if forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows
Can you keep them for yourself
Can you keep yourself as well
