[Strophe 1]
It was cold, but she was lovely
I was told that she would never love me, yeah, yeah
But still I hoped the love I felt it could be trusted
So my case soon came to justice
I found out they had taken my rights long ago
And what they gave in return wasn't nearly so
But how could I've known never was I shown
Little had I grown, inside I was torn
But her life's my concern
I long have ignored the fact that I love you
But I can't anymore

[Refrain]
Oh my lady you're gone for a year
She told me maybe, once she could stay here with me
Oh she's alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul
There's a glow in my heart in my mind, in my soul
There's a glow, there's a glow, there's a glow
There's a glow, there's a glow

[Strophe 2]
Where my lady are you now
A love so sacred still not allowed, life is hard
Sometimes, life can be dreadfull
And this life I guess is more than a handfull
In this war, we can not use weapons
And in this war we can only learn lessons
They had taken unripe fruits from the tree
And I learned my lesson when they gave them to me
More could I see, clouds under me
I saw wars upon land I saw wars under sea

[Refrain]
Oh my lady you're gone for a year
She told me maybe, once she could stay here with me
Oh she's alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul
There's a glow in my heart in my mind, in my soul
There's a glow, there's a glow, there's a glow
There's a glow, there's a glow

[Outro]
Oh my lady you're gone for a year
