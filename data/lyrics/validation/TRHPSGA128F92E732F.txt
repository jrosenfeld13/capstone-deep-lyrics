You ain't never been blue; no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues"

I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
And in the evenin' when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues"
