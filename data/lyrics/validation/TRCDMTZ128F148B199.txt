God, please bring the rain
Yeah, bring it soon
Let it flood right through the houses
Into Judy's room

With a father on amphetamines
Her mother hides the pearls
Reach out into the darkness
And find my little girl

Cause she's angry like a salesman
Who just couldn't make a sale
Threw the wedding rings in the sewer
And damned them all to hell

Please lead her to the mountain
That you fashioned out of sand
While the roaches climb the walls
From the hotel where he calls

Most people never find a love
Most people never find a love
Sometimes you just can't be a man
Sometimes you just can't be a man
When you're living in the darkness
Of the shadowlands
The shadowlands
The shadowlands
