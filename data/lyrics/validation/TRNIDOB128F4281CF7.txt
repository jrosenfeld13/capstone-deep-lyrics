[Verses]
Say, let's get known
If we keep it up, we'll show the haters
It's gonna be soon not later

Hey! Let's get known!
If we work real hard, we can buy some matching clothes
For our live shows

Look at the ants on the floor
They work real hard, lifting three times their mass
And sometimes more

So what do you say?
Let's get known
Let's have two spotlights shining
With all our work shown

What do you say? It's all on the line
