I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
