You said you'd never break my heart
Hey
And we'll never be a-part
So seeing you after so long
Got me spinning round, round, round, round
You said we'd always be together
And to me you were so precious
So after you what happens now?
You got me feeling down, down, down, down

So I think I gotta go
Cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again
So I'm thinking thinking

I think I gotta go
Before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more
So I think I gotta go

Seeing you after so long mmm
Feels so strange cause the feelings ain't gone
Like a rollercoaster ride
Got me spinning round, round, round, round

So I think I gotta go
Cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again
So I'm thinking thinking

I think I gotta go
Before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more
So I think I gotta go

You see the damage has been done
And now I know you're not the one
Cause my heart just wants to run and run and run and run

So I think I gotta go
Before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving again
So I'm thinking thinking

So I think I gotta go
Cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again
So I'm thinking thinking

I think I gotta go
Before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more
So I think I gotta go
