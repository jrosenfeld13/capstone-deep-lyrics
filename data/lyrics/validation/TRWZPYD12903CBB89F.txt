[Verse]
Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly you too low
Come on back to earth, my friend
Come on back up with me
We all been through the night time, babe
Now let's reap the waves of reality

With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

Playing too much with one toy tends to lead
Into the foggy
It's so groovy to float around, sometimes even
A jellyfish will agree to that
I said flotation is groovy and easy
Even a jellyfish will agree to that
Yeah, but old jelly's been floating so long
And so slack, lord, there's no kind of bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night is a risk, sometimes
The wind isn't right
