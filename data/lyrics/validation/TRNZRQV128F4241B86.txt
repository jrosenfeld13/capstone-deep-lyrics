No one can take that love away

No more waiting 'cause the day is here
Think he's gonna make her smile
No more waiting 'cause the day is here
Hearts beat as one as they walk down the aisle

And I think that this one's gonna last forever, yeah
I think that love might have found a home
Well, I think that this one's gonna last forever
'Cause I think that love found a home

Marcia, Marcia, quick come and see
This boy ain't never gonna set you free
Hey, Roy Boy, take a look around
She's got her eye on ya
I think she knows what she's found

And I think that this one's gonna last forever, yeah
I think that love might have found a home
Well, I think that this one's gonna last forever
'Cause I think that love found a home
I think that love found a home

God gives his love to you
Blesses this day for you
No one can take that love away

No more waiting 'cause the day is here
Think she's gonna make him smile
No more waiting 'cause the day is here
One song sung as they walk down the aisle

And I think that this one's gonna last forever, yeah
I think that love might have found a home
Well, I think that this one's gonna last forever
'Cause I think that love found a home

And I think that this one's gonna last forever
Well, I think that love might have found a home
Well, I think that this one's gonna last forever
'Cause I think that love found a home

'Cause I think that love found a home
Yeah, you can see and I can see
That I think love found a home
