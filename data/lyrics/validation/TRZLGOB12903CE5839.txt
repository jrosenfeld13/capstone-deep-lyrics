The shiny doors slid open
Nobody was there
But the scent of your aftershave
Wafted through the air
I stepped into the elevator
Touched the number nine
I closed my eyes, breathed deeply
Traveled back in time

Now I am falling through space
I picture your face
Another time and place
You are here
The scent of your cologne
Brings me back home
I feel a peace I haven't known
For years
And years

The revival's still in previews
Opens in two weeks
But I can't wait I buy two tickets
They are expensive seats
The overture begins
It's music that I heard
From a time back when
I could not speak a single word

Now I am falling through space
I picture your face
Another time and place
You are here
Melodies I've always known
Played forever in our home
And like the scent of your cologne
Across the years
It brings you here

I feel sad, I feel happy
I feel twinges of regret
It takes me by surprise
To think it's not over yet

I dreamed that you were still alive
It was an ordinary day
You were puttering about
In your usual way
But when I awoke I looked around
I knew it wasn't true
So I closed my eyes and begged for sleep
To pull me back to you

Now I'm falling through space
I picture your face
Another time and place
You are here
You are laughing in the sun
You are loved by everyone
Your day is never done
In my dreams
You're still here

And you are falling through space
I picture your face
Another time and place
You are here
Melodies I've always known
Play forever in our home
And like the scent of your cologne
Across the years
It brings you here . . 
It brings you here
