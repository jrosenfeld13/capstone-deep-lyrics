Can you feel the life around me
Buzzing with so much hollow faith
Empty of substantial nature
So much life there is to waste
Is it a sin to expect so much more
More than shallow indignities is it really a sin
Is it really a sin

I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
It's a life that you'll never know

Big black heart attack
Asphalt and thunder f**k
No time for looking back
Look out for the trick and steal
I ain't gonna die in front of your smoking gun
Living life on the edge of a knife
Pleasure and pain is all for real

I'm gonna push my luck
I'm gonna ???
I'm gonna ride the life all the way down

Prepackaged truth candy coated lies
Handshake is as advertized
Medicated heads manipulated eyes
I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
It's a life that you'll never know

Big black heart attack
Asphalt and thunder f**k
No time for looking back
Look out for the trick and steal

I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
It's a life that you'll never know

Is it a gun that save your life
Bullet is the ultimate truth
Come on shoot and tell
Sink down taste the dirt
Cry the tears
We all hurt
Let it go
Fly on free now

So much life there is to waste
Is it a sin to expect so much more
More than shallow indignities is it really a sin
Is it really a sin

I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
I'm on a dark ride
I'm on the other side
It's a life that you'll never know
