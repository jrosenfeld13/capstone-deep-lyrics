I got the all night Laundry Mat blues
Washing everything I own except my shoes
I got ring around the collar
And it smells like sweat
A dollar in the drier
And it ain't dry yet

If you wear clothes, you got to pay the dues
Sing the all night Laundry Mat blues
Yes you do
Sing the all night Laundry Mat blues
