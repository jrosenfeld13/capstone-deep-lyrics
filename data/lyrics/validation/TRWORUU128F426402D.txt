{Intro}

Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know

She's the one makes me feel so good
When everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down
So I've got something to show

Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages

Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show

Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages

{Bridge}

Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages

Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show

You know

Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know
