And in poor seconds
The filthy figures surrounding
Become obstacles

Smell of acid thoughts

Intoxicated eyes, madly
Are you searching for the obscure calm
But the partial blindness doesn't relieve
And viscid words are shoves to the fury
My hostile guide

Memories contribute to mental fall
My skin refuses to feel
Hide my mind from the desire
Of wound, deep wound

I drag between a liquid grey and the hole

Intoxicated eyes, madly
Are you searching for the obscure calm
But the partial blindness doesn't relieve
And viscid words are shoves to the fury
My hostile guide

Memories contribute to mental fall
My skin refuses to feel
Hide my mind from the desire
Of wound, deep wound

No way
By now, there's no way
And I spit on these ruins
What silliness
What silliness
What silliness

Quiet
