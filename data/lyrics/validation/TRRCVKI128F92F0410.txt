[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink
Just your mothers, HO!
Bleeding in a sink, poisoning a drink
Burning up, my sweet, Clementine!
Trampling a shrink, bleeding in a sink
Hallelujah wink, getting on the brink
Just your mothers, HO!
Hallelujah wink, murdering a shrink
Burning up

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Oh, my sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
Its in the making, baby
My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
Its in the making, baby, oh

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Killing with a stink, bleeding in a sink
Poisoning a drink, getting on the brink
Just your mothers, HO!
Bleeding in a sink, trampling a shrink
Burning up, my sweet, Clementine!
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink
Just your mothers, HO!
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Burning up

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
Its in the making, baby
My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
Its in the making, baby, oh

[Bridge: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
I saw her laugh
Then she said:
Go away
I saw her laugh
Then she said, then she said:
Go away, away
Ohhh...

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
Its in the making, baby
My sweet revenge
Will be yours
Its in the making

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Its in the taking, making, baking, taking, faking, oh!
HO, my sweet Clementine, HO
Should been could been
Would been would been you
Should been could been
Would been would been you
