It will feel like you have been there before
Driving down an old dirt road
A strange feeling suddenly comes over you
To know you've reached another dead end

In the darkness you will be searching for hope
There is no truer test for the soul
Then a force within you begins to emerge
The human spirit is reborn

Finding something to believe in
Setting out your path in life
Reaching all of your hopes and dreams
Find The Light
