She just likes her coffee
Hot and black and in the morning sun
Proceeds to read the paper
Right on through until the score is done
Don't you know

And I will bring you roses
Big enough to brighten up your day
And I won't hold your hand now
But I'm sure I'm well on my way
Don't you know

You will be the sun
When you rise you start my day
And you will be the one
Who controls my every way
Can you be
Can you be
My remedy

I will bring you roses
Big enough to brighten up your day
And I won't hold your hand now
But I'm sure I'm well along my way
Don't you know

You will be the sun
When you rise you start my day
And you will be the one
Who controls my every way
Can you be
Can you be
My remedy

You will be the sun
When you rise you start my day
And you will be the one
Who controls my every way
Can you be
Can you be
My remedy

Can you be
Can you be
My remedy

Oh can you be
Oh can you be
My remedy
