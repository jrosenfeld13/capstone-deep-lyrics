1845 - until the fires die
All our hopes and our dreams are a far cry
1845 - until the hate dies
All the sticks and the stones and the names fly
1845 - look into my eyes
You wanna burn with the rest be my guest - die
1845 - under a dark cloud
You wanna walk in the past
Is it black enough now

1845
Let's take another ride

No more, I see no reason to die
Not for a dream, not for a lie
Not for a queen, not for a king
Not for the words in the song that you sing
The way we live, the way we die
The way it is - hold your head up
The way we live, the way we die
The way it is - hold your head up

1845
Let's take another ride

No more, I see no reason to die
Not for a flag, not for a high
Not for a god, not for a book
Not for the world and the way it should look
The way we live, they way we die
The way it is - hold your head up
The way we live, the way we die
The way it is - hold your head up

Until the fires die - A million dead

Is it black enough now?
