I'm in a liquid mode, ready to explode
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby
I'm a cosmic queen, taking gipsy green
With an A plus in retro diving

I'm a midnight cat, with a flick-flash act
I'm your poison ma oh ah baby
I can brake the ground, to the ultra sound
Do the can-can on XP Island

I wanna love and take you there
And show the magic you can share
This is your island in the sun

Aqua playa, jigging desire
Taking all the night away
Aqua playa, freaking you higher
Keep on living for the day
And just be alive, be alive, be alive
Face your fantasy
And just be alive, be alive, be alive
It's your destiny

I'm a rack attack, in a feedback shack
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby
I'm an overload, all the fuses blown
No control and I'm peeking, peeking

I'm gonna show you paradise
You can have heaven in your eyes
This is your island in the sun

Aqua playa, jigging desire
Taking all the night away
Aqua playa, freaking you higher
Keep on living for the day
And just be alive, be alive, be alive
Face your fantasy
And just be alive, be alive, be alive
It's your destiny

It's your destiny, it's your destiny
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby

Aqua playa, jigging desire
Taking all the night away
Aqua playa, freaking you higher
Keep on living for the day
(Aqua playa, jigging desire)
It's your destiny, it's your destiny
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby
(Aqua playa, freaking you higher)
It's your destiny, it's your destiny
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby
