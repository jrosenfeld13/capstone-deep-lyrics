We've got to get it together
You bring the wine, we'll bring the weather
We haven't come to be clever
Let's make it now 'cause this could be never
We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance

Now that we've come to a showdown
We won't allow you a second to slow down
The moment has come to deliver
You as the taker, and we as the giver
We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance

All of the world loves a raver
We're playin' for ravers who savour the flavour
You all appear calm and collected
Razamanazin' you never expected
We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance

We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance
