Yeah-ahh...
Looking round the room
I can tell that you
Are the most beautiful girl in the...room
In the whole wide room
Oooh

And when you're on the street
Depending on the street
I bet you are definitely in the top three
Good looking girls on the street...yeah...
And depending on the street, ooh...
And when I saw you at my mate's place
I thought what...is...she...doing...
At my mate's place
How did Dave get a hottie like that to a party like this?

Good one Dave!!!
Ooohhhh you're a legend, Dave!
I asked Dave if he's going to make a move on you
He's not sure
I said "Dave do you mind if I do?"
He says he doesn't mind
But I can tell he kinda minds
But I'm gonna do it anyway
I see you standing all alone by the stereo
I dim the lights down very low, here we go

You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be a waitress
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be an air hostess in the 60s
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model

And then I seal the deal
I do my moves
I dance the robot
Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh!

It's twelve o two
Just me and you
And seven other dudes
Around you on the dance floor
I draw you near
Let's get outta here
Let's get in a cab
I'll buy you a kebab!

Now I can't believe
That I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl I have ever seen
With a kebab
Ooooooohhh

Why don't we leave?
Let's go to my house and we can feel each other up on the couch
Oh no. I don't mind taking it slow-ho-ho, no-ho-ho, yeah

Cause you're so beautiful
You're so beautiful-ul-ul...
You're like one of those girls i've definitely been chatting to in that chat room
You're so beautiful
Wild slut angel 22 at yahoo
You're so beautiful
Like a tree
Or some nice ceramics or something
Or like a high class prostitute
You're so beautiful
But you'd probably have to keep your normal job
A part-time model!
But i could see you in an auto show dancing on a car
Spending part of your time, modeling
And part of your time, next to meeeeeeeeee!
And i suppose the  rest of your time doing your normal job
