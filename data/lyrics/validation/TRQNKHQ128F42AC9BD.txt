[Chorus:]
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down

[Verse 1:]
Daddy said
Now come, girl
We`re headed down the road to Augusta
And thinking through his clenched teeth
He called Mama's name
Then he cussed her

He said
Girl, you're young
But some dude has come along
And stole your mother
Aw, but you can't steal a willing mind
Whose mama's always looking for a lover

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
With dusty teardrops on his face
My daddy cried
And big steps he was taking
And halfway running to keep up
My shorter legs were so tired and shaking

Where did I go wrong, girl?
Why would she leave us both this way?
At times like these
A child of ten never knows exactly what to say

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
We searched in every bar room
And honky-tonk as well
And finally Daddy found them
But Lord
You know the rest is hard to tell

He sent me out to wait
But scared
I looked back through the door
And Daddy left them both
Soaking up the sawdust on the floor

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
