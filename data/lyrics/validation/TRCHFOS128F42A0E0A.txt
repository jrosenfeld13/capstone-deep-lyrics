I feel so strange; what's wrong with me?
You've got a problem that you can't see
But I've got a feeling that the rumours are true
I see the girl got a hook in you

You carry on believing
That you can take or leave it
Now who are you deceiving?
'Cause when it's own up time, she's in the back of your mind

She's got her hooks in you
Yeah, she's got her hooks in you

You said you'd never let it happen again
You spend your money and you're deeper in
Your fair-weather friends call two by two
To let you know what's wrong with you

But now your heartbeat's thumpin'
You watch your nerve ends jumpin'
Well I can tell you something
When it's own up time, you're gonna toe the line

She's got her hooks in you
Yeah, she's got her hooks in you
She got her hooks in me, too

Say, I feel so strange; what's wrong with me?
You've got a problem that you can't see
But I've got a feeling that the rumours are true
I see the girl got her, I see the girl got her hooks in you

Yeah, she got her hooks in you (she got her hooks in you)

She got her hooks in you (she got her hooks in you)
She got her hooks in you

Yeah!
