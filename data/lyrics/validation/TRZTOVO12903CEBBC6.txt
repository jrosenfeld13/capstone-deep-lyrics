Hold me now or ever hold your peace
In sickness and in health, there's a wealth in staying true
Who's the water to your fire?
Who's the earth to your air?
How can you be without some symmetry?
Hold me now or ever hold your peace
When the honeymoon is over
It takes more than a friend to make it to the end
"Nature 10 is the form you fill in when declaring equipment being brought
Back into the country. There were a few brain cells missing, among other
Things. "
