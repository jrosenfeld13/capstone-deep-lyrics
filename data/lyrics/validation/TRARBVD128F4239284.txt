She took a double barrel twelve guage buck shot to her alarm clock
She'll kill that George Strait baby blue with one shot
She was a cussin' and a screamin' off the wrong side of the bed
Madder than hell with him in her head
Whole trailer park knew the radio had done it again

Ah damn that radio for playin' their song
Stirrin' up a memory she thought was gone
God knows that old DJ don't know what he's done
Ah damn that radio for playin' their song

Well she fired up the Chevy and she tour it up and down the rural rout
Rippin' on two wheels 'round the courthouse
She was mad at George and WKXY
But she was lookin' for the sucker that had lefter the cry
Everybody in town was runnin' for a place to hide

Ah damn that radio for playin' their song
Stirrin' up a memory she thought was gone
God knows that old DJ don't know what he's done
Ah damn that radio for playin' their song

Down at the station, Lord, the phones ring all day long
Whole town callin' beggin' please don't play that song

Now the preacher was preachin' in the spirit of jubilation
To a sunny day happy face weddin' congregation
He read 'til death do us part' straight outta the word
Then a chevy flew by and just flipped him the bird
He said 'father forgive her'
As the bride ran shakin' her fist
(Get 'em bitch!)

Ah damn that radio for playin' their song
Stirrin' up a memory she thought was gone
God knows that old DJ don't know what he's done
Ah damn that radio for playin' their song
Stirrin' up a memory she thought was gone
God knows that old DJ don't know what he's done
Ah damn that radio
Damn that radio
Damn that radio for playin' their song
