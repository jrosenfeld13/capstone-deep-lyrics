[Pre-Chorus]
If ever you think you're not the one, I'll remind you
If ever you think you're about to run, I will find you
Come on to me, just let it go
If ever you think you're not the one, I'll remind you

[Chorus]
Come on my love
Come on my love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
If ever you think you're not the one, I'll remind you
If ever you think you're not the one
