Jake leg!
Steal this wine away
Flay me
Underneath the brine

Running away
Through the sick and the pure
"Mind your feet!" lest they firmament tread

Crawl past the soft
Spiraled sinewy teeth
"Soiled dove!" steal the fruit of its jaws

Lady!
Keep those hounds at bay
Feed me
The fruits of Avalon

The body's a vessel
The hands find a cure
"Flesh is weak!" and my lip needs a meal

Weak in the knees
And you're wet on the floor
"Ace of staves!" we will dance evermore
