Every night the same old game
After the show you are looking for something
You're on the road for much too long
Your love has grown between your legs
Don't need a love romance
All you want is something to ride
Princess you wanna open your legs
Is it time to show you my way of love
Reject emotions - satisfy your feelings
Victim of lust traped in lunatic possession
Reject emotions too horny to be alone
Reject emotions
Too shy maiden with innocent eyes
No chance for you to strike tonight
They don't realize your game of love
Love is a lie - a wasted business
