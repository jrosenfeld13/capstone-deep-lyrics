I see the sun and I see the calendar
The days go floating by so slowly in a blur
I read the numbers and I discard everyone
I burn my fingers on the pages of the sun

I'll tell you why tomorrow

Moonlight pulling all the water to the beaches
Soaking time into everything that it reaches
Turn it upside down and count the spilling sand
Seize the moment with a minute hand

I'll tell you why tomorrow

Men and animals are floating through the sky
Every month or so a new one passes by
Forming circles 'round the planets in the air
Find a newspaper and it is printed there

I'll tell you why tomorrow
