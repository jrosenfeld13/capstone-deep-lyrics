Heard about this girl before
What happened to her, I'm not sure
She could never find real love
She's just a constant lover

And when you find the time
When he's just livin' off of someone else
City lights, my dear
Are looking oh-so-pretty from that hill

She goes 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.'
And these voices in my head
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They told me I would end up dead
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If I fell asleep with you
What could I do?

While he's playing his guitar
She knows the songs and he'll get far
Girl, keep your beauty
They say that's your duty

And when it just ain't good
And you don't want his kisses anymore
Don't be a ragdoll, dear
'Cause he'll just keep you hangin' from that wall

And she goes 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.'
And these voices in my head
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They told me I would end up dead
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If I fell asleep with you
What could I do?

Hey!

She loved
He came
He'll come back again

She loved
He came
He'll come back again

She loved
He came
He won't come back again, yeah

All right!
