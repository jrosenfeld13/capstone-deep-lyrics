I'll catch you again someday
On the streets of pittsburgh pennsylvania
Then again maybe not
Where we can sit and reminisce
About our younger years
And how we'd stay in bed all day
When you should of been in class, then

Then in the night
That light shone down upon you
Made you look like the star that you were
Then in the night
That light shone down upon you
Made you look like the star that you are

Daytime thoughts on those streets
Through winter breezes freezing gusts of wind
Cutting razors to my years
Those bitter cold days cast your silhouette
Angel like through the fogged up cafe glass
Reality became a dream

Then in the night
That light shown down upon you
Made you look like the star that you were
Yea, then in the night
That light shone down upon you
That light shone down upon you

Driving you to the airport
Watching you walk off to the
Plane that did carry you away
You were too sad to look back to wave goodbye
So i'm not going to tell you what you missed
And im not going to tell myself
That i will never find you going in those lights again
Cause i dont know if i will ever have that chance
But still i'll never forget those days we had
And i'll never forget those nights in the dark
In the pitch black moon light
The streets of this town are still cold
And still windy but the 61c doesnt feel the same
You said lets just leave it to fate
So i guess i'll just have to leave it to fate
And wait and remember those days turned to nights

When in the night
That light shone down upon you
Made you look like the star that you were
When in the night
That light shone down upon you
Yea...
