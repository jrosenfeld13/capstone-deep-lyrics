You see it on tv every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid, but it sure is hot
Down in mexico
The weatherman is tryin' to tell me
That it ain't the end
But i see the storm comin'
And i know it ain't my friend
Riff raff
Ain't it a laugh
Riff raff
Always good for a laugh

I'm the kind of guy
That keeps my mouth shut
Don't make a difference to me
So don't bother me when i'm up
And leave me in misery
I never hurt nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun
Riff raff
Ain't it a laugh
Riff raff
Always good for a laugh
