Ahh, you said a bad word
I'm gonna tell your mama on you, huh
She gonna whip you, too, huh
Yeah, that's what's she's gonna do

Get down at your bad self
Talking that bad talk
Saying them bad words

You said a bad word
You'd better take it back
Cause good little girls
Don't talk like that

And if I told your mama
What you said
She'd make you come in the house
And go to bed

But now, wait a minute
We can make a deal
If you do what I tell you
I won't tell your mama on you

Let me whisper in your ear
I don't want everybody
Listening to our business
Come here

Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?

You said a bad word
And don't you forget
That you're not really
In the clear yet

Cause any old day
And any old time
I just might
Wanna change my mind

Like right now

Wait a minute
Baby, we gotta make another deal
Cause that last deal we made
Is gone bye-bye
Let me whisper in your ear some more
I don't want everybody
Listening to our business
Come here

Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?
Are you gonna do it?
Huh, huh, huh?

Well, come on round the house

You said a bad word
Talking that bad talk, come on
All them bad words
Coming out of that pretty little mouth of yours
