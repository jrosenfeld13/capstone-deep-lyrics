[Verse 1]
Don't you make me smile if you don't intend to
Only maybe try if you can pretend to
Well, here is my mission, my reason, my statement
My complaint

Hardly pushed your luck, focused all intention
Don't you think I mind when you said you meant to?
Open up the blinds, pull the curtain, the window
Run away

[Chorus]
You and I (keep with me, love, pretend to)
You and I (came with my love undercover)
You and I ('til we seduced each other)
You-ah-da-da-da-da
You and I (and many lies that don't follow)
You and I (suffered and then we'll recover)
You and I (and then we're cutting off each other's air supply)

[Verse 2]
Girls who spend their lives in disgusting gestures
Always seeking boys to relieve the tension
Maybe you know better, you know something, you know me?
Come and play

Baby, if you try, please do not content to
Anybody knows, you know, I'd cross your temple
Girl, you are the reason, my mission, my lover
My complaint

[Chorus]
You and I (keep with me, love, pretend to)
You and I (came with my love undercover)
You and I ('til we seduced each other)
You-ah-da-da-da-da
You and I (and many lies that don't follow)
You and I (suffered and then we'll recover)
You and I (and then we're cutting off each other's air supply)
