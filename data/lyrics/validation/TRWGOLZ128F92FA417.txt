Blame it n your passionplay
But I know it's just a game
Why don't we fight the fight
Evil it's not here to stay
Broken words are broken ways

And you don't seem to care
Hellhammer - hell - hellhammer

Spread your wings and you'll be free
Hellhammer - hell - hellhammer
Living on the edge won't save ya
Hellhammer - hell - hellhammer

Hellhammer
Hold on - on your pwn
All for one - together we make it
You and me - can touch the sky
One for all - in the name of love
Only we can change the world
Make your dreams reality
One foe all - it's the human key
Don't lose control -
Don't lose your soul
