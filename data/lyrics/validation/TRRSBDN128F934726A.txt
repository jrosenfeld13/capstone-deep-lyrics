I can't deny we've had some good times
We were like a bike built for two
But I can't lie to you, the rumour's comin' true, oh

Another girl's arousing my curiosity
Another girl's arousing my (male) curiosity
And there's not a thing that I can do

I thought my ways, would change around you
I was wrong, hound dogs can't be tamed
It's been a pleasure loving you
But now the pleasure's through

Except tell you that my thoughts are of you or
Though I've chased them away or
Yes it's true I guess I'll always love you or
You were difficult to replace or

I can't deny we've had some good times
Hanging out without parachutes
Oh, but if I stay with you, (When did I ask you to?)
I'd have to cut myself in two oh

It's been a pleasure loving you (can't say the same to you)
But now the pleasure's through

Another girl's arousing my curiosity
Another girl's arousing my (male) curiosity
And there's not a thing that I can do
And there's not a thing that I can do
And there's not a thing that I can do
