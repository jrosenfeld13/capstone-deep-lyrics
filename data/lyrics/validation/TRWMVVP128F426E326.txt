No more smiles no more tears
No more prayers no more fears
Nothing left, why go on
When your lover is gone
Shout with one, ring the bells
Through the towns and the farms
With the shouts and the bells
Bringing him back to my arms
Must each man go to war ever more ever more
While some loner woman stands empty heart empty hands
When the time came to part
And he kissed me goodbye
From the depths of my heart came a great lonely cry
"Heaven have mercy"
"Heaven hae mercy"
Once again they carved his name upon a cross
I remember the dance where we first fell in love
How we walzed around and around
While the stars danced above
We would walk by the shore
Watch the sheeps sail away
Lovers need nothing more
Just a new dream each day
So we dreamed of a home
With a garden so fine
And a son with his eyes
And a nose just like mine
Now its done why be grave?
Why should I live like this?
Shall I wait by the grave for my lost lovers kiss?
Stop the bell, stop the bell!
I have no tears left to cry
Must I stay here in hell?
Lord above let me die
"Heaven have mercy"
"Heaven have mercy"
"Heaven have mercy"
