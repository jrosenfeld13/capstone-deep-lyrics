[Verse 1]
Remember me, the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because
Remember you, the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

[Pre-Chorus]
But was I chasing rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

[Verse 2]
Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh, it used to be enough
Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

[Pre-Chorus]
But was I chasing rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

[Bridge]
I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love
