There were times likes before When she was overcome By happiness And as one her life Her age was prime and vulnerable

Satiate

So you've got the opportunity To take my best away from me She's different now Can't you see Her life structure's been deranged By your greed And for your desires

Let me get my thoughts straight

What gave you the Right to take her away from me

Said you were raised And claimed to be neglected That's no excuse Do you know the pain I feel With your presence Just go away I think you've done your damage Her plans for the future Were dismissed by you

So I will try I think I'll try again To get my life straight And I pray that everything she's seen Won't blind her And everything she's felt Will show in years to come And as for you...
