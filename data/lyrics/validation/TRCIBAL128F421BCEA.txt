[Verse 1]
How many times have I called you
While you were working, just to say
Left messages on your answer machine
About 3 or 4 times a day

[Hook]
There aren't many more ways in words that I can say
So i'll just say numerically
From my heart to you - one-four-three

[Verse 2]
So many times I've bought roses
Just to see that smile on your face
I can't remember how many e-mails I sent you
Just to tell you 'bout my day

[Hook]
There aren't many more ways in words that I can say
So i'll just say numerically
From my heart to you - one-four-three

[Bridge]
Girl you know you are so special to me
And you deserve to be treated exclusively

[Verse 3]
I treat you like Valentines Day 365 a year
Make sure that everything you need will always be right here
Now I just refuse to be your typical ordinary run of the mill
Garden variety lover
(ooh oh oh)

[Verse 4]
I'll make sure everyday you live will be like Christmas Eve
I wanna make you feel fine just like a summer breeze
Cause I refuse to be predictable average run of the mill
Garden variety love
(ohh ohh oh)

[Verse 5]
See sometimes words may get in the way
Of things that you really really meant to say
So I wanna take out this time to
Make sure that how I really feel gets through to you
Cause listen
There aren't many more ways and words that I can say
So I choose to tell you how I feel in a numerical way
Got so tired of trying to find the most complicated way
To say it to you so I simplified and broke it down
To one-four-three - and that means I love you
Sugar you know yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ohh
