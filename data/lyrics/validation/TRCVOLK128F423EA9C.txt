[Verse 1]
Why do cupids and angels
Continually haunt her dreams
Like memories of another life
Is painted on her shirt in capitals
Out on the free free way
There's only she and the they
Represented by the lights

[Interlude]
I went to the store and bought something great
Which samples this song from Washington state

[Verse 2]
Go
Little record go
It is named by
Some guy named joe
And the words
Are the letters of the words
Said
Electrically played
For outer space and those of they who paid
This song is twice occurred
And now its time to go
Away on holiday
