All your old heroes are calling a bluff
Now you're out making messes in the name of love
All your old newspapers collecting dust
There's nothing in them you ain't read about anyway
Giving a nickel and stealing a dime
Drinking champagne when you thinking it's wine
There's more to all this than just touches and time
And even your heroes are learning it everyday
The time has come to change the tune
You think it's morning but it's late afternoon
All your old habits will be given up too soon
The time has come to change the tune
You say you've seen it before in the eyes of the brave:
A later tomorrow and an earlier grave
It's one thing to borrow, another to save
Just when will you follw and just when will you stay
Going down highways not lit so well
Now they're making it something that's easy to sell
Maybe I'm saying what I shouldn't tell
'cause even your heroes are wondering what to say
The time has come to change the tune
You think it's morning but it's late afternoon
All your old habits will be given up too soon
The time has come to change the tune
