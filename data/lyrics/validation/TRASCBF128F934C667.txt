Mourn the dead of the revolution
They know not of what they've done
Unify for retaliation
None for all, and all for one
Three to live
One to kill
We've got body bags to fill
Lacerate this entire nation
It cannot be ignored
Send them down to die
Without a care
Betray the people's trust with prayer
Honor the dead for determination
Spirits of unborn war

Dare to rise to the revolution
They know not what's yet to come
Remains of men
Pave the roads to end
This disgrace we call our nation

[Solo: Gapen]

In the end of the revolution
A new age has just begun
Unified
Justified
None for all
And all for one
