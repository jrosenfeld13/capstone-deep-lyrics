Near my place through the forest and the wood chopped
You can see everything from a fenced-off hill top
From rolling hills through soaking gills
From the gravel path, to the chimney's wrath

Even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Give a bit of meaning, give a bit of meaning

Saw an old drunk, stuck up a tree
I coulda said that's my life but that's not me
It could be said, I was under lead
It could be said that I would wind up dead

But even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Even I can give it meaning, give a bit of meaning, give a bit of meaning

Saw an old drunk, stuck up a tree
I Coulda said that's my life but that's not me
It Could be said, I was under lead
It could be said that I would wind up dead

Even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Even I can be pretentious, even I can give it meaning
Even I can give it meaning, even I can give it meaning
