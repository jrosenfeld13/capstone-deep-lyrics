Don't let the time fool ya
It's got a way of slippin by
If you let it it's gonna rule ya
And leave you high and dry

It's too easy to get lazy
If you don't use what you got
It might even drive you crazy
So get up and move and get hot

Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
I'm on fire, yeah, I'm on fire, yes, I'm on fire, I'm on fire

If you ain't got no music
Go out and find a song
If you got soul you can use it
Feelin so right can't be wrong
Don't be afraid to get burnin'
Don't be afraid if you're not
There's plenty of time now for learnin'
Plenty of time to get hot

Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, yes I'm on fire
Dig it
I'm on fire, yes I'm on fire
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, hot, I'm on fire, yes I'm on fire
I'm on fire, ooh! I'm on fire, I'm on fire, yes I'm on fire
Yes I'm on fire, hot, I'm on fire
