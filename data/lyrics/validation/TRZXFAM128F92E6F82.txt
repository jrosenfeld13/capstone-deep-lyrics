The scene is set for dreaming
Love's knocking at the door
But oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start
For we've been fooled before
The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the magic of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
