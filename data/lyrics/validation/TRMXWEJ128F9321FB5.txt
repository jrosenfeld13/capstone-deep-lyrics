Seems like a pumpkin that grew on the ceiling
Seems like a ceiling that grew on the floor
She's taking something to stop her from feeling
Anything she doesn't want

Call up the doctor prescribe you a person
Someone with bells from the opposite sex
What can you do you're a guy with a curse on
Always to wonder what's coming next?

Seems like a party that's already over
Might as well see what they've left on the rug
Isn't it great when the only solution
Is taking somebody like they were a drug

Isn't it great when you think you're in love with someone
Isn't it great when you think you're in love with someone
Isn't it great when you think you're in love with someone
Isn't it great when you think you're in love with someone
