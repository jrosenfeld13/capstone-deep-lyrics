And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you will know Andmoreagain
For you can see you in her eyes
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum

And when you've given all you had
And everything still turns out bad
And all your secrets are your own
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum

And I'm wrapped in my armor
But my things are material
And I'm lost in confusions
'Cause my things are material

And you don't know how much I love you
Oh, oh, oh

And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you might be Andmoreagain
For you just wish and you are here
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum

And I'm wrapped in my armor
But my things are material
And I'm lost in confusions
'Cause my things are material

And you don't know how much I love you
Oh, oh, oh
