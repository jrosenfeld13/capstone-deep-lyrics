Aight
(Tired af) but i don't care, yo

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the lane, laying down in the pen
Crushing the ten, blasting the past, lasting the last
Rushing and blushing my face
Why i ask, everything flashing!
You blessing, i'm sweating, they guessing, you begging
They beheading off, we be dreading off, we'll be spreading off
I'm thinking, sink in the kingpin
Begin to start shrinking in
Less process, wrong way to access more mess
Why i adress, i hate my guts, leave today long way more stress
Open weave then, i never achieve again so fade my guts then
They're here to not care! so when will you believe again?

[Hook]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
