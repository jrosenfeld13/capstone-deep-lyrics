Here's a little something for all you lovers
Snuggle deep down inside your covers
Make yourselves at home and I'll sing you a song about love

It can start with just a chance encounter
He doesn't know a single thing about her
A casual thread and look out, it led to love

It takes too long to see what it takes two to love for it's soon to be
And you could easily forget to get upset and set it free

Sitting in the window at a table alone
Watching dancers circle to a saxophone
They get up to go now they know it's love

From the tip of Alaska to the edge of Spain in every long and latitude
You'll find it's the same put one and one together and you're not to blame
If it's love
