[MRS. DU MAURIER]
I know you feel alone
But we are here beside you
She left the stars up in the sky
So they could guide you
And you will see her in your dreams
For Neverland is closer than it seems
Just try to remember
All the things she taught you
You made her proud to be alive
How she adored you
And I can see her in your eyes
She'll always be there by your side

When your feet don't touch the ground
And your voice won't make a sound
You'll be safe in this place above the clouds

[BARRIE/MRS. DU MAURIER]
I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I found is true
I was so amazed

[BARRIE/MRS. DU MAURIER/BOYS]
Make believe and you will find out

[BARRIE/MRS. DU MAURIER]
It's true
[BOYS]
I know that it's true
[ENSEMBLE]
When your feet don't touch the ground
And your world's turned upside down
You can fly
To the sky
Above the clouds

When your feet don't touch the earth
You won't feel the things that hurt
Keep your faith
And in time
You will spread your wings and fly
Fly, fly
And fly
