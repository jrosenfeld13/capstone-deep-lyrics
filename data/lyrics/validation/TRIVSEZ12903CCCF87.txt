I was a banker
A family man
Working in Paris
When I began

Living my daydreams
I left my wife
Sailed for the islands
To start a new life

Down in the tropics
A colorful world
Green of the ocean
And brown native girls

Now I'm an artist
And I see nothing wrong
To paint Tahitian
Without a sarong, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

Am I a mad man
To follow the sun
When it's every man's dream
To do what I've done

Oh, no needs, no worries
And no sense of time
She's Polynesian
And she is all mine

Today I'll paint her
In yellows and reds
Tonight we'll make love
With stars overhead, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

I left the temple
Of civilized man
To dance the tango
Utopian

Mmm, how can I leave here
How can I go back?
The life here is so
Aphrodisiac

Her eyes, her lips
And the smell of her hair
Make me a savage
And I cease to care, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language
