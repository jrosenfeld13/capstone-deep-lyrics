I always wanted to become a good good boy
Now I know I am not
They say "Boy you're living on the moon"
But I swear I am not

If I could I surely would take a plane
And watch the world from the bright side, from the good side
And make an air pocket in my cloudy mind
Where burning supernovas seem like dying candle lights

I always wanted to become a real real man
Now I know I know I know I am not
The say "Boy you should try to keep your feet down on the ground"
But I swear I can not

If I could I surely would take a plane
And watch the world from the bright side, from the good side
And make an air pocket in my cloudy mind
Where burning supernovas seem like dying candle lights

I always wanted to become a good good boy
Now I know I am not
