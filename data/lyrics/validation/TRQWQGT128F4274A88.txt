Early morn I was up long before dawn
I watched you sleep
I counted every beat of your heart
Now we both know we'll never go back there again
Guilty as charged that's all

Fallen snow - cover me
Wash me pure - Hold me tight
What else is there left for you and for me?
The life we once held on to caught in a riptide out to sea

I left with innocent eyes to a nation so poor
I felt humanity cry from the ravage of war
I infiltrated the machine and it broke me in two
I wish for amnesty now and I find it in you
I make this vow

The road to this place under a thundering sky
It's a long walk to heaven
Lord knows I've tried
Just look around wind and snow and ice are all I see
Save for you my queen

Pounding rhythms
Distant footsteps
Echo fear
And drive my pain
I am crying out for love and for life eternal
I am witness
I've been purchased with blood
So many souls will burn out
The call requires an answer

I've chased material gain it's the emptiest dream
I've watched it turn back to dust and it don't mean a thing
The spirit found its way in and it changed my whole life
I'm offering you my hope with the gift of this light
Please take this vow

Let's pack away all our memories of home
Never look back
Certainly never return
Begin anew you and I and snow and ice
Will you surrender all your all to me?

And in the comfort of my arms both noble and strong
I'll guide you safely through the storms
I will make you my song
Remaining steady and true for the rest of your life
I offer you up my hand wanna make you my wife
Please take this vow
A passion purer than gold or the night's brightest star
My love for you only grows
It knows no earthly bounds
The time is right for us now just believe what I say
I take your hand in my hand
And I promise you the world
Promise you the world
Promise you the world
I make this vow
