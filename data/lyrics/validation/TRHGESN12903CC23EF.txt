Wrap around
The white pavement
Feels so inviting
So lie back and gain bruises with me

It's been a long time since I've seen you from above
And you're still beautiful

Leave me
We'll... start something new in our embrace

With that, crash your parts into mine
Intoxicate me with your many voices
And I'll never leave you
And I'll never leave
And I'll never leave you

Intoxicate me with all your voices
And crash your parts into mine

So lost inside of you
Till now, I think we waited so long

So lost inside of you
Till now, I think we waited too long

Lock your doors and close your shades
I'll never find...

Leave me
We'll... start something new in our embrace
