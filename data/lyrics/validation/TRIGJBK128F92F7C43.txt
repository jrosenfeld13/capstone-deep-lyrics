(G)When midnight comes and people(C) homeward (G)tread
Seek out your blanket and your(C) feathered(G) bed
Home comes the(D) rover,his journey's(G) over
Yield up the night time to old(C) John O(G)'Dreams

(2)
Across the hill the sun has gone astray
Tomorrows cares are many dreams away
The stars are flying,your candle's dying
Yield up the night time to oldJohn O'Dreams

(3)
Both man and master in the night are one
All things are equal when the day is done
The prince and the ploughman,the slave the free man
All find their comfort in old John O'Dreams
All find their comfort in old John O'Dreams
(4)
When sleep it comes the dreams come running clear
The hawks of morning cannot reach you here
Sleep is a river,flow on for ever
And for your boatman choose old John O'Dreams
Yes for your boatman choose old John O'Dreams
