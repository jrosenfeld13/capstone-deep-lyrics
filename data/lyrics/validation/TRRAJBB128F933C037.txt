When the sun shines bright
You are looking alright
But you get depressed
When you see your life's a mess

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown

The wind is blowing in your hair
Life is not fair
Your conscience's knocking at your door
Who is it for?
Who are your friends?
There's something wrong with them
Who are you then?
Are you the lad insane?

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown
And you know I'm not easily moved
When sadness is there it can't be removed

You can't blame it on the weather
I know that it's untrue
Things are made to last forever
With a person like you

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown

Things are made to last forever
