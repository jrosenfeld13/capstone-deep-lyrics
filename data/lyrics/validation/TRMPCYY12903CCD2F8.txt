I WANNA PLAY HOUSE WITH YOU
Writer Cy Coben

Baby baby baby baby baby
Come back baby I wanna play house with you
You may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But dont you be nobodys fool
Now come baby come
Come back baby come
Come back baby
I wanna play house with you
Now this is one thing baby
I want you to know
Well-a, come on back to me little girl

We can make like we did before (chorus)
Well now this is one thing baby
That Im talkin about
Well, come on back to me little girl

So we can play some house (chorus)
Well, listen to me baby
Try to understand
Well, Id rather see you dead little girl

Than to be with another man (chorus)
