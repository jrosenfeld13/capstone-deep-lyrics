When you're down and troubled and you some loving care
And nothing, oh nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall, all you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah, you've got a friend

If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind just begins to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking upon your door

You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again, oh yeah, don't you know that
Winter, spring, summer or fall, hey now all you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
They'll take your soul if you let them
Oh but don't you let them

You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running, running, yeah, yeah, yeah, to see you again
Oh yeah, don't you know that
Winter spring summer or fall, hey now, all you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah, you've got a friend, you've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
Ain't it good to know?
Ain't it good to know?
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
