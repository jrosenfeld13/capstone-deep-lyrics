12-12-84
12-12-84, Ten O Clock at night
Funny how you can remember
Certain Moments in your life
I wish I could go back
To take back the words I said
Though it's been years since that night
They still echo in my head
Chorus//Time is a teacher
And time has taught me well
What brings a man to his knees
Is often brought on by himself
If a second chance were offered
And she could love me like before
I'd go back to the end and start over again
On 12-12-84\\
A cold wind was blowing
It whistled through the pines
I told her I don't need her
And she told me goodbye
I remember embers dying
In the ashes and the coals
And like smoke up the chimney
I watched a true love go
//Chorus\\
I'd go back to the end and start over again
On 12-12-84
