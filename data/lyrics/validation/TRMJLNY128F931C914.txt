Ooh lordy
That's right
Ooh, look out, y'all

Me and the men watchin' late night tv
Saw a scary man came on to me
And said, "Hey man
And take my hand."

Looky here
I said no, no, no mister please
You can't bring a bad boy to his knees
Got a subtle way to say "Get out of town"
Shoot the preacher down

Just when I thought that he was dead
Got right back on his feet and this is what he said
"Black is bad, white is right."
But white by day is black by night

Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down

Ooh, such is Heaven, such is Hell
Ain't no vacant lot to buy, you gotta sell
Save our souls for judgement day
Cash your chips, you're on your way

Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down

Oh yes indeed, a little negotion
Just touch the boob tube and y'all will be healed
Take my hand
And I'll lead you to the promised land

Oh, shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down
Shoot the preacher down

Ow, shoot, shoot
Yeah hahahaha
Shoot the preacher down
Oh, oh
Shoot the preacher down
