Once again, they tell me that I'm insensible
It must be true, it's always the same accusation

You don't feel well and you seek a reason
I guess it's me, I guess it's my lack of compassion

And I fake to sympathize
With the struggles you endure every day

These desperate cries
Surround my isolation
I wanna be alone
Am I whole? Am I hollow?

Before my eyes the most beautiful girl cries
Still I run to avoid any complications

And I fake to sympathize
With the struggles you endure every day

These desperate cries
Surround my isolation
I wanna be alone
Am I whole? Am I hollow?

When heaven descends to the
Palms of my hands
I wanna be alone
Am I whole? Am I hollow?

These desperate cries
Surround my isolation
I wanna be alone
I wanna be

When heaven descends to the
Palms of my hands
I wanna be alone
I wanna be
