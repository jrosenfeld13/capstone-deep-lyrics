How does it feel
To have a key but not a clue?
Now love is dancing frenzied
Fooling me and you
Where did we go?
Where did we go?
I realize that we have lost reality
Keeping on popping questions
No one answers freely
Where did we go?
Where did we go?

Is our love at sea?
I don't know now
Missing out on lee
With every single wave

Give me a call
There's so much I have to say
I miss out on the sky
I miss the hot and glaring days
Where did we go?
Where did we go?
Letting remember myself
'As good as it gets'
That film made me feel
That somehow nothing's over yet
Where did we go?
Where did we go?

Is our love at sea?
I don't know now
Missing out on lee
With every single wave
