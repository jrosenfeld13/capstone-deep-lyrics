No stranger to tears
No stranger to irrational fears
No stranger to you
Thinking the unspeakable i'm craving to do
I feel your anguish
I feel your pain
I feel your heartache i must feel it again
Good god above have we already not suffered enough
Good god above have we already not suffered your love
Can't talk
Coming down
Don't give it away don't think it out loud
Something to say something profound
One angel short of heaven
One angel short of heaven
I need a hole to hide in i had one you denied it
