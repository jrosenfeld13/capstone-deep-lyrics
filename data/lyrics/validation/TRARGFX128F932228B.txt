Had a lot of things to say
Had a lot of points to make
Put me down on walk sweet take before you go away
Close the door in case you stay
And I can't believe it's already tired
Oh go and cut all my wires

Little bit of this is good
You always said it would
Waits to be overheard
Quote yourself word for word before you go away
Close the door in case you stay
And I can't believe it's already tired
Oh go and cut all my wires

In case you stay
And I can't believe it's already tired
Oh go and cut all my wires
All my wires
All my wires
