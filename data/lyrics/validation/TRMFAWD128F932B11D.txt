Sunday morning, got the hazy, hazy janes
I turn to you and inhale you where you lay
Took a wander through the garden to await the long, long day
And then roll for a while on a violet flowerbed

Oh, you kiss my lips again and again and again
And then again, again

We would watch the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down
And it washed our bodies so cleanly
That we would seem to rise up off of the cold, cold ground
It's a shame the way it seems to go

Cause now my best friend, my partner in crime
I'm afraid it looks like we're gonna have to go our separate ways
You see, the thing is, I love you, I love you
But you see, I resent you all the same
And all my other friends, they're just saying you're slowing me down

Oh, but I should have known you'd turn to me and say
Before you throw too much of me away

Don't you remember seeing the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down?
And it washed our bodies so cleanly
That we would seem to rise up off of the cold, cold ground

I see the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down
Oh and it washed our bodies so cleanly
That we could feel the rise up off of the cold, cold ground, yeah, yeah

It was in love, I was created
And in love is how I hope I die
Yeah, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I

Yeah, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I
Yeah, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I, yeah

Yeah, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I, yeah
Yeah, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I, yeah

We watched the sun coming up easy
Yeah, we watched the sun coming up easy
Yeah, we watched the sun coming up easy
Oh, we watched the sun coming up easy

Oh, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, I
Oh, it was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die, oh, yeah

Oh, we watched the sun coming up easy
Oh, we watched the sun coming up easy
