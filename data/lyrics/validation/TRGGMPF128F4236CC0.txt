DEVIL:
I feel the hot wind blowin'
From the west to the east
I feel the hot wind blowin'
Can't get no relief

I feel the hot wind blowin'
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night
I feel my confidence growin'
And I know I'm gonna be alright

I see the volcanos
'Rupting and erupting
Red walls of fire

I got Corruption
Seduction
Destruction
Reproduction
I got Las Vegas in my mind
Seem like it's stuck up in there
Like it's been there for all times
You can take your desert
Goddamn it, give me mine
'Cause I got Las Vegas in my mind

Through these portals
Pass the rich and the famous
Through these portals
Pass the very best at what they do
Man, they're the greatest!
It's the land of giant women
But the little man is king
Here in Las Vegas
Man, they got ev'rything
Run with it

They got English girls
With legs so long
You gotta use a stepladder
To lick their love thing
And it's a family place, too, now
So bring the kids along
They're gonna have a real good time here

They got wild women from Borneo
Playin' the piano
In your bungalow
They got monkey women from the Amazon
Or something really funky
From the lands beyond
They're here in Las Vegas
They're here in Las Vegas
Las Vegas!
Boyzlibbininbakeyeyellavan!
Man, I'm speaking in tongues
Uruh. Uruh. Uruh
