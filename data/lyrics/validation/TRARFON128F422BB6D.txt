There's only one cloud in the sky
There's only one cloud in the sky
And it's hanging, hanging round over my head
The weather man said It could change
The weather man said it could change
But it looks like my dark cloud is here to stay
Lightening strikes me down
Lightening strikes me down
Shakes me up and puts me down to the ground
I feel so alive
I feel so alive
There's only, only one cloud in the sky
I love this cloud of mine
I love this cloud of mine
It's a crazy, a crazy thing to say
If my cloud should ever go
If my cloud should ever go
My life, my life would never be the same
Life would, my life would never be the same
