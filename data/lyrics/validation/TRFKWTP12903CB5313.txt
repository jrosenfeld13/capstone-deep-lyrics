Mmmn, mmmn
Mmmn, mmmn

My bell rang this morning, didn't know which way to go
My bell rang this morning, didn't know which way to go
I had the blues so bad
I sit right down on my floor

I felt like going on the mountain, jumping over in the sea
I felt like going in the mountain, jumping over in the sea
When my Daddy stay out late he don't care a thing for me

Mmmnn, mmmn
Mmmmn, mmmn

Daddy, daddy, please come home to me
Daddy, daddy, please come home to me
I'm on my way, crazy as I can be
