Tell me if I'm on my way to paradise
Does it mean I need to make a sacrifice?
Maybe you're right, maybe it's rong
Nothing left for me to do but carry on

You tell me that I'm on the road to ecstasy
And everything I want is waiting there for me
How will I know, Why should i care
Doesn't really matter how you get me there

And I wonder, if I
Just wasted all my time
I wonder, I wonder, will I make it home

Before I fall, And lose it all
Will I run or will i crawl, and take it all
Sometimes I wonder

Tell me if I fall will you be there for me
Or would you walk away without a care for me
Maybe I won't, maybe you will
Maybe you're just looking for some time to kill

I wonder, if I
Just wasted all my time
I wonder, I wonder
Will I stand alone

Before I fall, And lose it all
Will I run or will i crawl, and take it all
Sometimes I wonder

Before I fall, And lose it all
Will I run or will i crawl, and take it all
Sometimes I wonder
