Hey Bobby would you like to go for a ride
In the country with me?
I'm celebratin' ya see the four-wheeled beauty
You're leanin' on it finally belongs to me

I've never owned a car before
And I've never picked a boy up at his own front door
It'd be a red letter day
If you'll come out and play in the country with me

Hey Bobby will you ride a little ways down 299
To a lovely little spot I found? It's on a hilltop
We can park in the shade and dance on the ground
To a radio station where the hits don't ever stop

Watch the sun go down, see the moon rise up
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup
Rock the night away, lookin' at stars
Talkin' 'bout cars Bobby, with me

Hey Bobby do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Huh?

Watch the sun go down, see the moon rise up
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup
In future times that be
When ya need a good memory, Bobby think about me

Hey, Bobby do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?

How 'bout it Bobby?
Ya wanna go for a ride in the country?
I'll get ya back real early, trust me

Let me know it
Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
