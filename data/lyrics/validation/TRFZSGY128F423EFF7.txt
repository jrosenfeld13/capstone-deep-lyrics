Road runs west
There's a cliff at the edge of the wide, wide ocean down below
You sit and you smile, but it's cold as ice
And you wait for the sun to come
I wish I was a sailing man
Just riding out on these waves
And all these hopes and dreams, yeah, baby
I'm hoping that they stay, I'm hoping that they stay
Silver light, I don't want to fight
Just want someone to take my place
You say you're fine, you just need some time
I need some time
I wish I was a sailing man
Just riding out on these waves
And all these hopes and dreams, yeah, darling
I'm hoping that they stay, I'm hoping that they stay
