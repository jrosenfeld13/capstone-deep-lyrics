Jesu my lord
Won't you hear this cryin' soul
Messiah so kind
Won't you save this child of mine
Jo Jo oh my Jo Jo
Jo Jo he's my beautiful boy
He's my beautiful boy

And if he should die hold him near to you
'Cause my Jo Jo he's just a new born babe
Jo Jo oh my Jo Jo
Jo Jo you're such a beautiful boy
You're such a beautiful boy
