In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future

Cracking all like it's a game
But you never, never care
Cracking all that's in the air
So, my friend, beware

In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
Lies the future, lies the future
In the distance lies the future

All the sights in cyberation
All your stars in figuration
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future
In the distance lies the future

Mercy, mercy, mercy
In the distance, in the distance lies the future

You may try to get yourself there
But try to get the other way here
You may try to get yourself there
But try to get the other way here
In the distance lies the future

Hold the cows, it's a sound from outer space
In the distance lies the future

Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
In the distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance
Distance, distance, distance, distance

In the distance lies the future
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
