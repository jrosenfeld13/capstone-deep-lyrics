Why do you keep messin' with my mind
When I've told you
That what you're doing ain't gettin' through?
Why do you keep singing that same old line
Saying I love you
But still you're doing the things you do?
I get a warning when the season's gonna change
And I know grey matter is another name for brains
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
I'm spent, you win
I'm gonna give you up for Lent

Why do you keep me worried all the time
When it's evident
That the spirit can't be bent?
Why must you send bad vibes my way
Because what goes around
Is gonna come to you one day
Even when it's cloudy doesn't mean it's gonna rain
I know yellow taxis ain't no horse and buggy chain
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
I"m spent you win
I'm gonna give you up for Lent

If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
If you keep it up, I"m gonna give you up
