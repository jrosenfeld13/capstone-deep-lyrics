Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

I didn't show up today
I only disappeared
A missing detail
Of how I should feel

The memory has been erased
Yeah
If you really want to escape
You don't belong here

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

Oh

Turn the lights out
And be on your own
Outside your window
They'll be watching you now

The memory has been erased
Yeah
They were honouring you all to kill

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

Oh

I
I found it in the air
I saw it in the air

The sound
It sounded like it's there
You fall around the air

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think
