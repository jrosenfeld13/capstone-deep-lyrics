I was drunk when I met you
I was drunk when you walked out the door
And I rolled around the night
To find you
But I guess you never knew
Yeah you needed something solid
You could hold
Like a dog that came when you called
Like a coatstand that sits out in the hall
But you don't need me

It's your feet you don't need
Always facin' back the way you just came
I don't love you anymore
I don't need you
I'm just keepin' the score
You said life is too short to be bored
All this crawlin' around the floor
Won't get you what you want
It's just a waste
And you don't need me

So I look at every woman
Just to see if there's something there
For me
And I look up every moment
Just to know if I'm missing something
Sweet
And I need something solid I can hold
Like a dog that comes when I call
Like a brick I can throw against the wall
But I don't need you
Yeah I don't need you...
