I can count angels flying on by
I can count clouds now flying the sky
I can count the bad things good
And now blue
Swans are flying
And I've got to get used to
Get yourself off
Take a left at Verdugo
I'll be there as soon as I can
Look inside me or in your evil
Turn at the red gate
I'm waiting for you

(Chorus)
You're tearing me apart my friend
Bringing me down
Over and over again
You hurt my soul
And you wreck my world
Bringing me down over a friend
Get yourself off
Get yourself off
I'll be there just as soon as I can
You're tearing me apart my friend
Bringing me down
Over and over again
You hurt my soul
And you wreck my world
Bringing me down over a friend
Hold, hold your dreams up high
Shoot into space and glorify
The need for everything that's round
It takes me on down
You're tearing me apart my friend
Bringing me down
Over and over again
You hurt my soul
And you wreck my world
Bringing me down over a friend

(Chorus out...)
