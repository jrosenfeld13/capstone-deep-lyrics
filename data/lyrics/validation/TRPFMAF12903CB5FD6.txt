Take my heart I lay it down
At the feet of You who is crowned
And take my life I'm letting go
I lift it up to You, who is throned

Take my fret take my fear
All I have I'm leaving here
Be all my hopes be all my dreams
Be all my delights be my everything
Be my everything

And I will worship
You Lord only You Lord
And I will bow down
Before You only You Lord
Only You Lord

Take my heart I lay it down
At the feet of You Who's crowned
And take my life I'm letting go
I lift it up to You, to you Who is throned
To you Who is throned Jesus

And it's just You and me here now
And It's just You and me here now
And it's just You and me Lord
It's just You and me Lord
It's just You and me here now
