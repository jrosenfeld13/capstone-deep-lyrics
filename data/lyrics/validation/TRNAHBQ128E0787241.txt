Take me home for the ride
I won't be alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't be alone
We won't be alone tonight
I am standing in the shadows of the garden
Confessing to the pale moon above
If I tell you how I feel
You might harden
I'm scared of being lonely
And of dying without love

Take me home for the ride
I won't cry alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't cry alone
We won't cry alone tonight

I need everything I know you could provide me
But every time I love the flower dies
There's a darkness in the air
That seems to guide me
If you want to see the heartache
You can look into my eyes

Take me home for the ride
I won't die alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight

Sometimes our emotions make it hard
For us to see that
At the heart of loving is respect and honesty
And sometimes I'm afraid that I give
Less than I should give
But this time I will hold you
For as long as I live

I won't die alone
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight
