White lies...
I ain't gonna sing the same old songs again
I ain't gonna wage the same old wars
Don't wanna plead the same old promises
Ain't gonna see the same old sores

It's easier to say it
Harder still to execute
Each defines her own sense of divine
Not gonna let it out
Till I find something better

I don't wanna live this way
Because it tears me away from you
When I feel the hopelessness
I'm all alone in a crowded room
Every step I take, I keep walking the same old road
Gotta cut the cord, keep digging till I can
Find me something tangible

White lies
Don't wanna fear the same old failure
Don't want to bleed the blues
Ain't gonna lose the same old lover
Don't wanna steer the same old suit

It's easier to say it
Harder still to execute
Each defines their own sense of divine
I'm not gonna let it out
Till I find something better

I don't wanna live this way
Because it tears me away from you
And when I feel the loneliness
I'm alone in a crowded room
Every step I take
I keep walking the same old road
I gotta cut the chord
Keep digging till I can
Find me something tangible

Keep breathing, baby, keep breathing
Keep breathing, oh god, baby, just keep breathing
Said you found something better
Said you found somebody better
Now it's time to go and find your own way home
I know i'm gonna find it better, just keep breathing for me

I don't wanna live this way
'cause it tears me away from you
When I feel the hopelessness
I'm alone in a crowded room
Every step I take
I keep walking the same old road
I gotta cut the chord
And keep digging till I can
Find me something tangible
