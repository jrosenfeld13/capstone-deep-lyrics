I was look and it was clear to me
Thats i wasn't home anymore
And i was seeing things i'd never seen before
Turned around and shut the door
Checking out it's 11 am
Get in the van we're gonna do it again
Living my dream, so should you
You got one lifetime to do what you do
I'm living free
No worries just memories
I'm driving a long way back to you
Set it up we're playing again
Another chance to make new friends
I think i can do this forever
Pack it up the night is still young
We got plenty of time to have some fun
Everybody's asking where the party's at
Some will stay in, some will get wrecked
If i get out of hand and you know that it's true
Gonna pick up the pieces and see this through
Because in this land of temptation 'ya gotta be strong
Need your friends to help you along
I'm living free
No worries just memories
I'm driving a long way back to you
Set it up we're playing again
Another chance to make new friends
I think i can do this forever
I'm living free
No worries just memories
I'm driving a long way back to you
Set it up we're playing again
Another chance to make new friends
I think i can do this forever
