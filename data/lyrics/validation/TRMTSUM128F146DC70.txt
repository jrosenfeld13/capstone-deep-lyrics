[Verse 1]

Close to madness
So demanding, I can't breathe anymore
I'll never be the same again
Please forgive me and forget me
'Cause it's calling my name
I'll never go back again, back again, back again, back again

[Chorus]

Can I find some more misery?
If it can't be you, then it must be me and
Can I find some more for me?
I'll never know, I'll never go back again, back again, back again, back again

[Verse 2]

Cold September, I remember
Wishing I was away
I'll never be the same again
Please forgive me and forget me
Cause it's calling my name, it's calling, it's calling, it's calling, it's calling

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Time to time it gets easier
Time to time it gets easier again, again, again, again

[Chorus]
