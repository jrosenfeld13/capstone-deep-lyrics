Lonely is the night
Now that darkness has fallin'
Nothing seems right
And the world is callin'

Everybody's looking back
As the wind comes whispering by
The're waitin' for the answers then
Like the time they heard a cry

Hang on
Don't ever go
Life's here
I know

Wind called on me
How it took me by surprise
Cause night come upon me
Creeping through the distant skies

Wind tell me what you can
'Bout the life - What I came from
A breeze blew and whispered then
In a voice rich as the sun

Hang on
Don't ever go
Life's here
I know
