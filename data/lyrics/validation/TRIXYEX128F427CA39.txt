[Verse 1]
Sometimes they move faster
Faster than our eyes can tell the morning
Can tell the morning
Some ways for us to test
Each day we say our prayers for you

[Chorus]
These are the days that we came home
Hoping for the best
These are the days that we came home again
And I have to say that I love you
And I love you still

[Verse 2]
This lie is coming out
Breaking bonds that hold us
Throwing stones that hurt us
You cried, you tried
To tell us what we want to hear
Is it something that you fear?

[Chorus]
These are the days that we came home
Hoping for the best
These are the days that we came home again
And I have to say that I love you
And I love you still
This is ever true

After all you said, did you think it through?

These are the days that we came home
Hoping for the best
These are the days that we came home again
And I have to say that I love you
And I love you still
This is ever true
