And she curls her fingers
And shakes like a baby
She's always been
Uneasy in the dark

She twists like a radio
The frequencies weaving
The sanctuary of her restless mind
And she takes one more breath
From the diving bell

She floats by the window
A dress hung out on the line
She's always been weak in the knees
She bends like a photograph
The chemicals bleeding
And trades her courage for the tie that binds
Her to take one more breath
From the diving bell

Finally asleep she is sold
Each breath for a handsome price
Lying hand in hand, side by side
A woman and her sacrifice

She twists like a radio
An ocean of static
Endlessly drowning
A heart designed
To take one more breath
From the diving bell
And she takes one more breath
From the diving bell
