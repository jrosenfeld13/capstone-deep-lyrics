I was asked to get away
Shut my mouth, forget what I saw
Be the fool
It's something I can do quite well, thank you
I walk away, obliterated
But sedated with the fact
That I've retained my sanity
And that is something that you've forsaken

Now you won't see me act unkind
Unless you beg to be treated that way

Remember when you were young
You were the one with the most scars
Remember what is done is done
Even if it hurts in the worst way

You won't see me act unkind
Unless you beg to be treated that way
Because I will

Never to be the one, the only one
Smiling at the end
Never to see the sun without the pain
In your eyes
Under the catastrophic moon
Under the catastrophic moon
