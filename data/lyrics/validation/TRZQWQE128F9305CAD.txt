[Verse]
Hey there
How are you?
It's been a long time
It seems like we've come a long way
My, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come
And they go
And leave us behind as if
We're supposed to know (why)
Oh, tell me (why)
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?

And all you wishing well fools
With your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend
It's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember places to go
Pretty maids all in a row

[Outro]
All in a row (Ooh)[x2]
