Now the hacienda's dark
The town is sleeping
Now the time has come to part
The time for weeping

Vaya con Dios, my darling
Vaya con Dios, my love

Now the village mission bells
Are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart
You'll hear them singing

Vaya con Dios, my darling
Vaya con Dios, my love

Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a prayer
A prayer to guide you
To hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through
A gray tomorrow
But the memories we share
Are there to borrow

Vaya con Dios, my darling
Vaya con Dios, my love

Vaya con Dios, my darling
Vaya con Dios, my love
