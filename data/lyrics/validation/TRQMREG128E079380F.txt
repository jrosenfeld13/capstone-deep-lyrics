I never had it
I never wanted it
I never had your beauty mark
Nor did I have your black hair and hazel eyes
My early childhood
Was not as simple
As yours set in the country
No I did not have a fear of nuns who dressed in black
But I do have your taste

I have no radio show
Nor did I have homemade clothes
Homemade curtains of the same material

I never had it
I never wanted it
I never had your beauty mark
Beauty mark

But I do have your taste
And I do have your red face and long hands

I think Callas sang a lovely Norma
You prefer Robeson in Deep River
I may not be so manly
But still I know you love me
Even if I don't have your beauty mark
Beauty mark
