All we fear gathers around us
With the eve of the night
This moment never-ending we will abide

Before last light
Before last light

Bright heartache clothed in shadow
Tears the soul but pain we carry along
We carry together to wear the dim

Before last light
Before last light
Before last light
Before last light

I want to fly far away all night long
I want to fly far away all night long
I want to fly far away

In this moment never-ending we will abide

Before last light
Before last light
Before last light
Before last light
