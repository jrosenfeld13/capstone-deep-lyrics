What would you say if receptors quit receiving?
Or if everything you believe, you quit believing?
What would you hold if you fell into the night and all the moments of your life flashed before your eyes?
What will save you now?
What grace will you find?
What a wasted life too quick for closed minds
One more pointless breath as you sail into the night
Take the pain with stride as we say goodbye
Too quick for closed minds
Just wasting all of your life searching for eternity
All youll find is apathy
