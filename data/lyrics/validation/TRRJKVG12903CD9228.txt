As tight as I can
Tonight she'll know

I say, well, meet me in a hurry
Behind the barn
Don't you be afraid, darling
I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring
Along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away
All my blues

There's good rocking tonight

Well, we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock
Let's rock. come on and rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rocking tonight
Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rocking tonight

As tight as I can
Well, tonight she'll know

I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock
Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away
