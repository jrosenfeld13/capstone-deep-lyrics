I want a color tv and a newspaper blocking the door
I want a credit card key and a new phonebook on the floor
I want a getaway map of the hallway
I want a bird's eye view of the Hyundai
So I can sleep sleep sleep, or maybe I'll just sit in the car

'Cause here there's no silence (so so simple, its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
Best thing is keep singing (so so simple, its)

I want a colorform theme and a vending machine down the hall
I want a ready-made bed and a passport safe in the wall
I want to have it just the way I couldn't give it
I want a life that lives the way we could have lived it
So I can sleep sleep sleep, or maybe I'll just sit in the car

But here there's no silence (so so simple, its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
Best thing is keep singing (so so simple, its)

But here there's no silence (so so simple, its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
There's no silence (so so simple its)
Best thing is keep singing (so so simple, its)

(so so simple, its)
(so so simple, its)
(so so simple, its)
Best thing is keep singing
