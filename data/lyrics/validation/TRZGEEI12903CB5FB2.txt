[Quote from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)]

I'm not just talking about my wife, I'm talking about my LIFE, I can't seem to get that through to you
I'm not just talking about one person, I'm talking about everybody. I'm talking about form. I'm talking about content
I'm talking about interrelationships. I'm talking about God, the devil, Hell, Heaven. Do you understand... FINALLY?

[Verse 1: Possessed]

Wake up and smell the bodies, can you take the stench?
I was bourne to kill like David Webb
Live on house on haunted hill
Where heretics burn at the stake like a Foreman grill (Ill)
Death defying
My spirit is Satans most sought after collectors item
Rule universe and beyond
Got a poetic license to kill, word is my bond
(Fire at will) shoot off at the mouth
Connor McCloud bringing Apocalypse Now
Want the same deal that was offered to Faust
Got precincts screaming Officer Down!
Its every man for himself
Im Gambit, hit the deck when I play the hand I was dealt
Explosion
My opponents talk tough, but wouldnt harm a Jeff Goldblum

[Verse 2: Psiklone]

I beat the odds 'till I'm breaking even
A raging demon, driving crucifixes into pagan heathens
Typhonic raining season
Free fall without my heart rate increasing or a change in my pace of breathing
Skin coated in solar panels
Absorb the sun's energy, radiate golden shadows
Colder than frozen polar mammals
Faster than bows and arrows and bullets leaving revolver barrels
Rush back for revenge
Speed camera screen apertures cave in and shatter the lens
Hang upside down inside a churches steeple
Suspended in pits of hypodermic needles
My saliva burns cathedrals to sand
Write two different verses at the same time with each of ma hands
Born an unstoppable force
A tropical storm, freestyling the oracle's thoughts locked in a hospital ward
