Well im a sucker for some pretty eyes but they're going home with some other boy tonight
Hell, i guess i'll be fine cause there's one girl that's all mine
She's seen it before
She'll see it again
Cause that other girls going home with him
And come back to her and she don't mind
She's my best girl
She's got six strings and she knows all about these heart breakin things
No her might eyes might not shine, she's always by my side
Hell, she's all mine for all night
She's my best girl by far
Shes all mine for all night
And she'll never break my heart
She don't care if i come home late
Or if i don't come home after seven long days
She knows that i'm hers and she knows to wait
She knows those other girls just won't last
She knows i'll always come on back.. to her
She's all that i've got
She's my best girl
She's got six strings and she knows all about these heart breakin things and no her eyes might not shine
Shehe 's always by my side
Hell she's all mine for all night
She's my best girl by far
She's all mine for all night
The only girl a boy can trust is his guitar
She's my best girl
She's got six strings and she knows all about these heart breakin things and no her eyes might not shine
She's always by my side
No her eyes might not shine, but atleast shes all mine
