I see the tables turning
They turn with speed
I watch the fire burning
Burning to the sea
I heard a holy story
I laughed out loud
A man who chases the wind
Never should be proud
They can always find a way
To pull you down
Make you feel so small invisible
Another sent to take the final part of me
Give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
Fill me with hope and quickly betray
When i am barely breathing
They come for me
I wish i never saw them
Walk all over me
They can always find a way to pull you down
Make you feel so small invisible
Another sent to take the final part of me
Give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
Fill me with hope and quickly betray
It's my fault
I should have never trusted
It never fails
To bring me down
So hear me out
Always busted
You got yours
Guess i got mine
Your high score
My waste of time
Give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
Fill me with hope and quickly betray
Give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
Fill me with hope and quickly betray
