The days were golden
We were known to be
We won't escape this memory
Forward on, to the place we sail

All to believe
When you raise an iron hand
This place without a song for all
The words just crawl

Glimmering and everything, another skull
You said it was dangerous
Found out the place where you were going
Follow me down the path
I take your hopes, I promise you this
A dying, cold world, but gold
Shimmering gold

Come mama now, tell me the story
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland
Devoured, torn into pieces
Come now, we shine
Small things ever calling out your name
You hear some other time
Unchained, alive
A world undefined

All to be free
When you raise an open hand
This place without a wall
The words just grow

Glimmering and everything, another skull
You said it was dangerous
Found out the place where you were going
Follow me down the path
I take your hopes, I promise you this
A dying, cold world, but gold
Shimmering gold

Come mama now, tell me the story
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland
Devoured, torn into pieces
Come now, we shine
Small things ever calling out your name
You hear some other time
Unchained, alive
A world undefined
