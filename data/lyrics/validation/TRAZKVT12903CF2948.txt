Fountain, fountain
We are the same
Fountain, fountain
We are the same

You with the water, and me with the pain
Turning it over again and again

Don't you wish you could throw your pennies back at them?
Don't you wish you could throw your pennies back at them
Back at them
At them

Fountain, Fountain
We are the same
Fountain, Fountain
We are the same

All that anyone ever has for you
Are the things you reflect back to them

Don't you wish you could throw your pennies back at them?
Don't you wish you could throw your pennies back at them?
Back at them
At them

Fountain, fountain
We are the same
Fountain, fountain
We are the same

It is so beautiful how you remain
