Boy in the rain (boy in the rain)
Finally decides (finally decides)
Too long has he been unkind

Boy in a daze (boy in a daze)
Finds that she's gone (finds that she's gone)
How could he have been so wrong?

Now she's gone, he sighs
Understanding in his eyes
Like the end of a dream
He won't believe

Girl in the rain (girl in the rain)
Feeling unsure (feeling unsure)
In this is what she'd hoped for

Girl in a daze (girl in a daze)
Finds that it's she (finds that it's she)
Who's feeling so bad, not he

Now she's gone, she sighs
Understanding in her eyes
Like the end of a dream
She won't believe

And the birds aren't singing anymore
And the birds aren't singing anymore
And the birds aren't singing anymore
And the birds aren't singing anymore, anymore

Now she's gone, they sigh
Understanding in their eyes
Like the end of a dream
They won't believe
