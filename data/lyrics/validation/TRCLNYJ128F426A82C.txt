In your dreams
They bring you nightmares
You youth is like a creepin' disease!
Dirty games
You have to suffer
Share your secret with your father!
You ain't old enough to understand
What your father does with his filthy hand
Submissive you do what they say
Cause they misuse you anyway!
Mistreated - children of pain
Mistreated - resistance in vain
You are scared
To sleep at night
Cause your daddy holds you more that tight!
You ain't old enough to understand
What your father does with his filthy hand
Submissive you do what they say
Cause they misuse you anyway!
Mistreated - children of pain
Mistreated - resistance in vain
Mistreated - children of pain
Mistreated - resistance in vain
