Well, the moon sank as the wind blew
And the street lights slowly died
Yeah they call you the wild one
Said stay away from her
Said she couldn't love no one if she tried

But then something I saw in your eyes
Told me right away
That you were going to have to be mine
The strangest feeling came over me down inside
No matter what it takes
I'll never get over how good it felt
When you finally held me
I will never regret baby
Those few hours linger on in my head forever

Well it's too bad but I want you
To know I understand
Yeah it's been a long time
But I don't mind, yeah it's all right
I understand

(Chorus)
