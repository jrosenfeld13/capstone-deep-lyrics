We've got to find a place to be on our own
The wind from somewhere east will take us back home

We, have our destination
He, doesn't know we just go on

There is another day when he will be gone
Until that time will come we'll just carry on

He, makes no conversation
He, will be there sometime, somewhere

All of us, take it slow
From the back roads to the highway we will go
All of us, getting near
Got to find a place

There is no ending to the game that we play
The first goodbye for us is lost far away

Now, we are all together
How, can you say he won't be long?

All of us, take it slow
From the back roads to the highway we will go
All of us, getting near
Got to find a place
