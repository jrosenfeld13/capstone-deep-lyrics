I see, the sun will turn Blood-red it changes over me For three days I
Suffered the poisonous gold Made Cyrus the God-sent King Oh memories of old

For too long I faded For too long I shared the vagueness of spirits
...faded so fast The memories eluded me or else brought me pain The
Cauldron still hurts me, see again, and again..

My Bones in a shrine My soul still caught in time May she burn have I no
Soul I'm Azriel

Oh, do believe my Masters I've slain Oh, no, but you needn't fear Jonathan
My friend There's been too many Masters too many deaths by my hand The
Memories of innocense All tears in the sand

My Bones in a shrine My soul still caught in time May she burn have I no
Soul I'm Azriel
And so you see, the sun will turn Blood-red it changes over me Wrought in
Confusion My life at an end I wait for the golden stairs To come down again
