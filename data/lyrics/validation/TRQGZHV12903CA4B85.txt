Sweet Jamaica man a I and I land that
Me no stop love it
And me know the whole massive love it
And them respect it to man, hear this
Help me big up Jamaica
The land of wood and water
The systems might no proper
But we love the vibes the food and the culture
Woi, can't you see
The beauty of this country
Me never know a serious thing
Until me reach a foreign

(Chorus:)
Say what a nice place fi live, sweet Jamdown
The only problem is, dollars nah run
What a nice place fi live, sweet Jamdown
The only problem is, dollars nah run
Now with the money inna you pocket
And God inna you heart
Crowd of people, what more you want
Reggae music a play, reggae artists a chant
A yah so me born and me nah transplant

(Chorus)
A man will let pon a banana boat
And him gone aboard
Because him say every weh better than yard
But when him touch certain countries
See the system of fraud
Him haffi run back a Jamdown
And give it its reward

(Chorus)
Yah so me born, yah so me come from
Yen so me live, and yah me intend fi tan
Regardless of the economic condition
You must admit this is a glorious land

(Chorus)
Help me big up Jamaica
The land of wood and water
The systems might no proper
But we love the vibes the food and the culture
Woi, can't you see
The beauty of this country
Me never know a serious thing
Until me reach a foreign

(Chorus)
As a Jamaican, my argument is
Whoever say them clever
Them fi stop the promises
And just, mass production
In all the parishes
And Jamdown will progress
Like all the countries

(Chorus)
Jamaica and Jamaicans are extremely great
Appreci-love and even some say appreciate
Well since we know that make we concentrate
On how fi make the dollars start circulate

(Chorus)
From money inna you pocket
And God inna you heart
Crowd of people, what more you want
Reggae music a play, reggae artists a chant
A yah so me born and me nah transplant

(Chorus)
