Time after time
You and your kind
Send shivers up and down my spine
Apathy flows in the candle light
Heaven won't help you
Energy might
Tune to your radio
Communication's on

Time after time
I see the signs
I'd hold my breath and look away
I don't care what the newspapers say
I'm gonna do what I do anyway
In this age of communication
I'm just not getting through

Man-made radio
Speak out in the time that it takes for a warning
Right or wrong you'll know by the morning
Can't keep losing sleep
When the man comes asking questions I'll be gone
'Cos you're better off being alone in the dark
In this age of information

Alone in the dark in this age of information
Turn to your radio for further explanation

You've seen the danger
You've heard the news
You've had messages coming through
I don't care what the newspapers say
I'm gonna do what I do anyway
In this age of communication
I'm just not getting through

They're not losing sleep-sweet dreams
They don't care if the world falls to pieces
They just speak for the speechless
Can't tell wrong from right
You know it's a mess of approximation
In this age of information
