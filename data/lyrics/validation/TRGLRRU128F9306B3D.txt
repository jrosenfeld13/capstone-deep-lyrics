It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
It's all right sisters
It's all right brother

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
It's all right brother
It's all right

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
It's all right sisters
It's all right brother

The wheel within the wheel
The water below the well
Keep the curtain drawn and the record on
And be careful what do you say

Bring the bottle here
Make the real unreal
And let's go out and play

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
We all get down sometimes

Starting to show me
Starting to know me
Starting to feel the shine
Starting to let go
Now that we know
Time to move it on down the line

The exit marks the hex
That moves from next to next

Keep your head on tight
To make it thru the night
You got to make a friend along the way
So cover up your tracks
And avoid a tax
And you'll live to love another day

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
We all get down sometimes

Starting to show me
Starting to know me
Starting to feel the shine
Starting to let go
Now that we know
Time to move it on down the line

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
We all get down sometimes

Starting to show me
Starting to know me
Starting to feel the shine
Starting to let go
Now that we know
It's time to move it on down the line

Yeah, it's time to move it on down the line
It's time to move it on down the line
It's time to move it on down the line
It's time to move it on down the line
Move on
