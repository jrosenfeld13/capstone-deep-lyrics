Where did you go my traveling son?
Where do you lay your bones when the day is done?
Its been so long since I held you, since I held you in my arms
I'm searching the midnight sky to find your falling star

And over the weary land they all know you by name
So make me proud, boy, and set their souls aflame

I put you above all the dread and all the fear
With your mother's love I'll ease all the pain
The pain of ten thousand long years
Since you've been gone I hear what people say
But they're thinking of you boy when they tremble, when they sin and when they pray

And over the weary land they all know you by name
So make me proud, boy, and set their souls aflame

Come on home, come on home
Come on home, come on home

And over the weary land they all know you by name
So make me proud, boy, and set their souls aflame
Make me proud boy, make me proud boy
Make me proud boy, then come on home
Come on home, please come home...
