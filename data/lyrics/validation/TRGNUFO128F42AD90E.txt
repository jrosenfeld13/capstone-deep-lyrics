There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life and I know it will bring me home

There's a choir singing
With a force that can light the sky
I will join with voice deep inside
Anthems for joys gone by and for joys I'm sure will come

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
Why my heart sings of golden things

There's a dove ascending
Like my thoughts in the summer sky
And she carries my soul along
Clear to eternity and I know I'm not alone

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
Why my heart sings of golden things

There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life and I know it will bring me home
