I said upside down you're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Instinctively you give to me
The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you

Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheatin'
When no-one makes me feel like you do

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

I know that you go charm and appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy to think you are mine

As long as the sun
Continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you that's the bottom line

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Instinctively you give to me
The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you

Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheatin'
When no-one makes me feel like you do

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out
And round and round

Upside down you're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me
I say to see respectfully

Upside down you're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me
I say to see respectfully

I said upside down you're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me
I say to see respectfully

Upside down you're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me
I say to see respectfully

Upside down you're turnin' me
