Woken by lifeless moonlight
Abandoned by dream and night
All awake but still inside
Trapped behind words too sublime

Desperation is long dead
I am lost and I am damned
To watching the world go by
Without a trace, without a smile
...Wake me up...

My voice drowns in tears
As I left go of your hand and tell you to leave
Still I'm choking on unsought thoughts
Shapeless ghosts of old memories

Desperation is long dead...

...I need to break away
I need to break away or die
This pain is too real and alive
Suffocating from the inside

I wish I knew another way out
Another time and place
Another life to face

Suddenly it all became so clear
It's so easy not to care
So easy to let go...

'Cause it's in my blood
Flowing through my veins and I've no way out of this now
But maybe just maybe the other side will welcome me
Into the darkness I yearn
Into a frail infinity
Void of self and memory...
But you my darling will stay and realize
That you are so lost now
Just watching the world go by
Without a trace, without a smile

...Wake me up
