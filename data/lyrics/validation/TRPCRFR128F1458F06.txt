I've only known you for a while
And there's 27 ways to make you smile
But I know now what's going in your mind
And only time will tell the fool who criticized

Yeah, yeah, because I know now what you're saying
And it ain't gonna happen to me
Because I gotta gotta go, it's harder for me
And then I'll see you before it happens to me
And I've gotta gotta go

It's only hard the way it looks
It's harmful when you read six good books
But I know now what's going out in your mind
And only time will tell the fool who criticized

Yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I know now what you're saying
And it ain't gonna happen to me
'Cause I've got to gotta go, it's harder for me
And then I'll see you before it happens to me
And I've got to gotta go

Yeah, oh yeah

And then I'll see you before it happens to me
And I've got to gotta go before it happens to me
And then I'll see you before it happens to me
And I've got to gotta go

Yeah, yeah
