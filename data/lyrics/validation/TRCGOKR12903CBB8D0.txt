I feel so lonely I can't stop thinking of you
The years we had meant nothing now
Tell me what can I do, I feel so lonely
Can't stop thinking of you

The love we shared is over now
Tell me what can I do
Another nights passed, you haven't called again
I always thought we would be much more than friends

Six years we've had and our love has gone away
I used to look forward to our wedding day
I gave you my heart, my body and my soul
I gave it all to you, now I lost control

You said you feel the same, that I was to blame
You're just not ready to make that one big change

I feel so lonely I can't stop thinking of you
The years we had meant nothing now
Tell me what can I do, I feel so lonely
Can't stop thinking of you

There's been talk about taking me away
But now my tears cry like rain on a cloudy day
I never thought things could go so wrong
I never thought I would have to write this song

I gave you my heart, my body and my soul
I gave it all to you, now I lost control
You said you feel the same, that I was to blame
You're just not ready to make that one big change

I feel so lonely I can't stop thinking of you
The years we had meant nothing now
Tell me what can I do, I feel so lonely
Can't stop thinking of you

Feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Feel so lonely, feel so lonely

I feel so lonely I can't stop thinking of you
The years we had meant nothing now
Tell me what can I do, I feel so lonely
Can't stop thinking of you
