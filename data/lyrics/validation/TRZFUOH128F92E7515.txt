I tried to tell you but I couldnt find a word
Maybe, I did and you misunder stood

I guess, I thought it better for never we should be
I waited too long now, Im bound for Tennes see

Theres no use wonderin`
Things are never what they seem
No sense in turning round
Looking back won't change a thing

That ship is sailing
Its gone out on the sea
I waited too long
Now Im bound for Tennessee

And when I am gone
Even long gone better, yeah
I won't forget you
Hear your voice in my head

I missed my chance to tell you
How much you meant to me
I waited too long
Now Im bound for Tennessee

Promised not to call you
And I won't write you anymore
I lived that good life
Isnt that what livins for?

Its not the going
Its the staying that worries me
Cause I waited too long
Now, Im bound for Tennessee

Yes, we waited too long
