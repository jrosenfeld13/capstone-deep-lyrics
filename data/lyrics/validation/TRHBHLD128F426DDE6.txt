A sunny day, cruise control
A couple trees, a smooth road
The weather changed, a little rain
A hidden curve, a flattened brain

I knew her once, just a friend
She helped me out, I loved her then
But she got tired, and I got cold
The weather changed, and love got old

After that, she called me up
She say I'm sorry, and I'd hang up
I saw her once, some parking lot
I smiled, I waved, she did not

Now she's gone and I don't know when
I loved her more, I loved her then
I loved her then
