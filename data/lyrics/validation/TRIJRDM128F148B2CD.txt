[Verse 1]
So many places
People to see
Dinners and parties
To fill up the week
But I'm scared like a baby
Of being alone
Of turning the lights off
With no one to hold (oh, no)
What I'm sure of
Is what it's gotta be

[Chorus]
I wanna go and make a baby with you
I wanna jump into the treehouse
But what we should do
Is we got to get together
Got to get together right

Ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh, ooh
La, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Diamonds and peacocks
Lining the street
I'm talking to strangers
And they're talking to me
I'm scraping the crystals
Out of the sack
Life is a yo-yo
And family's a drag (I know)
But what I'm sure of
Is what I wanna be

[Chorus]
I wanna go and make a baby with you
I wanna crash into the open arms
What we do is we got to get together
Got to get together right

Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh

Find me, find me

[Breakdown]
Ah-oooh, ooh, ooh!
Ah-oooh, ooh, ooh!
Alright!

Whatever we do
Is we've got to get together
Got to get together right

That's what it's gotta be!

I'm just so happy I can be here with you
I wanna go and make a baby
What we should do
Is we got to get together
Got to get together right

Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh

Gotta get together right now
