Sweet is the sight
Of her room
Window open by candle light
How would you know
Cold winter on the shore
Chills the dress she wore
It's on the floor
Still it feels so warm
Today

And that's why i'm wondering
Why you had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time
When you don't have to run

And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You never hear her
The way that i do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and let's you down
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you

Swing into flight
Over hills
Over her hills it's twilight
Yeah i guess that's right now
And while we're here, tell me
Why it's so funny
That you're so funny
When you're mad
Cause it's mad, so mad

And thats why i'm wondering
Why you had to tell me
What's going on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time
When you don't have to run

And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You never hear her
The way that i do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and let's you down
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you

I don't know where you're coming from
And i don't know where you're coming to
And i don't know what it means to me
And you don't know what it means to you

She doesn't mean you
