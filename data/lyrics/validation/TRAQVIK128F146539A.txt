There is not a river wide
Not a mountain high
And neither sin nor evil
Could change how I feel inside
Could change how I feel inside
Not all the strength of the ocean
Not all the heat from the sun, from the sun
Now, others have tried, I just can't deny
For me you are the one
For me you are the one
The true love is priceless
For true love you pay a price
But there's nothing
Can keep me from loving you
Not fire, no not ice
Not fire, no not ice
Like a hero or a champion
You are the best, you're the best
Like religion or superstition
With you I am blessed
With you I am blessed
Now the river may grow wider
The mountain may reach past the sky
And whether or not you feel the same
My love shall never die
My love shall never die
True love is give and take
True love is sacrifice
But there's nothing
Can keep me from loving you
Not fire, no not ice
Not fire, no not ice
Not fire, no not, not ice
