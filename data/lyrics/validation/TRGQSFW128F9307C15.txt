[Verse 1]
Trust in me
I'll make you see everything inside the fire
Let us share all our secrets
I can take away the dire

[Chorus]
I will make you drown
I will let you fall so deep
I will see you frown
I will let you fall so deep into me

[Verse 2]
Fight me as now it's over
Hate me so I can forgive myself
Now I am crying
Will it be your fate to love and die?

[Chorus]
I will make you drown
I will let you fall so deep
I will see you frown
I will let you fall so deep into me

[Redrain]
Forgive me, and die

[Chorus]
I will make you drown
I will let you fall so deep
I will see you frown
I will let you fall so deep into me

[Outro]
I will make you drown (in me)
I will make you drown (in me)
I will make you drown (in me)
I will make you drown (in me)
