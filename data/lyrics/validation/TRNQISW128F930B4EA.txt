The prayer of Death

Toll the bell

Call on them to toll the bell again

Tell them sing a little song like this :

Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand
If I never, never see you any more
Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand
I'll meet you on that other shore

I got his word, etc

I'm satisfied, etc

I have a right, etc

I done left over here, etc
I'll meet you on that kingdom shore

I got his word, etc

Now here my hand, etc

Here where I hear old reverend (?) that stopped and went in prayer. Now hear him calling the Lord : "Oh Lord, oh Lordy."
