[Chorus:]
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

[Verse 1:]
I'm under a spell again
Boy, I'm wondering why
This is not a game of love
But an emotional tie

I'm trying to figure out my heart (heart...)
But I can't offer you proof
Of why we should never be apart

And that is the
(That is the)
That is the truth
Oh...

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Do you know why I stop and stare
And smile when you walk by
And how I call you up at night
I hang up the phone and I cry

If I never got to know you so well
(I knew you well)
Maybe I would be fine

Baby, you know that I can't tell
Why you should be
(You should be)
You should be mine, oh

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ooh
I know what you're thinking
I see it in your eyes

You want to give
Our love another try
I'm so glad you realize
I can't...

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Rap:]
Shake it
Your love
Can't shake
Just can't shake your love

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
