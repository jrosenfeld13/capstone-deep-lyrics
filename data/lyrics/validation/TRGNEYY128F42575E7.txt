In my sleep
I heard her voice so clearly
Whispering my name
I know that she was here

Walked the streets
Trying to leave her ghost behind me
I saw her face
In everything so clear

In the city streets around me
In the things I left behind me
In the sky that does surround me
Everywhere she's all around me
She's all around me

Forget your dreams
Forget the very nature of your dreams
Has gone away
She's living with the straights of yesterday

Forget yourself
Forget the very essence of yourself
Has gone away
Remember this she'll never see you through

Waiting for someone to take me to
Somewhere I won't leave behind me
Somewhere I won't leave behind me
Somewhere I won't leave behind me to

In my life
I've lost what I held dearly
Thrown it all away
There's nothing takes her place

I pace the bars
Trying to fill the hole inside me
She tore away
There's nothing in her place

In the city's filth around me
In the things I've left behind me
In the sky that does surround me
Everywhere she's all around me
She's all around me

Forget your dreams
Forget the very nature of your dreams
Has gone away
She's living in the blood of yesterday

Forget yourself
Forget the very essence of yourself
Has gone away
Remember this she'll never see you through

Waiting for some voice to make me to
Somewhere I won't leave behind me to
Somewhere I won't leave behind me to
Somewhere I won't leave behind me to

Everywhere she's all around me
Everywhere she's all around me
Everywhere she's all around me
Everywhere she's all around me

Forget your dreams
Forget the very essence of your dreams
Has gone away
You remember this she'll never see you through

She'll never
She'll never
She'll never see you through

She'll never
She'll never
She'll never see you through

She'll never
She'll never
She'll never see you through

She'll never
She'll never
She'll never see you through
