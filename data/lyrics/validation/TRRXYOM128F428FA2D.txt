No I still don't believe you
When I hear you say
You know things will be better
This way

No I still don't believe you
When you tell me goodbye
And after you put the phone down
I am here hanging on the line

You say all these days apart
Will mend my broken heart
But I still don't believe you

All the mistakes we made
Were like the work of a child
And I know we would grow wiser
If we just let it age a while

Cause it feels like you have made me
Into something new
Someone to believe in
But I forget myself when I don't have you

You say all these days apart
Will mend my broken heart
All these days apart
Will mend my broken heart
You say I don't want to be like everybody else
Cruel to you and hating myself
I don't want to learn to live with it
This everyday unkindness

But I still don't believe you
No I still don't believe you
I don't want to hear you
Still don't believe you
