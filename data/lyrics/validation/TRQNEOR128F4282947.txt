Am I sad
Not sad enough really
Am I mad
Not mad enough clearly
Am I
Complacent
Completely
Lacking in sincerity
Yes indeed I am
Am I tough
Not tough enough really
Am I rough
Not rough enough nearly
Am I lying here
On the ground
Watching you get pushed around
Yes indeed I am
Really
I don't know why
I'm such a wimp
I realize
I'm just your pimp
But what can I do
What can I do

Am I small
Not small enough really
I feel lame and cirumspect
I feel your pain and yet
I feel sympathy
Empathy
It's just that I'm super busy right now
Really

I don't know why
I'm such a shit
I realize
This doesn't help a bit
But what can I do
What can I do

Am I bad
Not bad enough really
I feel angry and upset
I could write you a small check
Look I wish you luck
And here's you're buck
It's just that I'm a yuppie fuck
Yes indeed I am
Really
