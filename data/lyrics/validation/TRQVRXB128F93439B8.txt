Baby, you're making me want you
And baby, you're making me love you
We're in the city, city
Making me want you
We're in the city, city
Making me love you, making me care

Do doo doo... do doo doo doo..
Da da daa.. da daa.. da da..

Baby, you're making me want you (want you)
And baby, you're making me love you (love you)
We're in the city, city, making me want you (want you)
We're in the city, city, city, making me love you
Making me care

Do doo doo.. do doo doo doo...
Da daa daa.. da daa..
Do doo doo.. do doo doo doo..
Da daa daa... da daa..
Da daa

(Want you)
(Love you)
(Want you)

In the city your footsteps float in the air
In the city at night
There's no one else there
In the city see all the old street lamps again
In the city they took all the new ones away
You wind down a window to let in some light
Through the middle of glass and billboards at night
And pausing to catch your breath in the rain
In the city your home again
Again

Do doo doo... do doo doo doo..
Da daa daa.. da daa..
Do doo doo... do doo doo doo..
Da daa daa.. da daa..
Da daa..

Da daa..
