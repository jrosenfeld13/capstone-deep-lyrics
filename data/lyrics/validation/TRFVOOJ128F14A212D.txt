Said my freedom
Said please stay
Said I'd waited
Amma say
And I ran away from living
Thought I wanted it that way
Every step I should be given
But I'm stuck feeling just pain
But if that's how its gotta be
Can we love
We should pray
Can we trust
I'll go our way
If I knew why I'd be living except I wanted it that way
And I tried I'm always trying
And I wanted you to stay
But if that's how its gotta be
In my freedom
In my pain
Will it leave me
Amma say
And I wanted to believe in
That you wanted it that was
And my love has lost its feeling
And my love what should I say
And I tried to let you love me
And I wanted it that way
And I know you'll always love me
Can you please help make me stay
But if that's how its gotta be
To make me try to be
And I run away from living
Every step I should be giving
But I'm stuck feeling just pain
If I knew why I'd be living
Except I wanted it that way
And I tried I'm always trying
And I wanted you to say that's how its gotta be
