Livin' in the back of this car
How'd I wind up in this place
It never shoulda gotten this far
I was such a fool to run away
Can't Believe I'm diggin' thru this trash
Back at home I had a seat at the table
Only thing holdin' me back
Is my inability to be grateful

Today Ive finally had enough
I'm sick and tired of this kind of life
Listen to the voice inside

I'm on' roll like a freight train
Blow like a hurricane
Run like a mustang
Don't Stop For Anything

They say a Journey of a thousand miles
Starts when you take the first step
Travel for a little while
And you won't be coming back again

Lighten my load
Lighten my soul
Leave some things beside the road
Negativity, Pain and misery
Are all just considered history

I see, The storm is finally gone
The sun is rising on a brand new day
And now that I can see my way

I'm on' roll like a freight train
I'm' a' blow like a hurricane
Gonna run like a mustang
Don't stop, Don't stop for anything
I was meant to roll like a freight train
Gonna fly like a jet plane
Comin' back like a boomerang
I won't stop for anything

Today I've finally had enough
I'm sick and tired of this kinda life
I listen to the voice inside

I'm on' roll like a freight train
Gonna blow like a hurricane
Gotta run like a mustang
I won't stop, won't stop for anything

You gotta role like a freight train
Gonna fly like a jet plane
Comin through like a boomerang
I won't stop for anything

I'm comin through like a
A freight train, a freight train a hurricane
A mustang, a mustang, I won't stop
I won't stop for anything

I
