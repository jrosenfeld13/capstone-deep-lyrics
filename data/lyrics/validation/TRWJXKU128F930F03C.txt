Climb out of the pit
Join in the game
Fresh throats to slit, yeah
Tonight was made for pain

Flesh out of spirit
Come alive
Under the mutant sky
They wanna walk the earth

Underground, in the tomb
They rise with the moon
Gathering power

Waking the dead
Beating the thunder drums
Waking the dead
Now! Now!
Come on

From houses of ice
And halls out of time
Shadows are rising
Smoke eats the sky

Out of the fire
To choke
At the end of the rope
The dead will walk again

Underground, in the tomb
They're casting the runes
Gathering power

Waking the dead
Beating the thunder drums
Waking the dead
Now! Now!
Waking the dead
Beating the thunder drums
Waking the dead
Now! Now! Now!

Beyond all hunger
Beyond all pain
Come and get it

Flesh out of spirit born tonight
They wanna walk the earth

Underground, in the tomb
They rise with the moon
Gathering power

Waking the dead
Beating the thunder drums
Waking the dead
Now! Now!
Waking the dead
Beating the thunder drums
Waking the dead
Here they sine
Come and get it
