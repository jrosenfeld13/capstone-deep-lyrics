I am lost in the black chamber
There's no way to turn back
It takes me down forevermore
And death would be so sweet
I'm possessed by the old creature
Who had planned all
To take my soul
Too late for me

In my hands
It liest I thought
But I failed
Now he's in me

My soul is lost
In his black chamber

I'm gone
