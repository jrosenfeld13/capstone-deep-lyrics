Rain fell that day when the sky went black on everyone
These things we're told not to talk about, not to
Anyone
When You fell you took the fall for everything that I
Had ever done
So help me never forget just how beautiful the sky
Could be

You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain
And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same
Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my
Knees
And I can't explain, I can't explain any of this

It's coming down I close my eyes to feel the rain like
It could wash away a thousand years of heartbreak
So just a little, let the rain fall down
Oh oh oh oh
Wash away these wounds that cut me down
Oh oh oh oh

You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain

And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same
Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my
Knees
And I can't explain, I can't explain any of this

Today we'll start again the second we open up our eyes

You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain
And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same

You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain
And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same
Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my
Knees
And I can't explain, I can't explain any of this

Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my
Knees
And I can't explain, I can't explain any of this
