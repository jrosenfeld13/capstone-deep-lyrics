21 doesn't seem so older
We were young, but now I'm getting older
And time is on our side
Time is on our side
You never told me why
You had to say goodbye
Now I will surely die
All alone

It doesn't seem real
It all seems fake
I don't know how much more I can take
But I know that's life
Life is on my side
You never told me why
You had to say goodbye
Now I will surely die
All alone
