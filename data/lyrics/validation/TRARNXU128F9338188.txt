You turned a blind eye to everything I ever said
You turned a blind eye to everything I ever did
.
You didn't worry, when I called your telephone
You didn't worry, baby
You're just content to roam around

You turned a blind eye to everything I ever said
You turned a blind eye to everything I ever did

You didn't worry, when I called your telephone
You didn't worry, baby
You're just content to roam around
