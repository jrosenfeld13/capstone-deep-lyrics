I sit and think of you only, only
Like a dream, you came to me, meant to be forever
Without you I am so lonely, so lonely
So tell me where have you gone now, where have you gone?

Our love will live in the afterworld
Some things will never end, they're just too strong
It soars into the sky, beyond this world

I'll wait for you until the afterworld
We'll be together soon, it won't be long
When life goes by so fast in this world
In this world

Beyond the heavens above, beyond anything
Beyond the moment our eyes stare and see eternity
Beyond our bodies in this life, beyond the end
Is the place where our love will never die

Our love will live in the afterworld
Some things will never end, they're just too strong
It soars into the sky, beyond this world

I'll wait for you until the afterworld
We'll be together soon, it won't be long
When life goes by so fast in this world
In this world

I'll wait for you until I leave this world
I'll carry our love into the afterworld
This is not farewell, I'll meet you in the afterworld
Don't despair my love, I'll see you in the afterworld
