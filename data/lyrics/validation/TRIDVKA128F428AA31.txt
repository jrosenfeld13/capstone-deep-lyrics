Out of total hate, disgust
Ideas covered up in rust
There is not much left to trust
All our hopes turn to dust

Answer me, I've got nothing left to lose
You've got a lot to prove
Tell me why should I believe?
That you died for all my sins
You've got a lot to prove

I will erase
You, you
I will waste no time
You, you
We are not sheep nor blind
You, you
I will waste no time
You, you

And if you died for all my sins
Well then I'll destroy you with pride
Look who wins
And all it takes are dirty thoughts to kill
I'll sin a thousand times a day
I'll kill at will

I will erase
You, you
I will waste no time
You, you
We are not sheep nor blind
You, you
Now you know why
Now you will die

It is a hate I can't erase
It is a face I can't escape
It is the fear that I might fall
I pull the rip cord and give all
I can not take this lying down
When I look into this place
I want to rip you from your throne
And from this world

I will erase
You, you
Truth will replace
You, you
I will erase
You, you
Truth will replace
You, you
Truth will replace you
