I'm working hard at breaking down evenly
The sun will set soon enough eventually
So why did we breathe if not to bother
Close to selling out fully and completely
And I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
There's always a let down
This is what I know
I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
May be heavy
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
I'm losing faith in human beings daily now
They're starting wars and instead of what they're asking how
So why don't we stand
Why don't we stand for something
We're close to selling out fully and completely
I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
There's always a let down
This is what I know
I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
May be heavy
This is what I know
This is what I know
If it's cold now there's wind in store
As winter comes and opens the door
Soon may be too late, too late
It's never too late
And I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
There's always a let down
This is what I know
I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
May be heavy
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
