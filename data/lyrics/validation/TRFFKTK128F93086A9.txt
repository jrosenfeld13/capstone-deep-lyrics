Day is ending, birds are wending
Back to the shelter of
Each little nest they love
Nightshades falling, lovers calling
What makes the World go round
Nothing but love
When whippoorwills call
And evening is nigh
I hurry to my Blue Heaven
I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to my Blue Heaven
A a smiling face, a fireplace, a cosy room
A little nest that nestles where roses bloom
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in my Blue Heaven
(Orchestral Break)
A a smiling face, a fireplace, a cosy room
A little nest that nestles where roses bloom
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in my Blue Heaven
(Whistling)
A a smiling face, a fireplace, a cosy room
A little nest that nestles where roses bloom
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We hurry to my Blue Heaven
