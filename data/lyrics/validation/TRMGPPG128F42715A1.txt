Matthew is the bully and the brush
Gouging at the dirt
Working to unearth the roots of pedigree

Night arrives and cuts the skin of day
Heavy heat turns soft
Now show us what you found
Before the sweat can wash it off

The bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
How did we separate ourselves?

Hours in the stars fall back to ground
Morning is a ceasefire
Sun and moon pass lazily without an argument

Dirt under your nails turns into ash
Don't give it a name
Singing hallelujah, this is revival
This is revival

Our bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
How did we separate ourselves?

The bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
Why did we separate ourselves like this?

Do we share the same blood?
Do we wear the same cloth?
Is it all getting lost?
Are we brothers or not?

Are we brothers or not?
Are we brothers or not?
Are we brothers or not?

Our bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
How did we separate ourselves?

Our bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
Why did we separate ourselves?

Our bones in the earth
Are feathers in the urn
Why did we separate ourselves like this?
