We need united nations
We need an obligation
The entire population needs to know
I'm calling all the stations
Cause we have lost our patience
Reclaim the city and let's start today

I'm calling, screaming
It feels like I'm suffocating
I'm trapped in a world where nobody cares no more

We need a new protection
If we don't make a correction
By look in retrospection
We need a new direction
I'm pointing out the world should be a better place

I'm calling, screaming
It feels like I'm suffocating
I'm trapped in a world where nobody cares no more

I'm falling, deeper
It feels like I'm suffocating
I'm trapped in a world where nobody cares anymore
