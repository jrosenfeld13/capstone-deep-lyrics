I saw my boyfriend hanging with this girl that I hate
He didn't have to tell why last night he was late
I can't believe what you tell me
Your lies have come undone
Now I'm living on the road
Looking out for number one

I took a ride to the city
Had to get out of this place
I just can't stand the pity
When the tears fall down my face
I used to think it was over
But its only just begun
Now I'm living on the road
Looking out for number one

One day
You'll see me
But only when you're dreaming
One day
You'll say I was the one

I hitched a ride on a Greyhound stashed away on a train
Bought a ticket for the subway
Playing guitar in the rain
I wanna follow the rivers to an island in the sun
Now I'm living on the road
Looking out for number one

One day
You'll see me
But only when your dreaming
One day
You'll say I was the one

Late at night
Trying to fight
I just might think about him
Right now I'm feeling fine
I'm better off without him ya!

One day
You'll see me
But only when you're dreaming
One day
You'll say I was the one

I know that on day
You'll see me
I'll haunt you when you're dreaming
One day
You'll say I was the one
I'm number one
