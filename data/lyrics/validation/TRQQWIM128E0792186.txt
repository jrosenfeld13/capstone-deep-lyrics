[Verse 1]
Tonight I watch the lights go out in your house
Wondering how I could get so deep
And you could still get sleep
In vain, I blame my trembling on the cold air
But I can't hide that I've relied on you
Like yellow does on blue

[Chorus]
And you're my good feeling, I'm kneeling
Inside her room she paints me blue
And you are my reason for breathing
Inside her room she paints me blue again

[Verse 2]
Atlanta started raining on me
And teenage love was underground
Tonight I break the surface
Atlanta started raining on me
And no young girl was claiming me and naming me
And destiny gets nervous

[Chorus] [x2]

Atlanta started raining on me, on me
Atlanta started raining on me, on me
