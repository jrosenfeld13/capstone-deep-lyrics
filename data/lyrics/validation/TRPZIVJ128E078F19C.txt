You can hear it in the street
See it in the dragging feet
The word is getting out about control
Spies they're come and gone
The story travels on
The only quiet place is inside your soul

From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Is wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay

Pass it on

Someone disapproves
Of what you say or do
I was asked to see what I could really learn you
Don't believe your eyes
They're seeing only lies
What is done in the first place don't concern you

From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Is wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay

Relay, things are brewing
Relay, something's doin'
Relay, it's a revolution
Relay, relay
Hand me down a solution!

Pass it on
