The night is on and on
Your head roll away
I catch it when it falls
And keep it beneath my heart
So what have we become
More than a skin and bone
Oh, what could beat this love
It's so parallel
This is when we awake
This is where we don't ache
I see the sun burn it's never quite as close
As the only one and I
I can hardly wait
Again this sweet, sweet song
Oh, give me what you take
And give me all that sleazy
Give me what never ends
So what have we become
More than a skin and bones
And when do we come down
I don't care anymore
This is when we awake
This is where we don't ache
I see the sun burn it's never quite as close
As the only one and I, I can hardly wait
I see the sun burn it's never quite as close
As the only one and I can hardly wait
