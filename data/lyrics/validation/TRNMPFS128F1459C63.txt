Say goodbye
Maybe that's one way to go
Walk away and say it's over
Call it history
Do I believe that we'd be better off apart?
Can I see my world without you in it?
Baby, not for a single minute

Let the moon give up the night
All the stars leave heaven on high
The sun would burn out before I'd ever lose you
We can get over any wall
If we have to fly, run, climb, or crawl
Love will always lead us back
Where we belong

Just today
I woke up shakin' from a dream
I got a glimpse of life without you
All the good was gone
Then I realized you were lying next to me
I knew right then, baby
Come whatever
When the going gets tough
We'll face it together

Let the moon give up the night
All the stars leave heaven on high
The sun would burn out before I'd ever lose you
We can get over any wall
If we have to fly, run, climb, or crawl
Love will always lead us back
Where we belong

Baby, all we got to do is reach out
No laying blame
No guilty party
Lay our daggers down on the ground
Hold each other and say we're sorry

Let the moon give up the night
All the stars leave heaven on high
The sun would burn out before I'd ever lose you

We can get over any wall
If we have to fly, run, climb, or crawl
Love will always lead us back
Where we belong

Yeah, love's gonna lead us back
Where we belong
