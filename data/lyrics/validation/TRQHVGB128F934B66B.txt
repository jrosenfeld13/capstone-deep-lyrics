I leave the gate and close the door
And when it rains it really pours

I left her a memory
And then both men sung
Of how it ended
Before it had begun
Took a bite from the apple
Glistening red lips
The moonlight was golden
Shining off her hip

She said don't look
Just come on in
You've got to hold on never give in

We're all here
Trying to be
Someone we know that
We'll never see
We are all lost
We're down on our knees
Making believe
These are our dreams

The shadows lean on the old town square
There's nothing left to keep me here
Where promises are made of air

When did you drink
Your freedom like wine
It's not as bitter
On the other side
W're all lost
Down on our knees
Making believe
These are our dreams

How we really are
How we've always been
We're giving it all
But we're still caving in
So how do you dream
How do you think
Still giving it all
You'll give anything

You left her a memory
And then both men sung
Of how it ended
Before it had begun
Took a bite from the apple
Glistening red lips
The moonlight was golden
Shining off her hips

We're all here trying to be

We're all here
Trying to be
Someone we know
We'll never see
We're all lost
Down on our knees
Making believe
These our are dreams

Are we really how
How we've always been?
We're giving it all
But we're still caving in
How do you dream?
How do you think?
So you're giving it all
You'll give anything
