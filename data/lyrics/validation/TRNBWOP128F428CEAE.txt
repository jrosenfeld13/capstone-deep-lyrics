Accounted millions, living the dream
Some things just aren't quite what they seem...
Drowned in temptation
Black hearts turned I'll
Insatiable can't get there fill
From deep within the pits of sin
Uphold the cause to feed
While children sleep, the devil creeps
Invokes you full of greed

Unholy millions
Living a lie!
And tell it straight into they eyes
God bless the victims and cure the lame
Sometimes they all want amnesty
Now greed has ripped you heart, in a constantly as you tore it apart
So grown disease is on the soul
Harpenters (?) of your fate, laughin at you cause they know it's to late
Your future sealed the bells as told
Heavy time! ahhhhhhhhhh! noooooooooooo!

From deep within the pits of sin
Uphold the cause to feed
While children sleep, the devil creeps
Invokes you full of greed
