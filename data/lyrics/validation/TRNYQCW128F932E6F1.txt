Not an ounce of sadness or truth in what you feel
Sacrifice your sorrow for a shot at any deal
Careful not to actually bleed from your heart
Not that you can drain much from an empty fake

Is it just me or does everything reek with the stench of mediocrity
Is it just me or does everything seem to suck no matter how hard i
TRY. TO. FORGIVE
IT JUST CAN'T SEEM. TO. BELY
THE FACT THAT YOU. ARE. A
FUCKING WASTE OF LIFE!!

Recycling the talent of a god compared to you
New york city digs it so it must be something true
Truth be known it's how we've felt the rape of our spirit
You have taken all the fire from the fight you lousy whore

Sucking up your table scraps for no more than a day
Manufactured bruises and the shallowness to say
Oh, how hard it's been on you and your passion
I'll try to remember that, as i'm burning down your mansion

Is it just me or does everything reek with the stench of mediocrity
Is it just me or does everything seem to suck no matter how hard i
TRY. TO. FORGIVE
IT JUST CAN'T SEEM. TO. BELY
THE FACT THAT YOU. ARE. A
FUCKING WASTE OF LIFE!!

So this is the cross you have to bear
So this is the shit you sling at us
You're just a poseur built to fail
And fail you will
You're just a poster boy for mediocrity!

Come collecting favors and there's nothing for you left
Eating from the garbage seems the pastime you were meant
For all the soulless lies coming through the radio
We'd all agree that you should (blow yourself away)

It seems no matter how hard i...
It seems no matter how hard i...
It seems no matter how hard i...
TRY. TO. FORGIVE
IT JUST CAN'T SEEM. TO. BELY
THE FACT THAT YOU. ARE. A
FUCKING WASTE OF LIFE!!

You're just a poster boy for mediocrity!
You're just a poster boy for mediocrity!
