Unfair, unreal
I wanna tell my heart it's a quick steal
That'd be one way
To unlove you

Undressed
Unkind
That I can't erase you from my mind
That'd be another way
To unlove you

Even though my heart is tellin me to stay, beggin me to stay
My self-respect is telling me
I gotta walk away, so

I'm gonna say what I gotta say, do what I gotta do
I'm gonna break what I gotta break, cause you were untrue
I'm gonna hurt
I'm gonna cry
It's gonna tear me up inside
I'm gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you, to unlove you

Until
I heal
I wish that I could freeze every thing I feel
That'd be one way
To unlove you

Emotions
Unknown
In fact they'd only turn me into stone
And that'd be, another way
To unlove you

Even though my heart is tellin me to stay, beggin me to stay
My dignity is tellin me
I gotta walk away, so

I'm gonna say what I gotta say, do what I gotta do
I'm gonna break what I gotta break, cause you were untrue
I'm gonna hurt
I'm gonna cry
It's gonna tear me up inside
I'm gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you, to unlove you

I've gotta look you in the eye and tell the world the biggest lie
What choice do I have
When you hurt me so bad
Wrecked everything we had
So

I'm gonna say what I gotta say
I'm gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you

I'm gonna say what I gotta say, do what I gotta do
I'm gonna break what I gotta break, cause you were untrue
I'm gonna hurt
I'm gonna cry
It's gonna tear me up inside
I'm gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you, to unlove you
