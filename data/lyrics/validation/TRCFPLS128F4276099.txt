Got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe your hair's alright
Hey babe let's go (stay) out tonight
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You sexy thing, you put them on

Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so

You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You sexy thing, you put them on

Rebel rebel, put on your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know
Hot tramp, I love you so

Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so

Rebel rebel, put on your dress
Rebel rebel,your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so

Put on your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough but enough ain't the test
Transmission and live wire
You try a vibration and a handful of loot
You want a DJ when they count up the dudes

And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
