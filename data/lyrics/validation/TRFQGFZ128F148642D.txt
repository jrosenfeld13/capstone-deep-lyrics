Everything is alright, everything is fine
All you got is money and all I got is time
Everybody's happy
Everyone's relaxed
Everybody's charming
But someone's gotta attack

You better be alert
Cause you're gonna hurt
And you better beware
'cause no one will care
So you better beware
Eyes front eyes left
Eyes front eyes right
You need eyes in the back of your head
