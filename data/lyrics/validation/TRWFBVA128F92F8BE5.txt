Gone away, gone away forever
Not to come back home
I did stay all the night through with you
Without knowing you'd gone

Without time for the world to breathe on
The changing dust it woke
Glimpses of all the life you poured out
Till the vessel broke

Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so

Parting now at our own Grey Havens
The words you left the debris
So be still, knowing that He'll see you across the Sea

Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so

To be woken from the long sleep
Of this world's night

Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so
