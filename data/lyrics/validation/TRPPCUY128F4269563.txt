It's Xmas morning
The snow is falling silently from the purple sky
Little Tim is waiting for the evening
When Santa will bring those presents

But more than presents he'd wish for peace
He'd wish for safety and understanding
That there would be no more fights
That there would be no more fear
It's Xmas morning

It's Xmas evening
And I am wondering when and how did we lose the way
Christ doesn't feed the multitudes no more
God is hiding in details

Sick society maximizing the production and the profit
Alcoholic father abusing his family driving them out
It's Xmas evening

The guns blazing message of peace
The plastic holiness fills the world
We have lost the way

It's Xmas night
And I am writing in the warmth of my cozy home
I understand how lucky I am
I say my prayers and go to sleep
It's Xmas night
