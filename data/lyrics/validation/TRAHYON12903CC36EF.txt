Yeah, the roads are right tonite
They are twisting
And my mouth is dry
Like cool air inside

Maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust
Of people like new

There's people like me
And people like you

Yeah, the roads are right tonite
They are turning
And I know that deep inside the pines
An answer is lurking

And maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust
Of people like new

There's people like me
And people like you
