[Verse 1]
We grew up together
With ferris wheels and sunshine laughter
A rainbow love
That lasted after the rain
Mmm mmm mmm

[Verse 2]
And now we're separated
And I've become a lonely runner
And when I rest, I hurt and I wonder
If I'll ever see you again

[Chorus 1]
Echo Valley 2-6809
I used to call that number all the time
But the last time that I called you
We hung up cryin'
Echo Valley 2-6809
I can see it clearly in my mind
But I'm scared to call 'cause it's been
Such a long long time

[Verse 3]
Never been much for writin'
'Cause what do you say to a dream that's dyin'
A fragile lifeline that's untyin', oh no
Whoa, no

[Verse 4]
Now I can't face the sunrise
Lightin' up a road to nowhere
Where you are, I have to go there
Are you waitin'?
I got to know

[Chorus 2]
Echo Valley 2-6809
I gotta call that number one more time
'Cause I've just got to know if you're still mine

[Bridge: Spoken]
Spoken: "Hello, operator? Get me Echo Valley 2-6809"
Operator: "You have reached a disconnected number"

[Outro]
Echo Valley 2-6809
I shoulda called that number
Echo Valley 2-6809
I shoulda called that number
Echo Valley 2-6809
I shoulda called that number
Echo Valley 2-6809
I shoulda called that number
