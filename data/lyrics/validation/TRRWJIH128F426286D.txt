Somebody asked me if I wanted a ride
I said what do you mean
They said I know a woman that
They called slip-n-slide
Introduce me to a galley name of Sally
Said she rides the horses down
In Tennessee Valley

She stole my chain, she wasn't plain
That woman's crazy and a little bit vain

She likes it on top that woman never stop
She's a star, she's a hero

She said sugar for the time of your life
I get you on my horse so you will realize
She takes them boogie-woogie boys out the backdoor
Gets 'em all high on her flesh for sure
She rode my train, and then my plane
A nymphomaniac, a little insane

She likes it on top that woman never stop
She's a star, she's a hero, she likes it on top
She likes it on top that woman never stop
She's a star, she's a hero, she likes it on top
She's a hero, she likes it on top

I took a picture of her
So I would remember
She likes those dirty movies
She says they're really groovy

Comatose, I couldn't boast
I noticed later on my baby was a liar
Catatonic, supersonic
Hot, high-heeled, lover, lady sure is on fire
I can't believe the things I've seen
Lucky that I remember where the hell I've been

Somebody asked me if I wanted a ride
I said what do you mean
They said I know a woman that
They called slip-n-slide
Introduce me to a galley name of Sally
Said she rides the horses down
In Tennessee Valley

She stole my chain, she wasn't plain
That woman's crazy and a little bit vain
