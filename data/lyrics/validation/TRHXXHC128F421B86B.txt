(DAWN: Fragments of star)

It's simply too hard
To blow out all these fragments of star
The dawn never shines
I'm condemned to this eternal night

Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight it enriches my life, it
Holds me spellbound

It crawls all inside
It's the wish to back down and hide
Like the calm sea
It's the haven of forces within

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

(DAY: Autumn runes)

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone, symbols of my childhood
Gone, on the wind floats a dream
And hundreds of my broken promises
And oaths
Taken by the stream, artefacts of what I
Was

Read the signs on the trees
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

Another night has passed, and with it all
The fears and dreads are gone
And the shadows have faded

Clouds are leaving the sky, the horizon
Point out new ways to be found
There is always a trail to follow, and it will
Take you home

Follow all the scents
Before light passes away
Long before the shadows fall
As covering miles in the distance
You will see
What you searched
You will catch sight of your dreams
Dwelling forevermore, wander aimlessly

It's the fatal falling, on the path we
Choose
We're searching for answers
That never appear
We're searching for lands beyond
All limits, we're falling!

Millions of emotions (have) passed
Through my heart since I'm on this Earth
But the ones that remain are the ones
We're living for

(Repeat Bridge & Chorus)
(Solos: Aydan, Jarpen, both)

(TWILIGHT: The chant of the first snow)

It's the sweetest Night of all
It's a moment that lengthens
To eternity and more
While the flakes soundless will fall
I hear the sound of laugther
Coming from so high above
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

It's the Night of cruel remorse
It remains only a distant memory
Of things undone
A return to innocence
A travel back in time when everything
Seems clear and pure
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

(DEEP NIGHT: The Dreamcurse)

Cursed, cursed
That lone and threadlike figure
So shapelessly unbounded
Will haunt that empty jar
That is me

Cursed, cursed
I'm deep into transparency
A dreamy spiral staircase
A voice, a whisper echo in the gloom

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
I sharpen all my sleeping senses
Encircle my own wish
I'll never die!

Cursed, cursed
A gloomy sense of sadness
Impaled my arid heart
To the sceptre of melancholy

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
On the stroke of my halfhour
The token has been shown
Eternal wearing the Red Death masque!

Thousand ways of living
In the end (I) got my reward
I don't feel alone no more

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes
While you're holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

...and finally is day again...

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone
Symbols of my childhood gone
On the wind floats a dream and hundreds
Of my broken promises and oaths
Taken by the stream
Artefacts of what I was

Read the signs on the trees
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

It's the fatal falling
On the path we choose
We're searching for answers
That never appear
We're searching for lands beyond
All limits, we're falling!
