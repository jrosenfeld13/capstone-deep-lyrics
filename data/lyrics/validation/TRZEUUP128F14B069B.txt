Now look out!

[Verse 1]
I took a record of pretty music
I went down and baby you can tell
I took a record of pretty music
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell

[Chorus]
I'll stick it deep inside
I'll stick it deep inside
Cause I'm loose

[Verse 2]
I feel fine to be dancin',baby
I feel fine, I'm a shakin' leaf
I feel fine to be dancin', baby
Cause it's love, yeah I do believe

[Verse 1]
I took a record of pretty music
I went down and baby you can tell
I took a record of pretty music
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell

[Chorus]
And I'll stick it deep inside
And I'll stick it  hey!
Well I'm loose
Well I'm loose
Well I'm loose
