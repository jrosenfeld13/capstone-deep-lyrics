Who's wrong who's right
Life's to short to waste on fighting
There has to be a better way to
Settle out our different opinions
We all want the freedom
To choose in what to believe
We have to learn to accept
One another

It's not the way to go
To kill someone that you don't know
Just because he's not like you at all
It's not O. K
No it's not the way to go
To kill someone that you don't know
Isn't it waste to die for a conviction
Isn't it waste to die when we can live

Life's to short to waste on fighting
There has to be a better way to
Settle out our different opinions
We all want the freedom
To choose in what to believe
We have to learn to accept
One another

Yeah, we could agree to disagree
We could accept our differences

It's not the way to go...
