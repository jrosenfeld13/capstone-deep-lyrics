(Shawn Colvin)
I don't know why
The sky is so blue
And I don't know why
I'm so in love with you
But if there were no music
Then I would not get through
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do
I don't know where
But somewhere dreams come true
And I don't know where
But there will be a place for you
And everytime you look that way
I would lay down my life for you
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do
I don't know why
But some are going to make you cry
And I don't know why
But I will get you by, I will try
They're not trying to cause you pain
They're just afraid of loving you
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do
I don't know why
The trees grow so tall
And I don't know why
I don't know anything at all
But if there were no music
Then I would not get trough
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do
