All I have about the way things go
I don't know, I just don't know
Make up some simple lies
And compromise how I live

'Cause either way, I'll break your heart someday
But leaving you is the last thing on my mind
So when I go, baby kiss real slow
So I don't forget to make my way back home
When I go

Sail away on a wayward ship
With candy lips in my grip
Cheap perfume, it never lies
And I can't supply any good alibis

Well I miss you in the winter
Your friends say I should listen
But can't you see I've loved you all along?
Well if america don't like me
You can say I finally became a man
Who only likes a gun
Shoot anyone, shoot anyone...
