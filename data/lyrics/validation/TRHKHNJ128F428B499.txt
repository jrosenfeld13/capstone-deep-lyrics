[Verse 1]
Sing this song with me
And you will never be sad or alone
On the road or at home
Sing along with me
And your eyes will see what your ears hear
And that's our voices, my dear

[Verse 2]
Sing this song with me
And you will never be sad or alone
On the road or at home
Sing along with me (sing along with me)
And your eyes will see (and your eyes will see) what your ears hear
And that's our voices, my dear

[Outro]
Sing this song with me (sing this song with me)
Sing this song with me (sing this song with me)
Sing this song with me (sing this song with me)
Sing this song with me

Sing this song with me
Sing this song with me
Sing this song with me
Sing this song with me

Sing this song with me
