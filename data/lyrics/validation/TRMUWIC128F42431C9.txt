Open up your eyes
And see what we are doing to each other
We filled the world with hate
We take advantage of our brothers

So listen to me now
So many paths for us to follow
Just want to shed some light
On all that we are forced to swallow

I can't believe it
I have foreseen it
Casting heavy shadows
On all that we know
Running out of chances
A victim's circumstances
The theory that is forming
Leads to global warning
