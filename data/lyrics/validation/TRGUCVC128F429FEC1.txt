[Verse 1]
I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
I'm looking out
Is this my life I'm wonderin'
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around?
Is this the bed I chose to make?
There's greener pastures
I'm thinkin' about
Wide open spaces far away

[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared

[Chorus]
Wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses

[Verse 2]
I see the girl I wanna be
Riding bareback
Carefree along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping headfirst
Headlong without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free

[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared

[Chorus]
Wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
I wanna run too

[Bridge]
Recklessly abandoning myself before you
I wanna open up my heart
Tell him how I feel

[Chorus]
Wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
I wanna run with the wild horses
