Sworn to secrecy
I might go after school
She was an angel
I saw her swimming there
I am in such a mess
I can't cope without this
She just teases me
Pretends she can't see me here

So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone

Don't want to wake up
Don't want to wake up

The blind lead the blind
So why can't I find my way
This could be heaven
But I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out
From behind here
My body is aching
It feels like it's wearing me

So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone

Don't want to wake up
Don't want to wake up
