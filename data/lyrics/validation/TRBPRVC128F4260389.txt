High tales, and low tales, love has no part in
Story upon story, would you marry me?

23 lies you told, many more lives you hold
Thought I could believe, thought I could believe

How long can you play this? How long can you last?
Gaze up, you're so restless, on your way down fast

23 lies you told, many more lives you hold
23 lies you told, many more lives you hold
Thought I could believe
