[Verse 1]
All of the boys and the girls here, in Paris
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness
I can't keep up, I'm a wreck, but I want it
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?
All of the boys and the girls here, in Paris
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness
I can't keep up, I'm a wreck, but I want it
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?

[Chorus]
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long

[Verse 2]
Kids in the street drinking wine, on the sidewalk
Saving the plans that we made, 'till it's night time
Give me your glass, it's your last, you're too wasted
Or get me one too, cause I'm due any tasting
Kids in the street drinking wine, on the sidewalk
Saving the plans that we made, 'till it's night time
Give me your glass, it's your last, you're too wasted
Or get me one too, cause I'm due any tasting

[Chorus]
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long

[Bridge]
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you

[Chorus]
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long
My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long

[Outro]
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you
I've lost my way, it's hard to find it through
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you
