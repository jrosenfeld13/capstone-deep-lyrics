[Verse 1]
One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go
And if you will stay here with me
Then we will always know

[Hook]
We will find out
As we change about
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout

[Verse 2]
One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go
These days await if we believe
I'll make it to the show

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far away
And you could say "Your love to me"
That I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far away

[Verse 3]
I've lost myself once and I see
That I was weak at heart
And if you will stay here with me
We face the hardest part

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 4]
If you believe a hand on your sleeve
Can pull you over
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder

If you believe a hand on your faith
Can pull you over
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder

[Outro]
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far away
