I had dreams and crazy schemes
Never felt this way before
I had days when I god raged
Never felt like this before
Endless nights that end in flights
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never more than now
Paralysed by vicious lies
Never felt this way before
Seen hope die and grown men cry
Never felt like this before
Shed lonely tears and heartfelt fears
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
A thing of beauty
Lasts forever
Stretches through all time
Every endeavour
No matter how hard
They might try
To build you up
And to bleed you dry
Never lose love. Never
Never lose love. Never
Ever, ever, ever
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
