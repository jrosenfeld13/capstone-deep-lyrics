[Verse]
Extraordinary
The love you make to me it's some kind of scary
I would be a fool to leave you for I was born to love you
This is true
Extraordinary
The way you make me feel
I'm so very glad it's real
And not a dream
Even though it seems I am dreaming
People try to break us up
There were times a little rough
But we survived because we had a love
Extraordinary
I'd give the world to you
Each and every thing you do is so very nice
You make my clock tick twelve twice
Then disappear time and everything else
When you are near
Extraordinary
