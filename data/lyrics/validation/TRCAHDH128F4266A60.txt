[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
There'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we've got a way to communicate
It keeps a happy home

[Hook 1]
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

[Hook 2]
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me

[Verse 2]
When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but, 'cause it always works

[Hook 1]
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

[Hook 3]
Whatever you want (whatever you want babe)
It's alright with me (it's alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me (baby)

[Hook 2]
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
