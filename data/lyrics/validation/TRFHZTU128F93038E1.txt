Well there's a little boy waiting at the counter of a corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says

[Chorus]
What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Well there's a pretty girl serving at the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for her dreams
Her dreams walk in and out they never stop
Well she's not too proud to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

[Chorus]
What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

[Chorus]
So take a step back and see the little people
They may be young but they're the ones
That make the big people big
So listen, as they whisper
What about me

And now I'm standing on the corner all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more than I've got

[Chorus]
What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more

What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more
You just take more
You just take more
You just take more than you give

What about me
What about me
What about me
