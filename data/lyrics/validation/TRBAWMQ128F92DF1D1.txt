[Pirate Chant:]
Yo ho ho
Yo ho ho
Give us a bottle of rum
Yo ho ho
Yo ho ho
We be the scurvy scum

[Fade in Pirate Chant 2x]

Upon the seven seas we are the dread
We shackle our foes and keelhauls 'em dead
Walk the plank, fall in the sea
Food for the sharks, your destiny
Band of brothers and all for one
Taking treasure by sword or gun
With an iron fist we are led
By the Captain's word or we be dead

[Chorus:]
Scurvy Scum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum

When the crow's nest man yells 'Ships Ahoy'
We load the cannon with balls to deploy
Slit their throat or run them through
Take what we want and kill their crew
Aboard their ship we take control
Throw their captain in the hold
Bury the treasure and getaway
Just another pirate's day

[Chorus]

Daggers and rum
(You'll walk the plank)
Daggers and rum
(To the sharks)
Daggers and rum
(evil pirate laugh)
Daggers and rum

Watch the horizon for ships to loot
Steal the gold, the pirate's fruit
Raise a drink and all be hearty
Rape, pillage an plunder, just a party
Outlaw varmints with nothing to lose
Making our lives the way we choose
Live by the sword or die in a fight
Jolly Roger you do what's right

Scurvy Scum
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
Daggers and rum
