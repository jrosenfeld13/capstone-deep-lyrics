If you need me, call me
If you need me, call me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong if things go wrong
I-I-I'll be home, whoa-oh-oh, home

If you want me, send for me
If you want me, send for me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just pick up your phone
And I'll hurry home where I belong

[Spoken:]
People have always said, darlin', that I didn't mean you no good
And you would leave me someday
But way deep down in my heart I know that I've done the best I could
That's why I know that one of these days, it won't be long, you'll come walkin' through that same door
And I can imagine in my mind that these are the words that you'll be sayin':

I still love you, always thinkin' of you
I still love you, always thinkin' of you
No matter what the people say
I won't stay away
And if you need me I'll hurry home where I, I belong
