[Verse 1]
The eagle wants a canyon
And a place where he can rest his wings a while
The drifter wants a freight train
That will carry him another hundred miles
The lion's only looking for something he can sink his teeth into
Oh and I want you

[Verse 2]
The devil wants a fella
With a weakness he can wrap his arms around
The champion wants a challenger
Who just might have the strength to take him down
The river wants an ocean to run towards
And pour its heart into
Oh and I want you

[Verse 3]
Oh, every time that I'm around you
Oh, I'm on fire when we touch
Oh, when I hold you boy you know
I can't get close enough
Yes i want you

[Verse 4]
I could cry and say I need you
Tell you that I die when you're not here
I could lie and say I love you
Pour a little poison in your ear
But all i'm going to give you is
Nothing but the bare and naked truth
Baby I want you
Baby I want you
