When I'm with my friends then it's magic in the air-air
Good vibrations always surround us
Play some good music, the moment has left
Happiness and joy's everywhere-ere-ere

So have a good a time, everyone have some fu-u-un
People leave your problems behind you
Come and sing along, join in on my song
Sing about this magical ni-i-ight

Magic night - magic's in the music
It's a magic night - we all need the music
We can have a good time
And enjoy all the magical vibes of this great -
Magic night - good friends all around you
It's a magic night - magic sure will find you
So let's all try tonight to feel love
Coming from inside each other

When I'm with my friends, friends with whom I can share-are-are
All my ups and downs and betweens with
When I'm with my boys, the moments are clear
So much love is found in the air-air-air

Magic's when I come, together with my frie-ie-iends
People from the world all around us
Sharing good things we all love to share
So much love is found in the air-air-air

Magic night - magic's in the music
It's a magic night - we all need the music
We can have a good time and enjoy all the magical vibes
Of this great magic night - good friends all around you
