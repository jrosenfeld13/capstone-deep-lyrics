[Chorus 1]
Yeah I hope you have a lonely life
Yeah I hope you have a lonely life

[Verse 1]
Her high heels stumble home from the gala
With your goodie bag
Clutched to your chest
Hanging on the arm of the guy
Who sewed you
Into your new dress

Ooh, it's a tragedy
So completely
It's almost Greek
And if I was to be hard-pressed
I'd lie and say I
Could not care less

[Chorus 2]
Yeah I hope you have a lonely life
Yeah I hope you have a lonely life
A lonely life

[Verse 2]
One red carpet bleeds into another
You're stained and
It won't rub off
Lining up to get under your covers
The boys with white belts
Snouts for the trough

Ooh, it's a tragedy
So completely
I'll bury me
And if I was to be hard-pressed
I'd lie and say I
Am not obsessed

[Chorus 3]
Yeah I hope you have a lonely life
A lonely life

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Yeah (x4)
