Use this time to step aside
And look around with your feeble eyes
Use this time to forget me
Use these days to lie awake
And feel the loss of my embrace
But don't use anymore of me
And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to
And when to move along?
Use your hands to feel the man
I gave my plan and off you ran to find
Someone new who was not me
Use your favorite photograph
To play the recent memory back
Are you still as cold as I am?
And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to
And when to move along?
Well, it started off a simple black and blue
Hidden behind the untrue
But now it's surfacing, I need to be released
From the love that was you
From the love that was you
And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to?
'Cause I want to say
And I want to say I forgive you
And I want to know
And I want to know when to choose to
And when to move along
And when to move along
