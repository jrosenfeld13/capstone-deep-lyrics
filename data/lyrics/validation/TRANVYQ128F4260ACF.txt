You've got tower over me that I just can't understand
The good in you is gone and the devil has command
I'd leave but I can't stay so what good would it do
When your mem'ry comes and gets me and leads me back to you
I just don't understand why I love you like I do
My heart keeps searching for just a spark of good in you
You've got such a hold on me everytime I think I'm free
Your mem'ry comes and gets me and leads me back to you
Everytime I find the strenght to pull myself away
Everytime I got the nerve to say we're through
You led me play awhile then like a wayward child
Your mem'ry comes and gets me and leads me back to you

Yes you led me play awhile...
