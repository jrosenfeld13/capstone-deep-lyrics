Relgion serves a purpose - this I realize
But when they organize it - when they commit the crimes
The crimes upon the weak and the crimes upon the poor
Spreading filthy money baskets under stained glass windows
And pockets full of water are placed at the door
And they call it holy - you get your money's worth
What it's worth? Oh I'll tell you what it's worth

'cause they go away, we go home to repent - yeah

So let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live
Let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live

Time is wasted in seeking out a redemption's bliss
'cause I won't be afraid, and I can't be ashamed
Of my life - or my past mistakes

'cause they go away, we go home to repent

So let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live
Let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live

Pockets full of water placed at the door
They call it holy - you get your money's worth
What it's worth? Oh I'll tell you what it's worth

Let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live
Let's stop feeding the rich
They've got enough to live

Stop feed - stop feed - stop feed - stop feed -
Stop feeding the rich
