These times are tough
I know, but it's okay
'cause there are no directions
We'll make them up on the way
I was thinking back
To a time, I was afraid
It's not so long ago
In fact I think it's today

So why don't we start
Here with this broken heart?
'cause I can't fix it on my own

We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight

Maybe we're growing up
Or apart, but it's okay
'cause while I'd love to stay now
I think it's time to run away
What else can I do?
I say and with that in mind
To make this last forever
I think we're running out of time

So why don't we start
Here with this broken heart?
'cause I can't fix it on my own

We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight
We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight

We've got to make this right
We've got to make this right
We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight

We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight
We've got to make this right
We've got to fix it tonight

Tell me (We've got to make this right)
You think
We'll get through everything (We've got to fix it tonight)
Tell me (We've got to make this right)
You think
We'll get through everything (We've got to fix it tonight)
