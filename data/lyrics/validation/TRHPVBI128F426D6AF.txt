[Verse 1]
Kicking down the road
Feeling mighty slowed
With the likes of you
Getting mighty spaced
Never had a taste
Of what you're going' through
I can't bitch
Went from rags to riches
Then to ragtime screaming the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to know why
Everybody's good intentions
Try to make a fool out to of me

[Chorus]
I want to know why
Everybody's good intentions
Got to make a fool
Got to make a fool
Try to make a fool out to of me

[Verse 2]
Swing low
Sweet cherry o
When a strange love showed me the way
You see more
Can't keep a score
When the whore's coming on for the play

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
E. Poe
Eating crow
Wonder if he know that the raven was mad
