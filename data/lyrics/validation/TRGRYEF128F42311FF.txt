You don't know about me
And you don't care what affair still haunts me
And you don't know what it is about me
And I don't care, I don't care if you love me
Tonight we'll be whoever we like
Tonight we'll leave our troubles behind
Tonight in each other we'll hide
Tonight will be alright...
And I don't know about you
And I don't care about the girl behind you
And I don't know what it is about you
It makes me want to run and jump inside you
Tonight in each other we'll hide
Tonight we'll leave our troubles behind
Tonight we'll be whoever we like
Tonight, tonight will be alright...
You don't understand why my heart feels bad
From the love you hold out in your hand
And you offer it without command
I just don't know why I can't get you inside
Why I need you tonight...
Cause you don't know about me
And you don't care how this affair will break me
And why should I care about you, if you don't care
You don't care that i love you?
