I hear your voice in the deepest silence
In my dream, where my time stands still
I hear your voice in my waterfall of tears!

One breath in the thousands rays of sun
One look like touch of invisible God
But my words are too naked to believe - in this cry

You close my lips by crying sky
Flowing with a streams of colourful lights
Please speak to me only with your eyes

I can see nothing, except you, except you

You've covered my world by your love

Crucify on your arms
I remember this time
Our innocent lust
Behind burning eyes
Now I hear these words
Nothing compares to your smile

You close my lips by crying sky
Flowing with a streams of colourful lights
Please speak to me only with your eyes

I can see nothing, except you, except you

You've covered my world by your love
