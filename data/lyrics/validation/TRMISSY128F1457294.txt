Woke up a little too rough
Looking like a quarter when a dollar ain't enough
This room is just a mess
Nothing's ever working and I couldn't care less
You know I ain't got no honey
Because I ain't got no money
Broke up, no goodbye
Now it's down to slumming and living high and dry

So don't go coming around
No more bringing me down

There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, now you've got a ticket, it's all over now

So tough all her jive
"Need a lot of action just to keep it alive"
Blue moon, love in June
Nothing but a promise of trouble coming soon
Ain't got a lover
Who ain't got another
Woke up just enough
Give you all I ought to but it never was enough

So don't go coming around
No more bringing me down

There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, it's all over now
There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, now you've got a ticket, it's all over now

She done me wrong
It's all over town
Now she's gone
Your turn to cry

There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, it's all over now
There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, now you've got a ticket, it's all over now
Over now
It's all over now
