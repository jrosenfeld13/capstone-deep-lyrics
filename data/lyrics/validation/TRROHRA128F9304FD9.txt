There's a strange pain in my heart
Beats in time like the sun
You're afar
It's a lie
You can't deny, sometimes you shine

So, do I love you?
I love you
And I'm with you
Forever

I don't wanna to change
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more
More than day

There is a hard look in your eye
There is a hard look in your eye

There's a strange pain in my heart
Beats in time like the sun
You're afar
It's a lie
You can't deny, sometimes you shine

So, do I love you?
I love you
And I'm with you
Forever

I don't wanna change
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more
More than day

There is a hard look in your eye
There is a hard look in your eye

So, do I love you?
I love you
And I'm with you
Forever

I don't wanna change
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more
More than day
