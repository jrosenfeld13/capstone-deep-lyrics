I Believe in miracles, Baby
I Believe in you
I Believe in miracles, Baby
I Believe in you

They say the day is ending
Let's watch the sun go down
And plan a holiday for two
For all eternity
We will ride a cloud so you can see
The world i created just for you

I saw you standing on the street
I wanted to meet, just stop a while
You give me a smile to say hello
You make me feel so good inside
That i realised that I couldn't hide
The feeling that came when you failed to say

I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
Don't you
Don't you

I Believe in You
I Believe in Miracles Baby
I Believe in You

I don't know what people are saying
Or what games that they are playing
Or if they are playing that same old game on me
People never knowing where they are going or what they are showing
So come on boys, show a little love for me

I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
Don't you
Don't you

I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
I Believe in Miracles
Dont you
Dont you

La La La...

Here we are together face to face
Forever in a place that i created
Just for you,you,you
So people are better than what you give
Believe in dreams and think they are real
And one day soon
The miracle will come true

I Believe in Miracles
Dont you
I Believe in Miracles
Dont you
I Believe in Miracles
Dont you
Dont you
I Believe in Miracles..
