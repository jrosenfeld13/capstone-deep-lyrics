My bones are shaking, body's quaking
What's the hell with me
Well I'm possessed with strange disease
And it won't set me free
I've got to rock and it's the only
Way to feel all right
The moment I will stop to move
My butt I'll simply die
So I am ready, ready for radioactive rock
Well I am ready, ready for radioactive rock
Yes I am ready, ready for radioactive rock
This song is so effective
Completely radioactive... rock!
At first I was so scared and then
I felt myself a clown
But then I found I'm not the only
Sick man in my town
I found more young cats under action
Of Chernobyl's rays
We formed a crazy rocking rolling
Radioactive race
So we are ready, ready for radioactive rock...
We've got to rock we just can't stop
Since 1986
Disease is spreading 'round the Earth
The whole world soon will be sick
And now I'm knocking at your door
C'mon don't be so slow
Don't be too late I hate to wait
It's really time to go
So are you ready, ready for radioactive rock...
