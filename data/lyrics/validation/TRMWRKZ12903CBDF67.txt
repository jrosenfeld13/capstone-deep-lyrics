[Verse 1]
You're off by a long shot
You've got to find your reason right now
To put that eye up to the keyhole
To find the answers to the questions
What's it like or what's in fashion
This passion keeps us moving along
Could I be down to try to get up off the ground
To survive without you
Cause you'll still be living
While I'm busy singing to live
Give up, give in
Or get up on the roof of the big time
And try to pretend you knew better
I don't care about you
Cause you'll still be living
While I'm busy singing

[Chorus]
Take one step
Have you got it in you
You'll have to take it if you want to
You'll have to face the consequences
That can bring you down
Don't try and play the game
Cause you could get knocked back underground
Take one step
Have you got it in you
You'll have to fake it like you always do
You'll have to face the consequences
That can bring you down
Don't try and play the game
Cause you could get knocked back underground

[Verse 2]
You're off by a long shot
You've got to find your reason right now
To keep your hands inside the game
To find your ride for the long haul
And let you shoulder all the blame
For this monster you can't tame
I try to pretend I knew better
I'm not scared
But I should be
Cause you'll still be living
While I'm busy singing
I will not let you live

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So take your chances
Treading water in the fountain of youth
The truth will set you free
Well now you're drowning in the water
In the fountain of youth
The world will set you free
Well now you're floating in the water
In the fountain of youth
The truth will set you free
Well now you're poisoning the water
In the fountain of youth
The world will set you free

[Chorus]
