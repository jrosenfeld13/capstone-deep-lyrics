Well a country boy named Shorty and a city boy named Dan
Had to prove who could run the fastest to win Miss Lucy's hand
Now Dan had all the money and he also had the looks
But Shorty must've had somethin' boys that can't be found in books
Well cut across Shorty Shorty cut across that's what Miss Lucy said
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across it's you I want to wed

Now Dan with his long legs flyin' left Shorty far behind
But Shorty could hear him holler Miss Lucy you'll still be mine
But Shorty wasn't bit worried with a smile upon his face
He knew that he was gonna win cause Miss Lucy had fixed the race
Well cut across Shorty...

Now Dan had been a training mhm weeks before the race
And he was sure that little Shorty would end up in second place
But just like that old story about the turtle and the hare
When Dan acrossed the finish line he found Shorty waitin' there
Well cut across Shorty...
