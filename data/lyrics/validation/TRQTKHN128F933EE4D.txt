[Intro]
Shoutout my nigga
Lil CJ
This one's for you
Yeah

[Verse]
Coolest motherfucker on the microphone
Work touch down, hit the pylon
Money longer than a mile, this morning man
I musta been countin' a couple hours long
Then I get
Back to the money, back to the sack, back to the rap
Back to the pack, nigga, where I don't slack
Got a ratchet that I normally have
It got a light and the flash
I shoot the shit, you take a laxative bath
I got a package, let me [?]
She don't even know a nigga hit her [?]
She don't even let me fuck, so I feel on her ass
And pay a bill on her ass, I treat her spot like a [?]
I got a Benz, but I want a lil Jag, I got a bag
I want another lil bag, I want my niggas home, other than that
Life's great, Tony the Tiger with tats, Frosted Flakes and a tape in the bag
I toilet paper the tag, my self esteem was like an eight and a half
Now it's a ten, ten karats, twenty thousand in cash
1G the mob, take the gang without a robbery [?]
I kill the game and make it look like a crash, like an accident happened
But a nigga sent a hit in his raps, so act surprised when that actually happen
I'm a humble assassin, even though a nigga rap, I'm active
Keep a K, Kanye, Kardashian, man, ignite my passion
Dust to dust, ash to ashes, Imma kill it every time I cash in
Call the plug, let him know I need another one up
You gotta keep my brick out in the castle
Like to cut it out a tape every time I make a play nigga
Gettin' money nigga, all day, nigga, every day nigga
I was en route nigga, they was gon' wait nigga
I was on money nigga, they was on yay nigga
All I do is grind, I just bought another safe nigga
I can't even play wit em, not a 2K nigga
This is not a game nigga, I'm just a caked nigga
Get ya cake baked nigga, I'm the fuckin' baker nigga
Baking soda baby, I just drop it in the bubbles
How I wrestle with the rock, they think this shit a Royal Rumble
I fuck a nigga bitch and make 'em hate his baby mama
Cuz I'm gettin' all this money and [?]
If a nigga wanna hate, he could hate on me
[?] in my chain, [?] in my pinky ring
[?]
Every day I wake up, I be livin' in the dream (dream, dream, dream), dream
I don't even blink when I speak, damn
Nigga look you dead in yo eyes, tell no fairytales, no lies
Everything one G, one thous' (one thousand)
While I be slidin', I bring that beat back
I spit my pain on these tracks, my powerhouse has to smoke her, but she fuck 'round and relapse
She pull my phone, I pull up, I show her nothin' but love
The money is my lil drug, I just be givin' hoes drugs, bitch, 1G

[Outro]
Pompano Weezy (this 1G)
Pompany Weezy (this 1G)
This that Pompano Weezy (bitch, 1G)
This that Pompano Weezy
(And I am Dirty 1000)
And I don't need no pen and pad while I'm in there, oh, yeah
(PW2)
Yeah, Yeah
It's that Pompano 2, this that Weezy 2
