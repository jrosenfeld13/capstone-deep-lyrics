[Intro]
(Let it go) x45

[Refrain]
Stop and just breathe a little
Let it go, go, breathe a little
Just let it, let it, let it breath a little
Stop!
And just and breathe a little
Let it, let it, let it breathe

[Verse]
My train just passed
So as I wait for another
This is the rhyme that I uttered
See it's more than having the world in my hands
It's like the galaxy is spread across the keys of this baby grand
So as we expand together for better or worse
I create music for the U-N-I-verse
Seems like a blessing but it's also a curse
When I'm deep in depression and the time that it works
My best material is written when everything's pivotal
Each thought is critical
It's like the tears from my eyes
Rains on the pain
And becomes the lubrication for the thoughts in my brain

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
(Stop and just breathe a little)
(Now let's get)
(Down)

[Refrain]
Let it go, go, breathe a little
Just let it, let it, let it breathe a little
Stop!
And just let it breathe a little, let it, let it
Let it breathe a little
Just let it breathe a little, let it, let it flow
Let it breathe a little
Just, uh, let it breathe a little, let it, let it, let it breathe

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
(Stop and just breathe a little)

[Bridge]
Just make sure everything's alright
You nearly missed your flight
But I hope we meet toni-i-ight
Now I'm chilling in this club without deception
Try to text directions to my heart
So she could come and we could dance
And break it down, down, baby girl lets get
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's get down, oh, down, baby girl let's get
Down, down, down, down
(Stop and just breathe a little)
Down, down, baby girl let's get
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's get down, oh, down baby girl let's get
Down, down, down, down

[Outro]
(Stop and just breathe a little)
(Now let's get)
(Down)
