You got a secret under the table
Nobody knows it but you
Never a problem here on the outside
You're good at disguising the truth

After you wake up out of the nightmare
How do you cast out the fear inside

[Chorus]
All alone there you stand
Reaching out for someone's hand
Come with me if you wanna save yourself

Where is the good life you always dreamed of
Where is the faith you once had
Sooner or later hope will be useless
Pushing you back where you began

All alone there you stand
Won't you let me take your hand
Come with me if you wanna save yourself
Don't let the past haunt your mind
You should leave it all behind
Come with me if you wanna save yourself

There's something in the way
It's gotten into you
You've learned to love the chains
Through the needle's eye can you escape

All alone there you stand
Won't you let me take your hand
Come with me if you wanna save yourself
Trust your heart not your mind
Cause you're running out of time
Come with me if you wanna save yourself
