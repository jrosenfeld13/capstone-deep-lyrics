Oh-Oh Believe me I have tried
To work this out from the inside
Then I finally realized
I just needed to move on with my life

Try to make something happen
Not just sit around and wait for it
This place is like a prison
I think I'm gonna make a break for it

Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
Its like I'm living for the fist time
Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
And I'm thinking its the first time I felt alive

(Alive)

I've been supressed, I've been let down
Been pushed aside, been pushed around
There's only one thing that I need
That's something you can't take from me

Try to make something happen
Not just sit around and wait for it
This place is like a prison
I think I'm gonna make a break for it

Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
Its like I'm living for the fist time
Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
And I'm thinking its the first time I felt alive

Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
Its like I'm living for the fist time
Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
And I'm thinking its the first time I felt alive

Move out, move on
You blink, and I'm gone
I've only got one life to live
I'll live it now

You have your doubts
I'll prove them wrong
This is the only thing I know
So here I go

Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
Its like I'm living for the fist time
Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
And I'm thinking its the first time I felt alive

Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
Its like I'm living for the fist time
Whoa-oh-oh Here I go
And I'm thinking its the first time I felt alive
