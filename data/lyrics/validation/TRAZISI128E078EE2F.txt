[Verse 1: Steven Tyler]
Get yourself a cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead

[Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

[Verse 2]
Shady looking loser, you played with my gun
No smooth-face lawyer to get you undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Fate comes a-knocking, doors start locking
Your old time connection, change your direction
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend

[Verse 4]
When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

[Outro Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance
