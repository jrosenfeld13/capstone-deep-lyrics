When I was down, babe, you reached out your hands to guide
When I was feeling so sorry, I've been hurt so deep inside
I realize no amount of love, yeah, can take away those lies, no, baby
Yeah, tried to catch your dog, baby, but the dog was mean
Came to your door, it was closed, yeah, you put a wound in my shoulder
For something to lean on, baby, how much it hurts, you know the load
Oh, deep inside, you wouldn't be too wrong, somewhere along the road
Yeah, all things, baby, catch up with you
Watch yourself
Well, I'll be around
No amount of love, can take away those lies
I'm taking them away now
I realize no amount of love, yeah
Can take away those lies, no baby
I'm taking them away
Oh, everything you gave me, baby, you want to take it back
There's one story, darling, that's out of sight
Don't want nothing from you, woman, I didn't need no schooling
Until a lot less amount of loving you, baby, for me to see the fool
I realize no amount of loving, can take away those lies
Can't take 'em away now, I realize, baby, not any amount of loving
Can take away those lies, can't take 'em away now, take 'em away
Oh, take 'em away now, take 'em away, babe
No amount of love, yeah
Um, baby
