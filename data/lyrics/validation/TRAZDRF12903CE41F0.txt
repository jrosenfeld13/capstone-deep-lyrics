How many times have I shut my eyes and hit myself in the head?
Over something that I could have done, should have done and what should have been said?
Well, oh well. I guess I'll have to think of something else to do
What the hell. I think I'll sit around and sulk over you

Complain and cry! I don't know why
What a fucking waste. GO!

How many times have I shut my mouth and wished a hole through the wall?
Now and then. I shake my head. Now it's dead because I made the wrong call
Well, oh well. I guess I'll have to think of something else to do
What the hell. I think I'll sit around and sulk over you

Complain and cry! I don't know why
What a fucking waste. GO!

What's a day without regrets? To me it's nothing new
How many times have I regressed just when I thought of you?
