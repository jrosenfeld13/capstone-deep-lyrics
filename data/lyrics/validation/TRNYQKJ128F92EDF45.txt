[Verse 1]
There are certain people you just keep coming back to
She is right in front of you
You begin to wonder could you find a better one
Compared to her now, she's in question

[Pre-Chorus]
And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

[Chorus]
Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there

[Verse 2]
Looking for the right one, you line up the world to find
Where no questions cross your mind
But she won't keep on waiting for you without a doubt
Much longer for you to sort it out

[Pre-Chorus]
And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

[Chorus]
Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
Maybe you want it, maybe you need it
Maybe it's all you're running from
Perfection will not come

[Bridge]
And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes
We'd never know what's wrong without the pain
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

[Chorus]
Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
Maybe you want it, maybe you need it
Maybe it's all you're running from
Perfection will not come

[Outro]
Maybe you want her, maybe you need her
Maybe you had her, maybe you lost her to another
To another
