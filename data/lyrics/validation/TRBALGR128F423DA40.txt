Rise above, rise above
Steal away to hide your shame
Rise above, rise above!

Rise above your oppression
Above the one that hates you
Above the one that lies
Above the pain that hates
Death! Fear! Rage!

Rise above your depression
Above the one that kills
Above the one that hates
Above all of the pain
Fear! Death! Rage!

Rise above, rise above
Rise above
Rise
Rise
Rise

Rise above your oppression
Above the pain and suffering
Above the one that hates you
And kills you
Through all of your life
