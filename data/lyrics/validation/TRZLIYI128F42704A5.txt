Born only a month ago
Yet I'm fully grown from head to toe
Lots of metal, lots of grease
Then put together piece by piece

To support a system that uses me
But the day is here, they're goiong to see

I'm on a mission
'Cause now I've had it
I've watched your system
And I spit right at it
I was born and plated
A schmuck they created

I'll explode
I'll erode
Yeah I'll break your fucking code
'Cause I'm an automatic schmuck
With a tendency to rock

Deprived of mind but yet I know
I'm a metallic man about to blow
Time to set the record straight
Time to let out all my hate

I'm on a mission
A metallic man
With intention to
Expose the plan
I was born and plated
A schmuck they created

I'll explode
I'll erode
Yeah I'll break your fucking code
'Cause I'm an automatic schmuck
With a tendency to rock

I'm on a mission
A metallic goof
It takes a man of steel
To reveal the truth
I was born and plated
A schmuck they created

I'll explode
I'll erode
Yeah I'll break your fucking code
'Cause I'm an automatic schmuck

I'll explode
I'll erode
Yeah I'll break your fucking code
I'll explode
I'll erode
Yeah I'll break your fucking code...
