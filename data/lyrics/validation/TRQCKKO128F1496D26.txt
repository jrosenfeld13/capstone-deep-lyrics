Can't see the picture when you're always in my way
Can't find myself inside, it's all a memory
If I light a candle for you, it won't ease my mind
Miss you when you're not here, I just ran out of time

I can watch the sun rising, but it don't mean much to me
Another winter's coming and I can't take the heat

Can't believe, you left it so oh open in the breeze
Really took your time to understand your every need
I'm not interested in the inequalities
I'm gonna take my time, I'm gonna set it up for free

I can watch the sun rising, but it don't mean much to me
Another winter's coming and I can't take the heat
Another winter's coming and I can't take the heat
