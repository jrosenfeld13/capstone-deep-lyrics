I forgot more than you'll ever know about him
You think you know the smile on his lips
The thrill of his touch of his fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about him
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
In each weak caress, in each tender kiss
Oh, but I forgot more than you'll ever know about him
You stole his love from me one day
You didn't care how much you hurt me
But you'll never steal away
The memories of what used to be
You think that he's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when his love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about him
Yes I've forgot more than you'll ever know about him
