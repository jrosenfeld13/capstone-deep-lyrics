You wanna know where legends live?
At the rainbow's end Ill be there
Theres a place in inner space
Thats where I'll get to you
Im not the shy retiring kind
Like a supernova for the blind
I used to sit at God's right hand
But I quit that show to do my one night stands

Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...

[Chorus:]
You wont see my face no more
My machine has left the floor
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt
Before I leave and go my way
I've loved it but I couldnt stay
Theres nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me...

You might see me in Tokyo
To the rings of Saturn hey... let's go
And you can trip all the lights with me
But your one time chance is never free
I'll see you baby once again
Maybe 3 score years and ten
Ill be driving a different ship
That's when I'll take you down, for your final trip

Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...

[Chorus:]
You wont see my face no more
My machine has left the floor
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt
Before I leave and go my way
I've loved it but I couldnt stay
Theres nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me...

[solo]

Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...
Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...

[Chorus:]
You wont see my face no more
My machine has left the floor
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt
Before I leave and go my way
I've loved it but I couldnt stay
Theres nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me...
