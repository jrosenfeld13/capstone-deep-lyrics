[Verse 1]
Hold on to me, love
You know I can't stay long
All I wanted to say was
"I love you and I'm not afraid"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me in your arms?

[Chorus]
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears

[Chorus]
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight

[Verse 3]
Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here
But still you wake and know the truth
No one is there

Say goodnight
Don't be afraid
Calling me, calling me
As you fade to black

[Bridge]
(Say goodnight) Holding my last breath
(Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself
(Calling me, calling me) Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight

[Chorus]
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight

[Outro]
(Holding my last breath)
