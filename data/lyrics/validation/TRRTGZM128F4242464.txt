Exalt who denounces this fading kingdom
Dethroned trinity, embellished divine power
Malicious transgressor to purge the holy

Unleashed to lay waste
The son of man

A messiah to endure the cross of our defiance

A messiah to endure the cross of our defiance
Lead to desolation...christ's congregation

[repeat 1st verse]
