[Intro]
You were a face in the crowd
I threw myself onto you
I tried to take you away
I didn't know how to do
But I could not give you the most
Some things I said were never true

Yet still we clung to a ghost
I feel so bad you never knew

I felt like you should know but I could not tell you so

[Chorus 1]
When you walked away I breathed your name
As you walked away
As you walked away
We can never get back what we choose to throw away
When you walked away I breathed your name
As you walked away
As you walked away
We can never get back what we choose to throw away

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to hold onto something
That seems determined to grow by the day
Every time I think I can handle
You only seem to get further away
I never realized just how hard it was for a person like me to do
For a person like me to do

[Chorus 2]
When you walked away I breathed your name
As you walked away
As you walked away
We can never get back what we choose to throw away
When you walked away I breathed your name
As you walked away
As you walked away
We can never get back what we choose to throw away

[Verse 2]
I couldn't watch you wishing for something
That seemed more impossible by the day
Anytime I saw your expression
I only seemed to run farther away
I never realized just how hard it was for a person like me to do

[Bridge]
Obsessed with thoughts that deform
Held on by hope too well worn
Crippled because of dreams that eclipse reality
Crashing into truths we don't perceive
We don't perceive

I couldn't hold on to the things that mattered to you
It was my big mistake
Thinking there were two roads to take

[Piano Solo]

[Outro]
As you walked away (as you walked away)
As you walked away (as you walked away)
As you walked away (as you walked away)
As you walked away
As you walked away
