You are not anyone
Don't sadden my life

You got to leave on Sunday night
It seems I'll feel all alone
You know the tears are in my eyes
I need some time to let 'em dry

I can't keep insisting 'cause I'm going too far
I feel sad and that is just for you
I would keep insisting on these lonely nights
'Cause I just can't get rid of you

You are just not anyone, anyone
I just wanna keep in touch
Don't sadden my life
You are just not anyone, anyone
I don't wanna lose your touch
Don't sadden my life

I don't know if you're wrong or right
I need somebody to love
You know I'm always on your side
So please don't let it fall apart

I can't keep insisting 'cause I'm going too far
I feel sad and that is just for you
I would keep insisting on these lonely nights
'Cause I just can't help but thinking of you

You are just not anyone, anyone
I just wanna keep in touch
Don't sadden my life
I wanna be the one, be the one
I don't wanna lose your touch
Don't sadden my life
