Well, I'm not totally sure of these lyrics cause I'm a french girl, so just correct me if I'm wrong...
The first moment you hesitate
Better ask yourself why
Don't you quit until it's too late
Until something inside has died
When you're paralized
No directions at all
Found out some way apart
Now there's only space to fall
When you're losing
Even if you know the rules
Cause it's a game for fools
The first moment you hesitate
Better ask yourself why
Don't you quit until it's too late
Until something inside has died
Yeah it's easy down the light
To make a map of your lies
You can't keep on keeping the truth
Where the sky
Like ten(?)like it was all right
And it was all wrong
And if you wasted so much time
For ever trying to make up your mind
Now it's clear
You should have just moved on
Simply packed your past and go yeah
Cause the first moment you hesitate
You can kiss those plans goodbye
Don't you quit until it's too late
Or something inside might die
When you know yeah you know all the rules
Must been playing the game for fools
Congratulations, yeah you're winning
The game for fools yeah
