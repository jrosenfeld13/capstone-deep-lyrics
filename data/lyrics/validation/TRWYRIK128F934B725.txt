Oblivious in high spirits like any other day
Masked man waiting at the doorstep
For three of one to slay
Welcome home
Welcome back
Welcome to your brutal end
A violent force sweeps over them
In a second all turns black
Three of one! Three of one!
One alive and three undone
Two on the wall, third on the floor
For they are three of one!
Three Of One!
Terrorizing slaughterhouse
When executing three of one
Dear lord what is this madness?
Am I still alive?!
Poor bastard stuck in hell --
A fate much worse than death
Horrified -- Terrified
Dead bodies all around
Confusion and nausea
Like needles to the brain
Three of one! Three of one!
One alive and three undone
Two on the wall, third on the floor
For they are three of one!
Three Of One!
Terrorizing slaughterhouse
When executing three of one
Nailed to the wall
Ripped upside down
Strapped on the floor
Not making a sound...
Not a sound
Three of one! Three of one!
One alive and three undone
Two on the wall, third on the floor
For they are three of one!
Three Of One!
Terrorizing slaughterhouse
When executing three of one
