I saw a man break down on New Year's Eve
Drop to his knees and cry hysterically
Screaming nonsense you would not believe
On the sidewalk right in front of me

And I asked him Mr. what's the matter
Calm down are you alright
Looks like you could use a doctor
And how much have you had to drink tonight

Remember this is just a temporary trip
If you stay down too long you can sometimes lose your grip

I helped him get back on his feet again
And brushed the slush off his overcoat
He wiped his eyes he shook my hand and then
Before he walked away he sadly cleared his throat

Then he said son I'm just old and lonely
But thank you for your concern
Here's wishing you a Happy New Year
I wished him one back in return

Remember this is just a temporary trip
If you stay down too long you can sometimes lose your grip
