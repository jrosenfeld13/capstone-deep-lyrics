Are you for or against us
We are trying to get somewhere
Looking around for a helping hand

We're doing our best to keep it steady
But it's falling down around us
Blows keep coming fast and strong

I done found another fellow
He agrees with my direction
Arms around each others shoulders we go everywhere

Are you in, are you out
Are you in, are you out
Are you in, are you out
Are you in, are you out
Do you care to dance about and shout
Join Jack and the boys
Be in a band
Doing a one night stand

We'll be dancing in the floodlight
Second to none
Not even on a bad night
Dancing in the floodlight
Second to none
Not even on a bad night

We'll succeed where others failed
Stay together many years
And watch us take the world by storm

Are you in, are you out
Do you care to dance about and shout
Join Jack and the boys
Be in a band
Doing the one night stands
