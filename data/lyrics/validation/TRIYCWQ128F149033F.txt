My home's in Montana, I wear a bandana
My spurs are silver, my horse is a bay
And I've been a-roamin' all over Wyomin'
There's plenty of work, but there ain't too much pay

Me and a few boys we signed on at Dubois
To feed through the winter and camp out awhile
Come a hard hittin' norther from the Montana border
We tallied the frozen ones mile after mile

Well they give you your three squares and a bunk to sleep there
And just enough wages to keep you around
But with no place to spend it and nowhere to send it
You can stay out of debt if you stay out of town

It's horses and cattle and a double rig saddle
With a stout line, a catch twine, and a good ropin' arm
Wherever there's ranches, I've been takin' my chances
From sunrise to sunset since the day I was born

We struck out for Laramie early one Saturday
Spring was a breakin' the grass turnin' green
Well, I took a hand in some fast movin' brandin'
When they offered top wages at the Bar Seventeen

We followed a rodeo clear up to Codeo
Tryin' to ride me a bronco or two
Well, I busted some hosses for two or three bosses
And lost all the wages that ever I drew

Well it's hell and high water for the Idaho border
Where I've got a gal if that letter don't lie
If she gives me a reason to stay through the season
I'll take her to Elko when the snow starts to fly

It's horses and cattle and a double rig saddle
With a stout line, a catch twine, and a good ropin' arm
Wherever there's ranches, I've been takin' my chances
From sunrise to sunset since the day I was born
