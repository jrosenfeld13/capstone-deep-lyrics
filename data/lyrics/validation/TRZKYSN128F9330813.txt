Ooohh yeah, ooohhooooo
Ohhh, hoooo bayaaayyyyyy
Ooooohhhoooooo
Eeeeeeewwwwww, eeewww, eeww, ew!

I wasn't scared of love, til I met you
I did everything that you wanted me to
You're love was so demanding
You left me out here standing

I hid those tears for as long as I could
Try to stop me now, I wish you would!
You think you have me, baby
You must be so damn(ed) crazy

My joy, unh(and), my pain
Things you don't understand
This love in my hand
Something I never planned
So far away, baby, it's just too late
Cause you don't know how to appreciate

I wasn't kidding when I said I loved you, baby
Wedding bells stop ringing around here lately
You gave up on this love, cause you thought, maybe
But, you're gonna miss my love always

I never thought that pain could be this(that) cruel
And to think it all came from you
You met me with love's flame
Tryin' na tell me I was insane

What made you think I'd stay forever?
It was always me who kept us together
Mmmm, messed up, ya heard me! Oh yeah!
The truth is, you don't deserve me
My joy, unh (and), my pain, things you don't understand

This love in my hand
Something I never planned
So far away, baby, it's just too late
Cause you don't know how to appreciate

I wasn't kidding when I said I loved you, baby
Wedding bells stop ringing around here lately
You gave up on this love, cause you thought, maybe
But, you're gonna miss my love always

I hate to announce what's on my mind
But, why couldn't love work out this time?
You know you can't dim this love that shine's
I'm outta here baby, I'm no longer your lady

I wasn't kidding when I said I loved you, baby
Wedding bells stop ringing around here lately
You gave up on this love, cause you thought, maybe
But, you're gonna miss my love always
