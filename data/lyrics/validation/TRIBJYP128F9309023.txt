Tell Ma, she's a stonebreaker
Tell her there are no takers
For a heart like this will always be
Chaste at first, then left for me
And though your pallor shows instinct
And all our lives are worth
That stint you did with that man of mine
But lady-luck, her needs divine

'Cos I'm courted by the mourning sun y'know
We shine all the picture palace shows
They used to make you feel so real
But now you go trickling
'Til you steal a moment by yourself
When the people don't come and need your help
When the people don't come with pseudo sights
To tell you how to live your life
Now you can live your life with this life of mine
'Cos I'm feeling guilty and I need some time
To explain the things that I gotta do
'Cos more or less
I owe it all to you

Tell all to the sweet keeper
As you and you're much deeper
In debt it's always nice to be
With the closest like the family
And when you hit on a great line y'know
And when you've opened up your soul
But every girl who's counting the day
Isn't cold - but she just needs to say

'Cos I'm courted by the mourning sun y'know
We shine all the picture palace shows
They used to make you feel so real
But now you go trickling
'Til you steal a moment by yourself
When the people don't come and need your help
When the people don't come with pseudo sights
To tell you how to live your life
Now you can live your life with this life of mine
'Cos I'm feeling guilty and I need some time
To explain the things that I gotta do
'Cos more or less
I owe it all to you

And hiding in the lost country
I know I gotta way to go
And though you still fmay find me
At least my garden grows
