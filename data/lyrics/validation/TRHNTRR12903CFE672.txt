Wintertime is our time. The low sun flickering through railings
Piccadilly and coffee cups. Looking through the eyes of love
Wintertime is our time. Moonlight on snow. It's where we were born, it's home
It's where we were born, it's home

And now that you're finally in my arms to stay, there is no ache
No longing, no sense of loss, when the cold air whispers all about us
Of you of me, of us

A bench by the channel. A cave by a castle
Places we tried to say goodbye. Someone new to miss
A tentative gift. The first butterflies, the first butterflies

And now that you're finally in my arms to stay, there is no ache
No longing, no sense of loss, when the cold air whispers all about us
Of you of me, of us

That promise I made, I was never going to keep it
Wasn't there always hope? Or is that just me, rewriting history?
Is it easy to say that now, there's no taxi cab to bring us down?
Now that the time that's ours doesn't have to feel like it's running out

And now that you're finally in my arms to stay, there is no ache
No longing, no sense of loss, when the cold air whispers all about us
Of you of me, of us

Moonlight on snow
