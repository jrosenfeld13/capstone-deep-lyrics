[Intro][x2]
What would I do
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain
I can't choose

[Verse 1]
Wake up
You're dreaming
I can't stand your screaming
Drowning out these prayers
Just some words without meaning

[Interlude]
Spare all the breaching
My secrets worth keeping
No one understands like I do

[Verse 2]
Keep out of reach
I'm your leading deletion
Hide behind these masks
Though they still see right through them

[Pre-Chorus]
Every now and then
You're down and out my friend
Down and out again [x3]
But I'm down with you

[Chorus]
One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe

[Bridge]
Blame it on you, thought these years I've been losing
Blame it on the past, it's the last place I know you
Blame all the children, they're raging and ruined
Blame it on the black and the blue

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the very last time
Everyone wants to believe, all right
