[Full verse: Pete Philly]

Sometimes I feel conflicted and restricted in my ways
Ups and downs, manic in a state of panic, in a rage
Ready to flip the page
But I can't seem to get of it still remain a kid
I aim to get the respect, the props and the money that I need
I bleed to get out of my shitty apartment
A beat and rhyme is what I start with
I part quick, with non-believers under achievers and overcapitalized money retrievers
And yet I still understand
Within this masterplan, feel that life is going faster man
I feel like I'm out of luck and stuck in a plastercan
And even when I'm up, I'm waiting for disaster man
Then I pass a can of juice to one of my peers
Realize he got the same aspirations and fears
And then there's a solid reason for these blood, sweat and tears
The chaos in my head becomes clear, the sun appears
And the tears just wash away
I look forward to a new day ands pray for some inspiration
Before I know it my hand starts to write on it's own
I'm in the zone, it's on!
Yeah, I look forward to a new day and pray for some inspiration
Before I know it my hand starts to write on it's own
I'm in the zone, it's on, it's on, it's on!
