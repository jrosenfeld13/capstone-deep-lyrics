Will you still be here with me
Or you gonna leave with the moonlight
Morning comes Ill need you most
To hold you more than close through the night

Chorus:
Midnight love affair
How can I make you to stay
Midnight love affair
Please dont run away

I really should be going
Tonight well share a sweet thing
You better get my loving while you can
Dont let me wake up lonely
I need you arms to hold me
Without you Id be only half a man

Feels so good it cant be wrong
To love you all night long
Please stay here with me
I aint gonna fall asleep
Ill do anything to keep you near to me

Repeat Chorus

Its been a lovely evening
But soon I must be leaving
Ive heard those tender words I loved before
Well spent the night together
Well make love last forever
I only want to love you more and more

Repeat Chorus

Midnight love affair
I need you around
