[Hook]
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!

[Verse 1]
I'm enlisting, overseas aid
Need assisting, help with a maid
Get the expert on mademoiselles
He could diffuse any bombshell

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes

[Chorus]
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

[Hook]
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!

[Verse 2]
I'm invading territories
Girls are foreign and strange to me
Get the expert at kissing and stuff
Well, he stays easy when things get rough

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes

[Chorus]
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

[Bridge]
Sometimes relationships don't go as planned
Some girls can make themselves so cold
A no man's land

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes

[Chorus]
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
Make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

[Hook]
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey!
