Another year has gone by
Time just took that away
Friends have changed
Clear skies watched over us
But we've had our share of rain
Romance still sits untouched
By the water she waits patiently
Hoping I'll take her home someday, someday
To think I lost her that my dreams were her only place
But for her I've learned to wait
One smile remains on my face
Knowing God hold her at night
Letting her know
I'm on my way
So I'll hold my head high for love
May be a day, I can't say
But tomorrow awaits
Bringing me closer to you
