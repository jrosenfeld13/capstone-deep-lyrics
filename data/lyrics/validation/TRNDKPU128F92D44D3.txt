I can't believe you want to leave so soon
The party's just begun now, don't go away
The music is sweet for your dancin' pleasure
Baby, has no measure

Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money

Please Mr. DJ, play this song for me
Please Mr. DJ, please, play this song for me again
The music has got me rockin' in my soul now
Oh Lord, I pray now I'll never go old now

Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money

Please Mr. DJ, play this song for me
Please Mr. DJ, please, play this song for me again
The music has got me rockin' in my soul now
Oh Lord, I pray now I'll never go old now

Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
Swing and dine and dance for your money
