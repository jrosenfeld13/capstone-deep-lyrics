People think I'm being perverse on purpose
But they don't know

You tried to give me your heart
But her fingermarks
Were all over it
I tried to look impressed
It was as futile a gesture
As a futile gesture, futile gesture gets

Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
If you don't plan to be around five minutes later
Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
And don't just say the things that you think I want to hear

You were there to fill my time
It was dark (but you)
But you had nice eyes
I wasn't too impressed
You hadn't told me anything
Anything amusing yet

Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
If you don't plan to be around five minutes later
Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
And don't just say the things that you think I want to hear

It's hard enough getting someone to like you
And then you find out that they're nothing like you
And it's been a waste of time

"Girls fantasise on school trips to galleries
Of men who don't meet their parents' expectations
Who want to introduce them to illicit Russ Meyer films
And dance 'til dawn to old Kinks records
These are the things you don't understand
Quarter to ten, you're wasting your time
If you want to know me, watch how I dance."

Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
If you don't plan to be around five minutes later
Don't be a sycophant and don't try to hold my hand
And don't just say the things that you think I want to hear

It's hard enough getting someone to like you
And then you find out that they're nothing like you
And it's been a waste of time
