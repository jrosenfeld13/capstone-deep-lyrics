I've been following women all afternoon
I've been following women all afternoon
Don't turn around
Too soon
I've been following you all afternoon
Following you a fool in the full moon
Something's got a hold on me when I get a hold of you
Following women
After dark
Nobody knows what's in my heart
Let your loving be
I'm a lechery
I do not spread leprosy
I will not touch but let me see
My building's burning down and i cannot breathe
Following you
Who won't believe
Perfect peace I cannot perceive
When I'm following you I'm a fool in the full moon
