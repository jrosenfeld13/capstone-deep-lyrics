Friday night, I feel all right (*)
I get into my leathers
And I get out on my bike

There's thunder in my ears
It's blasting down...
Kickin' up brick
I don't give a shit
I got the wind in my hair
You know I don't even care
Stallions of the highway

Switchblade's gleamin'
Engine screamin'
I'm laughin' at fate
I'm living to hate
My needle is showing red
I'm ridin' with the dead
Get out of my way
I'm a stallion of the highway

I got the wind in my hair
I don't even care
I broke out of my shell
I'm on a daydream from hell
Don't shed no tears
I been here fifteen years

(Repeat *)

My needle is showing red
I'm ridin' with the dead
Get out of my way
I got the wind in my hair
I don't even care
Stallions of the highway
Of the highway
