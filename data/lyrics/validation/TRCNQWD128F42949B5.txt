Once upon a time, a girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time, very long ago

Once upon a time, we sat beneath the willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree has gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time, the world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours ' how happy we were then
But, somehow, once upon a time never comes again
