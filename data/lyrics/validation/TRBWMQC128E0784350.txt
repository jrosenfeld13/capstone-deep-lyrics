Treat me wrong
Treat me right
Do me now baby
Tell me lies, but oh hold me tight

Save your goodbyes for the morning light
Lord I dont wanna be lonely tonight

Come and say hello
Come and say goodbye
Sure good enough to see you
Apart when its time to go

Dont say ends, but but but please
Dont say Lord I dont wanna be lonely tonight

Gonna whale down your ha heart
Im gonna do as you please
Gonna do as you please, girl
You aint gonna see me getting down on my knees

Cos my heart has been divided, ooh
And my souls been excited
Youve been turning my world upside down
More baby

Come and say hello
Come and say goodbye
Sure good enough to see you
Apart when its time to go

Dont say ends, but but but please
Dont say Lord I dont wanna be lonely tonight

Oh babe

I dont wanna be lonely tonight
I dont wanna be lonely tonight
Woh Woh, I dont wanna be lonely tonight
