We're the 3rd from the sun
We're a beacon and a 7th wonder
We are green and we are glowing
We're the one and eternal mother
We're a fleet among stars
We're a homeworld in constant changes
We are stardust and we're sun kissed
We are brothers and still we're strangers
Is there someone out there - who rise above the stars
Who can tell us who we are
Are we blood of Eden - Ah no - What's our key to freedom?
With a king at your door
You were sleeping with one eye open
Now they're waiting in your backyard
No replacement for a lifeline broken
Is there someone out there - who rise above the stars
Who can tell us who we are
Are we blood of Eden - Ah no - What's our key to freedom?
Is the sun still out there - to rise above the stars
Take the wayward children home
To the banks of Eden - where Kings hold court
We're the key to freedom!
We are clueless and cold - hanging on a thread
We could be much more - but we're just not ready
So we're killing time and we close our eyes
We're that one trick pony - waiting on a sign
We're that one trick pony - looking for a sign
