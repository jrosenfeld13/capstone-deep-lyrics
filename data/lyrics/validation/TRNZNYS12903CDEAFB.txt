Fantasy fantasy fantasy fantasy

When I saw you standin' there I knew you see
That you were glad to be the one for me yeah
When I saw you walkin' home alone each day
I had to say what I felt girl
So listen now it's plain to see

Fantasy yes it's fantasy
And we'll stay together yes together wait and see
It's only fantasy always fantasy
Oh we'll stay together yes together now
And now you wait and see yes it's fantasy
You and me you and me

Fantasy fantasy fantasy fantasy

When I think of all the little things you do
To try and show to let me know you love me
I'll remember sitting all alone that day
As you walk by my heart felt high
I'm glad to say it's plain to see

Fantasy yes it's fantasy
And we'll stay together yes together
Wait and see
It's only fantasy always fantasy
Oh we'll stay together yes together now
And now you wait and see yes it's fantasy
You and me you and me
