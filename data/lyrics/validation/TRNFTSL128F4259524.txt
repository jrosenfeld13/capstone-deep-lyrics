Looking for that Paradise
That I dreamt of years ago
Now I'm walking through this dark long empty street
Do I really give it all
To say I tried if I fall?
Many long years walking but I'm always here

And it feels like I waste my life away
We're like soldiers just walking in the rain
And even if we're going nowhere
We still have our dreams
Gotta believe

Sometimes when I'm losing faith
I stop running to watch you live
Handling with those things that I will never know
Am I really happy now?
Do I really have what I want?
I wish that someday I could be the same as you

And it feels like I waste my life away
We're like flowers just standing in the rain
And even if we're losing this war
We still have our dreams
Gotta believe

Even if we're going nowhere
We won't give up this long walk
We won't let this hard life break our dreams

And it feels like I waste my life away
We're like flowers just walking in the rain
And even if we're going nowhere
We still have our dreams
And even if we're losing this war
We still have our dreams
