High as kites
Making that medicine
Jawing with the dead and gone

Come spirit, pick me up
I need a lift, a cloven tongue
To sit atop my head
And make sense of the things Ive said

Tonight we just dont care
Throw caution to the wind we dare
Our ignorance is bliss
Well save our best for worse than this

High as kites
Making that medicine
Jawing with the dead and gone

Holy Ghost
Brother its a weapon
Im walking on the devils backbone
Home

Our road is paved with sage advice
We tell ourselves to ease the mind
Thats burdened down

We see our faults to a fault
Lord save us from your followers
I always thought itd finally stop
That place the hands of time forgot

High as kites
Making that medicine
Jawing with the dead and gone

Holy Ghost
Brother its a weapon
Im walking on the devils backbone
Home

But I was stupid
Ive been careless (Holy)
The wordless gurgle
Tongues of Babel (Holy Ghost)
