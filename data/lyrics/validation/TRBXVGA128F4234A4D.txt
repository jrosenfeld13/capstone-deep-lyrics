Given a choice to make
Inside a veil, shadowed in secrecy
Trained dark eyes follow an enemy
I watch them knowing that they belong to me
I am Black Widow
And I act in respect of those before
I am Black Widow
Spare me the dignity
Of the thousands that died before
Am I your chosen one?
To tread the path that so many have walked before
Am I a fool or a martyr?
Is my reflection a vision of right or wrong?
Am I a fool or a martyr?
Am I remembered or am I frowned upon?
I am Black Widow
And I act in the memory of those before
I am Black Widow
Never seen
Never showing
My face is a mystery
None shall follow
My path leads me to
Send love to my family
They will be proud of the missions embarked upon
I will be judged by my Master
He knows so well that I follow his command
And the blood is on your hands
It is the blood of the brothers that died before
I will repay my sisters
I will be saviour of all those that died before
I am Black Widow
And I act in respect of those before
I am Black Widow
