If you offered me a shade of blue
Would I return it saying that it was too
Dark or light?
Or would I see it for the precious thing
That it might one day be?
Hold on to me

If you offered me a point of view
Would I dismiss it saying that it was too
Black and white?
Or would I see it as the special thing
That it would no doubt be?
Hold on to me

I'll hold on to this gift we share
It is as slippery as it is rare
I'll hold on to that feeling
Of waking and finding you there
I'll hold on to you and you hold on to me

If I asked you for a simple thing

Would you do it without too much thinking or fuss?
Would you see it for the precious thing
That it would surely be?
Hold on to me

Hold on to me
Hold on to me
