[Spoken transmissions:]
Do you hear me out there?
I can hear you
I got you I can hear you alright
This is so strange
I want to wish for something new
This is the scariest thing I've ever done in my life
Who do we think we are?
We're Angels & Airwaves
Just hold on I got you
I can see the sun coming up on the horizon

[Verse 1:]
Everyone, everyone will listen
Even if it hurts sometimes
If you will, come and hear the message
Everyone wants to learn to love again
Open up and come alive if you will
Can you hear my message?
Leave your pain on the bedroom floor again
Bring a smile to survive
And do you think that you have that in you
If you're here and you're all alone tonight
Then I'll give you a free ride
Take a chance cause I know you want to

[Chorus:]
If only you'll hold on, just hold on
I'm here and I'm with you
I'm here too, I feel you
We'll get through
I know this, I've seen it
A hundred times, a thousand times
Just one more time
With you and I, I'll pull you close
And then we'll say goodbye

[Verse 2:]
I've got a lotta, whole hell of a lot to say
Even if it hurts sometimes
And if you will come and hear the message
And everyone, everyone will hope and pray
That the best will sure survive
And if it's true then you'll feel the message
A perfect life for a perfect brand new day
And we're the next in line
And do you think that you have it in you
So if you're here and you're curious tonight
Then I'll give you a free ride
Take a chance cause I know you want to

[Chorus:]
If only you'll hold on, just hold on
I'm here and I'm with you
I'm here too, I feel you
We'll get through
I know this, I've seen it
A hundred times, a thousand times
Just one more time
With you and I, I'll pull you close
And then we'll say goodbye

Who do we think we are?
