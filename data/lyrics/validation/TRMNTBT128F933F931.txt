I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do
I ain't' lying, no I ain't lying

You know I can't stand it
The way you're running round
You know I can't stand it mamma
The way you put me down
So I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

Do I love ya
Do I love ya
Do I love ya
Do I love ya any how
And I don't care
I don't care if you don't want me
Because I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

(guitar solo)

You know I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it when you put me down
You ought to no better mamma
I can't stand a women run around
I put a spell on you
Because
Because you're mine
