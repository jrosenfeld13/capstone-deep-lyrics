Behind the wheel.. some told
Their turn.. realizing what's in store
Hardly known... under the lift
Seems like forever.. since I seen one like this!
Seldom wrong.. narrow ride
Turning towards.. ain't ever seen inside
One on the floor... one out the door
Ain't nothing left just like we heard before
Take the turn go the ride
Unlike before, this happens everytime
Locate the sound ...from the star
Get to work gonna take this thing apart

(chorus)
The transmission begins
The crowd silent grins
The transmission begins
The crowd silent grins

Lights fade lost sound
Easy ride... drive into the ground
1,000 plays behind the wheel
Turning slow gonna make the final deal
Roll the dice, lost the round
Through my head theyll never understand
As they lay engine dies
Time still as they come in from the sky

(chorus)
Quick turn away...I see them again
No explain the sound...Must be the end
Looks like hell on earth..ain't no figurine
A clumsy ride is all....went by unseen
Quick turn away...I see them again
No explain the sound...Must be the end

Behind the wheel..or so I'm told
Your turn... realizin what's instore
Hardly know..under the lift
Seems like forever.. since I heard one like this!
