Space
Seems like it 's organized
Against me
But I, victim of gravity
Can fly
When you lie next to me

I feel so strong
I feel so safe
Lost puzzle pieces
Fall in place
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me

I can't be superman
But I
I'll do the best I can
For
Each other we seem to be
Made
When you lie next to me

I feel so strong
I feel so safe
Lost puzzle pieces
Fall in place
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me

And when we're tired
We drift
Away to sleep
And you're the dream
That's worth remembering

I feel so strong
I feel so safe
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me
(repeat)
