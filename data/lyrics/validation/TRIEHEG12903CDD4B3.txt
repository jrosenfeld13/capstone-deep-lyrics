They're teasing me
And we're still here
In Great Portland Street
In a phone call with you

Take me down
Every day in the Fall
Could have been earlier
I'm weak from this and you cannot see

Stupid me
The entire world knows
That some days are longer
Than a phone call

Take me down (Take me all the way)
Every day in the Fall (Every day in Fall)
Could have been earlier (Take me, take me down)
I'm weak from this and you cannot see

They're teasing me
And we're still here
In Great Portland Street
In a phone call with you

Take me down (Take me all the way)
Every day in the Fall (Every day in Fall)
Can it be earlier? (Take me, take me down)
I'm weak from this, and you ... (Take me, take me down)
I'm weak from this, and you ... (Take me, take me down)
I'm weak from this
