God tricked again it`s all good news
I just want to sleep oh i`m thru oh i`m thru
Stay laid there submission is great ah ah
Oscar wilde was right and tonight
Was right and tonight
Ten hundred faces might be wrong might be right
Oh i love to complain the new way of life
Don`t you hate to talk and explain
To talk and explain
Crashing in my car
Makes me smile seven times a day
Seven times a day
Yes yes yes yes i love to complain
Not now not now i`m drinking in bed
Yes yes yes i love to complain
Some things are easy to explain
Not now not now i`m drinking in bed
