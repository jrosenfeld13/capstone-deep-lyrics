The walls are thin, the voices echo through her silent room
A door slams shut, the shouting follows soon
Those deafening familiar screams

Alcoholic haze, lipstick trace a place where lights are low
While mother can't pretend she doesn't know
Hearing all the retread lies
Banning all the reasons why

Bloody mary, can't find her way home
Bloody mary, can't do what she's told
Bloody mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....

Run away, no one cares if you live or why
Lie on your back and watch the virgin die
Daddy's little girl is gone forever more
Banging on a stone cold door

Bloody mary, can't find her way home
Bloody mary, can't do what she's told
Bloody mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....

Razor blades, cut deep into the wrist of emptiness
In a suicidal rage of attentions missed
No one knew you didn't know yourself
Still no one heard your cry for help

Bloody mary, can't find her way home
Bloody mary, can't do what she's told
Bloody mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here

Bloody mary, we didn't want you anyway
Bloody mary, we didn't ever know what to say
Bloody mary, won't you please go away
Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here...
