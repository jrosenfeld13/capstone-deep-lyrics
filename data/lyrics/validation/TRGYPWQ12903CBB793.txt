The end in us is a sleeping crowd
I love youth
Im to sleep every night
And we follow indecisions, working out for labyrinths
And all the glimpse of talent  I like
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to
I guess Ill ... awake until old daddy sleeps away
Away, away, away

I guess Ill fight awake until old daddy sleeps away
A way, a way, a way
I get to see the light
And until the shiver comes, Ill wait, Ill wait, I'll wait
Dying first into the tragic
Love and lies have moved in here to stay, to stay, to stay!
