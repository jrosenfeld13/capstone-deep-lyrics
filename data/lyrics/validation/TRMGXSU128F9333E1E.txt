This world's not my home
I'm a stranger to the storm
Save me, save me
Where the race is quickest
The tide runs strong
Save me, save me
A big sky above me
West winds blow
Sailing long distance
Breaking the foam

There's a lighthouse
Shining in the black
A lighthouse
Standing in the dark
All the world's a ship
Shipwrecked on the seas
Breaking up in pieces
We're clinging to the reef
There's a lighthouse

There's a sky full of trouble
Lifetimes and fear
Save me, save me
Talking the soundings
Now the tempest is here
Save me, save me
And daylight is breaking
On out-stretched hands
Lost on the ocean
Reaching for land

There's a lighthouse
Shining in the black
A lighthouse
Standing in the dark
All the world's a ship
Shipwrecked on the seas
Breaking up in pieces
We're clinging to the reef
There's a lighthouse

There's a lighthouse
Shining in the black
A lighthouse
Standing in the dark
All the world's a ship
Shipwrecked on the seas
Breaking up in pieces
We're clinging to the reef
There's a lighthouse

A lighthouse
A lighthouse

Holdin' on (repeat three times)

You got to keep
Holdin' on
Holdin' on

Oh
Holdin' on
Holdin' on

Oh, you got to keep
Holdin' on (repeat three times)

You got to keep
Holdin' on (repeat three times)
