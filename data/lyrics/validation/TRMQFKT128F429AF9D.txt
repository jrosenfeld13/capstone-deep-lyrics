"the way you look at us
You think you have it figured out (wasting away)
Or it seems that way to you...
But who are you to take what we love, and pick at it
'til it seems like it's falling apart?
Endless days in a van, countless petty arguments
Hopeless cries, and laughing to try and make the time pass by (broken down)
It seems like everyone's against us
To most it seems like it's not going anywhere
But to who it matters most, there's still hope
These friendships filled with dreams, filled with love
There's too much sweat and tears...the sacrifice we've put into this
For some to look at us and laugh, they don't...
They don't understand
We've taken on every obstacle full force
It's in our hearts, we can't let go...we can't let go"
