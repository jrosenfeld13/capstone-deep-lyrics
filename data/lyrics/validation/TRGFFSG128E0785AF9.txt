There's a girl on channel 13
I know she's gonna fall in love with me
And I'm gonna win the lottery tomorrow
Or the next day
I drive a Mercedes Benz
Ive got a whole butt load of friends
I'm gonna be on CMT someday

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
And in my real world
I'm a little messed up and broke, don't you know

I got more money then George Strait
I throw benjies out the window all day
Just to see how far they fly, bye bye
I get more girls then the president
Mom and dad still pay the rent
And I throw parties all night long

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
And in my real world
I'm a little messed up and broke, don't you know

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
And in my real world
I'm a little messed up and broke, don't you know

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
And in my real world
I'm a little messed up and broke, don't you know
