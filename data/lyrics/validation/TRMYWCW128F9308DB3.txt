I can't quit you, baby
But I've got to put you down for awhile
You know I can't quit you, baby
But I've got to put you down for awhile
Well, you messed up my happy home, babe
Made me mistreat my only child

You know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Yes, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I would never hide
Yes, you know you're the onliest one, darlin'
You're just my heart's desire

Well, I'm so tired I could cry
I could just lay down and die
I'm so tired I could cry
I could just lay down and die
You know I love you, baby
You're just my heart's desire

When you hear me moanin' and groanin', baby
You know it hurts me way down inside
When you hear me moanin' and groanin', baby
You know it hurts me way down inside
Yes, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my heart's desire
