[Verse 1 - Mark Hoppus]
Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Chorus - Mark Hoppus]
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Or do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Verse 2- Mark Hoppus]
The three-date theory's getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Chorus- Mark Hoppus]
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Or do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Bridge- Mark Hoppus]
I'll be moving on
Moving on
Moving on and on and on
Moving on
Moving on
Moving on
Moving on and on and on

[Chorus- Mark Hoppus]
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Or do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Outro- Mark Hoppus]
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
