What would you do if you finally believed in yourself?
But you just don't know your ass from a hole in the ground
So true it's a violation
Hide yourself from the same old memories
Your image is your invitation

There's no time for sleep so mother fucker come on
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey

Prancing through a black hole in the sky from the thirtieth century
So you'll feel like me
You traded in your high school ring
To get away from the pom pom boys and the jock strap girls

Yeah, give me the super pill to make things better
Yeah, the super pill to make everything all right
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
The odyssey
The odyssey
The odyssey

You've been driven by your faceless personality
And your image is your own faceless odyssey
Come on

Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
Welcome to the odyssey
The odyssey
The odyssey
