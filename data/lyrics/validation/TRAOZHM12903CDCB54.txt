Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

MMM heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me thru the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancin' cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishin'
In the river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancin' cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me thru

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancin' cheek to cheek

Cheek to cheek
Mm cheek to cheek
