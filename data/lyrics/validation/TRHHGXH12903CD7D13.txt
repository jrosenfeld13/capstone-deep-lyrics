My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing, but you

My romance

My romance

Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing, but you
