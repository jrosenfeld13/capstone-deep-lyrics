There's a road that's straight and narrow
That the saints have travelled on
Paved with all the tribulations
Of the martyrs that have gone
If you're grateful for their vict'ries
And for showin' us the way
Then give thanks for all your blessin's
Get on your knees and pray

Thank God for ev'ry flower and each tree
Thank God for all the mountains and the seas
Thank God for givin' life to you and me
Wherever you may be, Thank God

In this world of grief and sorrow
Filled with selfishness and greed
There remains the Glory Fountain
To supply our every need
You can find it in the temple
With a welcome on the door
But be sure to count your blessin's
Before you ask for more

Thank God for ev'ry flower and each tree
Thank God for all the mountains and the seas
Thank God for givin' life to you and me
Wherever you may be, Thank God

Be forgivin to the wayward
Like the Master told us to
When He said forgive them Father
For they know not what they do
They would change their way of livin'
If they could but understand
So remember they're your brothers
They need a helpin' hand
