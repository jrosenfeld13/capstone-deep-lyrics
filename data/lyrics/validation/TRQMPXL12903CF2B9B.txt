Crane

My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

My whole world is so alone
My whole world is so alone
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

My whole world is falling down
My whole world is fallen down
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

Gone away, gone away, gone away
