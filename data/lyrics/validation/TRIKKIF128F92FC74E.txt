Haven't seen the mornin'
Haven't gave a fuck
Take back all the bottles
30 pack for luck

Slowly now, problem gone
I'm livin' easy now
Can't afford a better way
Who are you to judge?

All my so-called friends
Don't come around
Pussy-whipped by bitched
Or their jobs got them down

Fuck 'em all anyway
I've got a life to waste
I'm past the point of getting help
Might as well not stop

Drunk in the daylight
And I feel like I rule my world
Caught a buzz on monday
And rode it through til sunday
Can't say I'm mad at my life

The unemployment check is in
I'm getting buzzed with Bags and Balls
Walking up to the corner
It doesn't get better than this
