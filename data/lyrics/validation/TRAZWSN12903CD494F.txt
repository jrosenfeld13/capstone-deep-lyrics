Parked at the dark end of your street
I'm sticking to my vinyl seat
I got my big old spy scope out
I'm sneaking right up to your house

My golfshirt is tatter and torn
I've been wearing this thing for so long
It's been ... I don't have a clue
It's been ... I still want you

I'm climbing up your apple tree
With my giant spy scope i can see
I'm watching you flossing on your teeth
I bet your mouth is really sweet ... and minty

My golfshirt is tatter and torn
I've been wearing this thing for so long
It's been ... I don't have a clue
It's been ... I still want you

You... I still want you
I still want you
