Go on and pass me by
I don't need your money
I don't need no
Reason why, i'm just gonna leave
I'm just gonna leave

Now i want you to know
You ain't my ride you ain't my jelly roll
If you opened your eyes would ya wonder why
Your head is spinning through the bar room door
And you drive yourself right off a cliff
You walk around with your head in the clouds
And you wonder why it doesn't seem real
I can't understand what you say
When the words are falling outta your mouth
I can't trust you
When you don't even tell the truth about the things
That you do

So go on and try to pretend
That things never happened the way that they do
Well, i could shout it out
But you'll never hear me if you don't know how
This might be the end
The end of this old line that keeps on passin' by
So much more
In the end
