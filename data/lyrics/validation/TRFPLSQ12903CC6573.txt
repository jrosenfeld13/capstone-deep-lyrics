I know what I want and I wanna be with you
There's no need to worry
I know what I did; made you feel like you'd been used
Oh baby, I'm sorry

Well I'd understand if you wanted me to leave
Await your decision
I tried hard to tell you how lonely I had been
But you never listened

I waited so long that I nearly fell asleep
Alone in the bathtub
He told me some girl from your work invited you
To go to a nightclub

I never ever wanted to break your heart
No, I never meant to hurt you at all
All I ever really needed was something real
But I never ever got it, never ever got it

I didn't sleep with your brother
I only let him stay the night. (let him stay the night)
I didn't sleep with your brother
I only held him very tight

It's a hard thing to prove
But I swear it's the truth
He wasn't like you
No, he's not as good as you

No, I never ever wanted to break your heart
No I never meant to hurt you at all
All I ever really needed was something real
And I never ever got it, never ever got it

I didn't sleep with your brother
I only let him stay the night. (let him stay the night)
I didn't sleep with your brother
I only held him very tight

No, I never ever wanted to break your heart
No, I never meant to hurt you at all
All I ever really needed was something real
And I never ever got it, never ever got it

I didn't sleep with your brother
I only let him stay the night. (let him stay the night)
I didn't sleep with your brother
I only held him very tight
