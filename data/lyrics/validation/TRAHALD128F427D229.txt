I see her body move in deadly positions
Her fingers graze my neck for the last time
Her lungs are spilling out
What's keeping me alive?
What's keeping her alive?
Let's see, let's cut off all her long blond hair

Listen sweetie
You never meant that much to me
Hope your eyes can see
What you did to me
You'll always be my enemy

I see the victims of the deadliest poison
My face has turned her skin chalk white
My lungs are spilling out
What's keeping her alive, but was she ever dead?
Let's see, there's footprints trailing out of the morgue

Listen sweetie
You never meant that much to me
Hope your eyes can see
What you did to me
You'll always be my enemy

I see her body move
I watch her body move
She's deadly poison
My only poison
I see her body move
I watch her body move
She's deadly poison
My only poison

Let's see, let's cut off all her long blond hair

Listen sweetie
You never meant that much to me
Hope your eyes can see
What you did to me
You'll always be my enemy
My enemy
My enemy
What you did to me
You'll always be my...

Listen sweetie (I see her body move)
You never meant that much to me (I watch her body move, she's deadly poison, my only poison)
Hope your eyes can see (I see her body move)
What you did to me (I watch her body move)
You'll always be my enemy (She's deadly poison, my only poison)
