Chorus
Jesus
Something special
Supernatural
About your name
Jesus
Something happens
When I mention your name

Demons have to flee when I say Jesus (Jesus)
Sickness has to heal when I say Jesus (Jesus)
Every knee shall bow before
And every tongue proclaim
With worthy praise
That matchless name of Jesus

Chorus

When I call upon Your name
The very atmosphere will have to change
We'll be transformed
We'll never be the same
By the power of Your Holy name

Chorus

Jesus
Something happens when we call your name
Jesus
Oh the power in your name

Jesus Jesus Jesus
Jesus Jesus Jesus
Something happens when I call You
