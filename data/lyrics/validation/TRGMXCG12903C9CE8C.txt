This winter is rising
And you're not here
Sweetly leave
Scarlet red

So sweet so sweet!

This winter is rising
And your not here
Sweetly leave
Scarlet red

The moon is dark
And i
I can't sleep

The moon is dark
The moon is dark
And we can't sleep

These conversations kill
You put me down for the last time
These conversations kill
These conversations kill
And you had me at point blank range
Sqaure between the eyes
You let me go your feelings change..
But i can't help mine...
I can't help mine

Im having to let go
Im having to let go
Im having to let go
Im having to let go

This winter is rising
And you're not here
This winter is rising
And you're not here...

So just leave..
Lets just leave..
Don't pull us out
Don't pull us out

These conversations kill
You put me down for the last time
These conversations kill
These conversations kill
And you had me at point blank range
Sqaure between the eyes
You let me go your feelings change..
But i can't help mine...
I can't help mine

It just hurts my pride to say
You're alive...

Im having to let go
Im having to let go
Im having to let go
Im having to let go

And i was sweetly...
Rejected...
Ohh i sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell thru your hands...
And i was sweetly...
Rejected...
Ohh i sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell thru your hands...
And i was sweetly...
Rejected...
Ohh i sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell thru your hands...
And i was sweetly...
Rejected...
Ohh i sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell thru your hands...

And theres a melody
That i long to hear..
And that a melody
..that goes like this
..like this
