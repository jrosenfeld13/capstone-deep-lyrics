Trust me or deliver me
You know I'm on the run
Face to face we sit here now
This isn't all the fun
Take your eyes away from me
You know I'm apathetic
Put me wise on desperation
Take the blame from me

Sometimes I don't believe in my victory
Over tyranny, oh no
And now I'm leaving

Gimme commandos
You are immortal
I am the one who's on hire
Too many reasons
Thousand reasons for demanding termination soon
Burning desire, burning like fire
Towing me out of disaster
But this is the realm of tormenters

Sometimes I don't believe in my victory
Over tyranny, oh no
And now I'm leaving

Run away
Release the body

Sometimes I don't believe in my victory
Over tyranny
On the run
