Verse 1:
It all started off hanging out
Doing what lovers do, well on their way to falling in love
Everybody said leave you alone, girl he's no good for you
But they can't judge what they don't know

Hook:
Cause when Im with you your all I see
And when you touch me my body goes weak
Your such a part of my identity
That without you there's no me (Nooooo)

Chorus:
What were my dreams are now reality
You say all the thing's that I'm about to speak
No one could ever change the way I feel
Baby it's you and me against the world
It's ride or die til the very end
Til the tire's pop, I'll be your second skin
Your my man no doubt that I'm your girl
Baby it's you and me against the world

Verse 2:
They can hate on us if they choose
No matter what they do, it's gonna be me and you forever
The way you love me is unnatural
Like I'm the only girl who is existing in your world

Hook:
I can't picture my life without you
You been by my side the whole way through
They chance's I'll find somebody almost like you
Is a million to one, so this battle is won

Chorus:
What were my dreams are now reality
You say all the thing's that I'm about to speak
No one could ever change the way I feel
Baby it's you and me against the world
It's ride or die til the very end
Til the tire's pop, I'll be your second skin
Your my man no doubt that I'm your girl
Baby it's you and me against the world
