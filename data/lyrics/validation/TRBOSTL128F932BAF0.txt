A corrosion of mental capabilities
Trip wires fused to destroy glass cities
Come to know the coldness of the sun
Chopping down
Lesson
Tragedies forms at human rebirth
Processing under parasites worth
Learn before the comprehension is made
Breathing human toxins within this grave
I defy you to defy myself
Stand against the winds of your mankind

You're forcing me to end it
I can't stand any longer
Broken ash can't push through
This

This is the pity gone slow
Before we caress the end
We must break this law
Preparing for
Arrival

Our fate

Learn before the comprehension is made
Breathing human toxins within this grave
Stand against
Stand againt the winds of this final blow to caressing
Bleeding the saddest lies of mankind

By the hands of the righteous
We prepare for the rebirth
So we can rebuild the
Central nervous system
By the ends of the righteous
We prepare for the rebirth
So we can rebuild the
Central nervous system
This is not our existence
We are doomed to exctinction
Defy the cities saviour
Before
Life...
