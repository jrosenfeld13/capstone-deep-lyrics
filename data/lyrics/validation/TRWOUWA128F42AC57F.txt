[Ginuwine talking]
You know what baby
I'm so glad you're mine and I'm yours
I thank God for you and you just make me better
You're my better half

Who loves me like you do?
Oh baby baby
Who loves me like you do?

There just ain't another way for me to say
How much I thank the Lord for you
You know I woulda never seen the light of day
Without your strength to guide me through

You are my homie, my best friend, my lover, my dime
To show you what I feel and let you know it's real
There's no mountain i won't climb

[Chorus]
It hurts me, just to know you're hurting
And it kills me, just to know you're sad
You're all I need, you're more than just a friend to me
You're everything, cause you're my better half

There just ain't a thing that I won't do for you
You are my life, my inner soul
Without you here I lose my life and all it is
Without your love I lose control
How can I explain, words just can't describe
Gotta tell you though, I can't think about my pride
You were meant for me, you are a gift from God
You're the seed of my soul, you're the young when I'm old

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody else gon' love me like you love me
And I'm sure of it cause you're my better half
Ain't nobody else gon' treat me like you treat me
And I'm sure of it cause you're my better half

You put up with the hard times
You put up with the sad times
And your proving you love me
Girl I love you, this is all true
You're the best girl, do you hear me
And I'm ready for change girl

[Chorus, Repeat to fade]
