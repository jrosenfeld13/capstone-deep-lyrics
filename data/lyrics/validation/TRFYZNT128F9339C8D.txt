Incredible, the way the mind double works
Anything short of murder shouldn't dictate how you feel
But
Guilt is how I'm built
And it's no way to be
Relax, relax, the two words I like the least
Either way I'm fading, I'll never be at peace
'Cause
Guilt is how I'm built
And it's no way to be
I'd be better off if when I lie in bed, I said "I'm untroubled" instead
But
Guilt is how I'm built
And it's no way to be
