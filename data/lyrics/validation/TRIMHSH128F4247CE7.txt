Freedom come, freedom go
Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, freedom stay
Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Daddy is a doctor, mother is a debutante
Pillars of society, living in a mansion
Somewhere in the country
And another in Chelsea
Freedom is a rich girl, daddies little sweet girl
Pretty as a sunny day
Freedom never does do what she doesn't want
To freedom never has to pay, freedom come
Freedom is her name and freedom is her nature
Running all around the town, ev'rybody wants to
And ev'rybody tries to but nobody can hold her down
Freedom is so kind and freedom is so gentle
Freedom is a happy day
Freedom, what would you do?
If I say love you, freedom, would you run away?
Freedom come
Da, da, da, da, da, da
(Freedom)
Da, da, da, da, da
(Freedom)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Moving along
Da, la, la, la, la, la
Moving right on along
Da, da, da
