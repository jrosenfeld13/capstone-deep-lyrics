{Words & Music: Hazel O'Connor}

So you're born, so you're torn
From a place that's safe and warm
I took a journey to see a world
And you're born
And you're torn

So you're pulled from pillar to post
And you're told it's best to be the one who knows the most
Yet the more I know, I know nothing
Nothing at all
Yeh, you're born

I met a man, who sung a song
And the know-it-intellects said each note was wrong
It made me happy, that's enough
So why did they give that man a rough time

Born
Torn

I have no memory for what I do
It's just a feeling, that I give to you
Yeh, the more I know, I know nothing
Nothing at all
Yeh, and you're born

I met a man who sailed to sea
Told me everything in this world is free
He said faith, mark you, is all you need
To believe is also to bleed

You're born
Yeh and you're torn
So you're born
And you're born, and you're torn
And you're born, and you're torn

So you're born, so you're torn
From a place that's safe and warm
Took a journey to see a world
So you're born
