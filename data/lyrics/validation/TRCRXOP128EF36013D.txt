Come on pretty baby
I'm leavin' tonight
Apprehension darling
Is with me tonight
Listen pretty baby
I'm leaving tonight
And after all, I'm on my way again
Come back who knows when
But you never let me go
But I will never belong to you
Listen pretty darling
I'm leaving tonight
Apprehension baby
Is with me tonight
Come on pretty baby
I'm leaving tonight
And after all, I'm on my way again
Come back who knows when
But you never let me go
But I will never belong to you
I will never belong to you
