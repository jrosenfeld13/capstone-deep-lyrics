Staring at the backside of the Hotel "Huntington Sign"
At a quarter to 7 O'clock in the A.M., it's still quiet and it's still dark
I'm on the swings in grace cathedral park

This is the last place that we sat before you left town
This is the last place that we had before you weren't around
I hope Ohio is treating you well
