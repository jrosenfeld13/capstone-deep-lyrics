I want you to come
Across the coast and sea between us
Sills filled with sun
And engines are on
I have been gone
Back at home where it's covered in snow
And I know, I know
That you're spoken for
So I could get cut
Like the heads of the deer on the wall
They didn't run
Fast enough
Now their dear old eyes never shut
They make lonely old hunters of us
Covered in dust
Dust to dust
But I can be strong
And I'll fight anybody for love
But maybe you won't?
And we'll never know
Maybe you won't
Come visit at all
