I'm insisting that you listen, try and understand
I was wrong without reason in my demands
Can you ever forgive the way I behaved
Don't worry about it, baby
I know just how this love can be saved

Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting there

I'm depending on your wisdom to reconsider
Wounded pride held me captive, but I can deliver
You don't have to talk no more
It goes without saying
Then I'm just gonna lock the door
Pretend it was a game we were playing

Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting there

I pretend I'm busy as if you didn't know
When I'm out of your arms, there's no place to go
It's a negative reaction, now it's clear to us
But from now on, but from now on
We're gonna stick to the feelings we trust

Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting

Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting there

Let's forget all our cares and climb the stairs
Let's climb the stairs

Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting
Take me up
To the top of the stairs
We'll get lost
In the darkness waiting there
