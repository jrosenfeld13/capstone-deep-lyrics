One part sad and two parts brave
One part's silent and one part says
To the stars!

One part black and two parts blue
One part wishes the best for you
One part changed and two parts fine
I'm telling you, I'm fine

To the stars, to the stars
Oh, we are lit within
By all we've been
And by all we care to be
To the stars, from the wars
Oh, we'll wake up a little this morning
A little better than we were before
We were before

One part lustre, two parts shy
Heaven's above, trouble behind
One part glory, two parts glow
Shine on, shine well, you're free to go

To the stars, to the stars
Oh, we are lit within
By all we've been
And by all we care to be
To the stars, from the wars
Oh, we'll wake up a little this morning
A little better than we were before
We were before

One part brilliant, two parts fade
Stars apart, shine the same
