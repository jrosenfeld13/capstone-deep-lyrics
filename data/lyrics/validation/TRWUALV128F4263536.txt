Don't you give me give me give me your borrowed time
Don't you give me give me give me your recycled line
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something

Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing

And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing

Don't you give me give me give me your look of concern
I don't need your meddling when you gonna learn
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'

Well I just made my perfect world-oops you're gone
Well now you know what it feels like not to belong-so long

So don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no

Don't give me your second-hand sympathy
Don't give me your nothin', just let me be
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something

Don't you give me give me give me your worried tone
You can't fool me with that crap just leave me alone
And I don't need it, I don't need nothing

Now I have a perfect world, now you're gone-oh oh oh
Don't give me your nothin', don't give me your nothin'

Don't give me give me give me that "What did I do?"
You don't have to do nothing, you're just being you
I'll tell you why, you ain't nothing

If you make your perfect world you will find
The only place that's perfect is in your mind
What's perfect for you is like a hell for me
Two perfect worlds, it just cannot possibly be-oh oh oh oh

Don't give me your nothin'
Don't give me give me give me your "I'll be there"
I don't believe how you lie, you don't care
Don't give me your shit, don't give me your nothin'

Don't give me give me give me your "I love you"
They just are words and the words ain't true
You're full of shit, your words mean nothing

ANd I just made my perfect world, now you're gone
And in my perfect world your perfect world don't belong-so long

No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
