You're young with the time to afford yourself a few fashion mistakes
You were way out of line when you told that boy of your mission
Make or break a few hearts
He's the one who keeps busy and he runs with all the bands
Little does he know they think of him a lesser man
They see a lesser man

But if you see him
Tell him I'll meet him
On the edge of town
The edge of town
When the lights go down

I got my hair cut today it would have really amused you
We're young and we can be cruel because we choose to
Lemon juice and paper cuts go like me and you
You had a bash at being my friend
It didn't suit you

But if you see him
Tell him I'll meet him
On the edge of town
The edge of town
When the lights go down
