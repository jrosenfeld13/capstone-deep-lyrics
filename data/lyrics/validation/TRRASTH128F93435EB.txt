Every kind of nervous
Screaming inside me
Boy you don't deserve this
And my weakness terrifies me
I must breathe in breathe out
Regaining my composure
Walked in the door
I feel him getting closer

Im starting he's not stopping
I stutter he's not bluffing

Feels like Im standing by
Watching me stumble
Watching me break you heart
Im stinking low, low
Im bout to let go
[reset] not worth the tumble

[reset] just let it slide
[reset] don't let me crumble
[reset] just say goodnight

On the very surface
I could take this lightly
But there's a darker purpose
And I tremble more than slightly
I much breathe in breathe out
He's causing my exposure
Who am I now?
Cause I don't even know her

Im burning its not nothing
Im turning he's not bluffing
