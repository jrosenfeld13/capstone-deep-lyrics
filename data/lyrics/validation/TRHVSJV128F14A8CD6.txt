Temptation falls in your path
No hesitation why you ask
You have another waiting at home
And yes she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

You didn't mean to meet her you cry
Oh but the sun goes down every night
She came to you when you were alone
And yes she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

I promised myself.....a long time ago
It would be difficult to let you go
If not atleast within
The touch of my fingers-
It was close to being
In heaven-
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To being in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Is to be......in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
I know I know
