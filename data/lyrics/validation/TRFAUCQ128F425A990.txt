It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up
I felt your foundation vibrate, a mountain might erupt
I've almost got you there so let me take you all the way
A taste is stimulating, keep you hot like
What, take it till you're high and low
Like how, system overload
Like who, sure you wanna rock the boat
And hit you with the real thing
What, rock you from the left to right
Like how, electro paradise
Like who, if you wanna up your line
And hit you with the real thing
Taste the infinity and mysteries surrounding you
Erotic stereo kicks in the bass and treble too
Come hold your hands above your head and let them levitate
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop like
What, take it till you're high and low
Like how, system overload
Like who, sure you wanna rock the boat
And hit you with the real thing
What, rock you from the left to right
Like how, electro paradise
Like who, if you wanna up your line
And hit you with the real thing
Need you more than enough
Ecstasy till you're insane, yeah
Find adrenaline rush
Feel the power through your veins
And hit you with the real thing
Bring it till you're high and low, system overload
I'm gonna show you how I'm rocking the boat
Rock you from the left to right, electro paradise
I'm gonna hit you with the real thing
It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up
I felt your foundation vibrate, a mountain might erupt
Come hold your hands above your head and let them levitate
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop like
What, take it till you're high and low
Like how, system overload
Like who, sure you wanna rock the boat
And hit you with the real thing
What, rock you from the left to right
Like how, electro paradise
Who, if you wanna up your line
And hit you with the real thing
Take it till you're high and low
System overload
Sure you wanna rock the boat
And hit you with the real thing
What, rock you from the left to right
Like how, electro paradise
Like who, if you wanna up your line
And hit you with the real thing
