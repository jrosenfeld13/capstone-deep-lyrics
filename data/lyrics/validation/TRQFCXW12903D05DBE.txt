It's not the way you look tonight
I see the way you hold me tight
That makes me wanna stay all night, all night

It's that feeling
That loving feeling

This kind of feeling that I've found
I only get when you're around
I feel as though I'm gonna drown in love
With you

I've gotta know what's going on inside your mind
Think I'm in love again, but I can't make up my mind

Once it seemed so grand
But now it's getting out of hand
And I'm not the kind of man I used to be
Since that feeling's gone

I've gotta know what's going on inside your mind
Think I'm in love again, but I can't make up my mind

Once it seemed so grand
But now it's getting out of hand
And I'm not the kind of man I used to be
Since that feeling's gone
That loving feeling's gone
Since that feeling's gone
That loving feeling's gone
