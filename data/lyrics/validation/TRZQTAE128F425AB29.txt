Under an ordinary conversation steeped in deep sorrow
Waiting for confidence to rise and song
'Why is it the only time the truth is said is when
The bottle empties from your head' I said
Tell me who decides
While honey walls conceal my complication
They deceive my aim it seems in finding where I
Want to be, means I'll lose some game
Well I'll talk to you but..

When you talk to me can you so it truthfully
Either other people have or everyone I know must
Be Hollow

With another who squeezes and brother using Jesus
To tell me where I've gone wrong, born is the need for
Something greater than the need that carries on and on
Gone are the ways of guilt and holding shadows that
Were built  they fall down as I talk to you but

When you talk to me can you so it truthfully
Either other people have or everyone I know must
Be Hollow

What do I own in this life where is my home
Tell me something new and I'll talk to you but

When you talk to me can you so it truthfully
Either other people have or everyone I know must
Be Hollow

What do I own in this life, where is my home
Tell me something new and I'll talk to you but
When you talk to me can you do it truthfully
Either other people have or everyone I know must be
Hollow  I'll talk to you but when you talk to me
Can you do it truthfully, either other people have
Or everyone I know must be Hollow  Hollow
