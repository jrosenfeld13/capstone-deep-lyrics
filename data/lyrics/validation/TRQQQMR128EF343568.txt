[Verse 1]
Listen now and let me speak
I will be the dog at your feet
Come along when you call
Be the little bird in your straw
And sing you a song
I'll be there to take the fall
Though you tread upon me
For no reason at all
But just when you think you've left me blind
Well, I'll need to
Yeah, I will keep you in the corner of my eye
The corner of my eye
I will never leave your side
Though you call me your number one zero
You never mind, I'll be your king, I'll be your pawn
I will build a pedestal and put you upon it, baby

[Chorus]
Just when you think you've left me blind
I will be creeping right up behind
Because maybe if I need to, yeah
I will keep you in the corner of my eye

[Verse 2]
Down on the street, over your night
Out of your sleep, out of your sight
If I need to, yeah, if I need to
Out of your mouth in every word
Down in your ego one thing is sure
I will keep you, I will keep you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I will be the bird in your straw
But you won't get far
I will keep you in the corner of my eye
