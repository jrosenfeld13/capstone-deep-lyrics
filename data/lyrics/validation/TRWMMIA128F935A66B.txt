[Verse 1]
Just because it's not accepted doesn't mean it ain't all right
Just another frozen kid who's tryin' to make it through tonight
Ordinary pens and notebooks ain't no ordinary life
All the freaked out measures I took tryin' to make you sick of smilin'

[Chorus]
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
It's got a magic marker stain on its face and it needs a shower

[Bridge]
There's something sweet waiting in the center, taste and see
There's something sweet waiting in the center, don't nobody look at me
Don't nobody look at me

[Chorus]
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
It's got a magic marker stain on its face and it needs a shower

[Bridge 2]
How many licks does it take to get, taste and see
How many licks does it take to get to the center where there's something sweet
To the center where there's something sweet

[Outro]
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
Ordinary don't mean nothin', no, how, look what's ordinary now
Look what's ordinary now
Look at ordinary now
