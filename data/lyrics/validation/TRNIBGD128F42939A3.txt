"Show me show me show me
How you do that trick
The one that makes me scream," he said
"The one that makes me laugh," he said
And threw his arms around my neck

"Show me how you do it
And I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed his face
I kissed his head
I dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make him glow

"Why are you so far away?" he said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest ocean
Existing in the water
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe his name
I opened up my eyes

I found myself alone, alone, alone
Above the raging sea
That stole the only boy I loved
And drowned him deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven
