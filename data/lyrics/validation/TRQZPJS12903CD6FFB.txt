Just sit down in the back row
If you wanna play in my game
Guess you won't have to worry
'cause all films look the same
Just put your arms around me
And I'll make you sing out of tune
Won't nobody watch you
'cause we're lovers in the same room

Oh wah
A one
Two
Three

Put your sweet lips closer to me
This is not F One two three
And this is n8t back row anymore
I can't get enough of you

Can't get enough love

Can't get enough of you

I can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of you

Sit yourself beside me now
And imagine that we're one and not two
I don't wanna shock you
But
Baby
I'm in love with you
Sit yourself beside me now
You better close your pretty eyes when I say:
Oh wah
A one
Two
Three

Oh
Just one knock on my door
Baby
And when your people ask you
At home if you enjoyed the show

Did you like Clark Gable -
Say "l think so but I don't know"
Oh
Say you saw a sweet guy

Oh
Can't remember his name -
And the way that he kissed was
Like Clark Gable the same

Oh wah
A one
Two
Three
