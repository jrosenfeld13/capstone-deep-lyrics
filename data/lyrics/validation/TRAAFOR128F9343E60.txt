[Intro]
Yeaah..
Once again..
Yes yes y'all..

[Verse 1- MC MUDD]
A lot of people say I'm wasting my time plus all of my talents
But I'm steady making joints, so their point is not valid
So unless, your in my shoes, I suggest you stay silent
Cause I'm a calm, collected cat with tendencies to get violent
But yo, That's not the way that I prefer to handle business
I've been dealing with some cats that claim to have my best interests
But if that's the case, why you hawkin' me something relentless?
Dealing with y'all could be worse then going to the dentist
And man, That's not the way it should be. Or maybe should it?
Mixed emotions got me following instincts like Cuba Gooding
And I know, Deep down what I feel is what I feel
And what I feel is real to me, its hard to keep it concealed
But I do, for the sake of arguing, I hold it inside
Mano y mano, we need to holler and, like swallow our pride
This is a ride, we plan to take on until we die
And if you with us, then stand by our side and say Jazz Addixx!

Chorus

[Verse 2- MC MUDD]

A lot of people doubt me
Speaking evil out they mouthpiece
Saying I don't spend enough time with rhymes and now I'm all about beats
See I could vouch for that, steady broke with no loot
Cause I've been shelling out for wax, but check it
In my house is stacks of vinyl, final releases, test presses and such
I get a rush, erupt like a wino or a lush
When the vinyl is in my clutch, I find it vital so I light 'em up
Like Phonte and 9th, all day and night, my people lining up
To hear the sounds of the 3 man band, 8 man crew
I hold my own, any one in my clique, yo they can too
As individuals we define rhyme and climb to the pinnacle
And be lighting my shine till you find that I'm invisible
Refine criminals, even take time to rewind syllables
I combine spirituals with sublime lyricals, divine miracles
You never find feeling through rhyme, Ill deliver you
Yo the feeling is true, I know y'all feel it too, it's Jazz Addixx!

Chorus

[Verse 3-MC MUDD]

A lot of y'all don't really understand the feeling I get
When its time to spit, and Ragz comes in with the scratch to match, its sick
We have the gift of resurrected B-Boy, classic shit
Y'all have a fit through this ridiculous shit?
I'm passionate, and naturally this has to be
Passed down through the generations, sooner come after me
But things change drastically, So we watch as gradually
It turned to a tragedy, it was sad but I felt it was something we all had to see
Personally, I was affected dramatically, and while most laughed at me, my family was backing me
Now the torch been passed me, and I accept happily
So like a dashing athlete, I use my track to speak
Half these sweet, wanna-be tough guys been rapping weak
I tell 'em all to have a seat as we conduct this masterpiece
Yo its a masterpiece (Uh-huh)
It's a masterpiece
Yo It's a masterpiece (Uh-HUh)
Yo, It's Jazz Addixx

Chorus

We gon' do little something like this, check it out y'all, we go
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah (Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah)
Check it out, We goin', Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah (Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah)
Come on, Yo Yo, We goin', Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah (Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah)
One more time y'all, we goin' Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah (Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Yeah Yeah)
Yeah Yeah, That's right y'all, Its Jazz Addixx!

[Outro-MC MUDD]
Its like this y'all and you don't stop
DJ Boom huh, In the house y'all
DJ Ragz huh, He's in the house y'all
My name is Mud y'all, I'm in the house y'all
Jazz Addixx y'all and we don't stop
Come on, And we don't stop
Uh Uh and we dont
