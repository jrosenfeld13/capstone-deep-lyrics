Gave you the benefit of the doubt
But it seems little girl it didn't work out
Gave you the love that I never recieved
But you took my love for granted
And now i'm leaving
Leaving on a midnight plane
Gonna fly away
Yes, i'm leaving
Leaving on a midnight plane
Gonna fly away from you

Gave you the best year of my life
Tried to be everything I should
But you took my love and you threw it out
And now that i'm good i'm leaving
Oh yes, i'm leaving
Leaving on that midnight plane
Gonna fly away
Yes i'm leaving
Leaving on a midnight plane
Gonna fly away from you
I'm leaving though my heart says to stay
I'm leaving going to fly away from you
I'm leaving though my heart says to stay
I'm leaving going to fly away from you

I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane

I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
I'm leaving on a midnight plane
I'm leaving on a midnight plane, babe
