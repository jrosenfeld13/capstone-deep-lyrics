You're the goddess of my daydreams
You're the diving suit to my body
You're the one I will never touch
You're the swanlike birch

Recompense me for my longing
Sugar-coat and eat me, my Venus
Cleanse my blood with your juice
Like a swanlike birch

You're the goddess of my daydreams
You're the diving suit to my body
You're the speed I lack when I'm fleeing
You're the hiding place for my torn heart
You're the one I will never touch
You're the swanlike birch
