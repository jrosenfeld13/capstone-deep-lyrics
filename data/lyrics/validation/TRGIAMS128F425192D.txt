Take your time, I'll wait
Till you tell me that you're coming home
Don't give up, we need a little faith
Just don't let me spend the night alone
Just relax a while
There's no need to apologise
'Cause I won't let you go
I won't let you go
Again
No, I won't let you go
I won't let you go
Again
And I want you to know
I want you to know
Again
I'll stay with you until the end
Take your time, I'll wait
Send a message out to reach your heart
Everytime I think we're on our way
There's a reason that breaks us apart
I'll be strong enough to go on
Till you realise
(Till you realise)
'Cause I won't let you go
I won't let you go
Again
No, I won't let you go
I won't let you go
Again
And I want you to know
I want you to know
Again
I'll stay with you until the end
