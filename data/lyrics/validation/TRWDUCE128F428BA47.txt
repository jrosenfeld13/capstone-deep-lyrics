Love isn't love hah
Until you give it away
And what you give
Is what you get
So find someone today

Lost time will never
Never be found
Oh but I know what love is
'cause now you're around
What's learned from the crib now babe
Will last to the grave
I learned that one man's loss
Is another man's gain
When I found you
Oh yes it's true
You're the one that I adore nah
Alright
And there ain't no remedy for lovin'
But only to love you more

Love isn't love hah
Until you give it away
And what you give
Is what you get
So find someone today

Decisions made by night
May be changed by the day
But my mind's made up
Because I gave my love away
They say that time may change things
But the change depends on you
I'll keep you love forever
We'll know just what to do
Because everything must have a beginning
And you started my romance
And when that music changed inside my life forever
So did the dance
I love you so

Love isn't love hah
Until you give it away
And what you give
Is what you get
So find someone today

Love isn't love hah
Until you give it away
And what you give
Is what you get
So find someone today
Find someone today
