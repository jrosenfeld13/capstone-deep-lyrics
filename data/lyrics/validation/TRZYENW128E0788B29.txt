I will make for my own sacred place
When the pets that are injured and ill
Hide themselves away
When meteors melt
And the love that Ive felt starts to slip
The maps that hold countries intact no longer exist

My father would fear
My mother would moan if it was known
My dreams try to keep me asleep
When they find me alone
All the mountains and marshes
My bodys traveled as its grown
Are the memories of fire in the arms
That are waving me home

I will make for my own sacred place
When the lips of cursed purses
Call out to me by my name
When the rodents that hold court
Beneath my floor board start to flee
I will know that its no longer safe
And Ill follow their lead
