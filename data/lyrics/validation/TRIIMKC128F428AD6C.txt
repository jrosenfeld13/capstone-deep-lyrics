Someone's dancing on the table
Someone's got an old book in the back
Some old jocks sitting round their neighbors
Exaggerating their stats again

There's Mr. D.E. in the corner
Dancing with Miss Virginia former
I didn't think I'd really have a good time
But I don't remember you looking so fine

It's been a long dark night all right
I've been running on a low love light
Maybe the longest night
Maybe it's over, over tonight, hey, yeah

Most everyone all around
Most have an interesting story
Even those who don't have much to say
Even interest me when they're just boring to him

Then there's Mr. B.M.O.C
Talking so loud to Mr. P.E
Someone said that his best days are past
But I know this first chance won't be the last

It's been a long dark night all right
I've been running on a low love light
Maybe the longest night
Maybe it's over, over tonight

Hey now Mr. D.J
Keep those good songs coming
'Cause I'm having such a good time tonight
Moving making up for so much long lost time
Not much going since the old days
One long solo ride
I came here just to live in the past
But maybe I'm seeing the future at last

It's been a long dark night all right
I've been running on a low love light
Maybe the longest night
Maybe it's over, over tonight
