Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better, 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, you left a scar
Now I see how you really are

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You hear what I say
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You know what I meant
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You hear what I say
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You know what I meant
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
You hear what I say
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
