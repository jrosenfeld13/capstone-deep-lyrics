Take me down and close my eyes
My fingertips will touch your face again
Night time's gone and morning's come
And everybody's lost without a trace
With the air so clear
And the morning like cocaine
Everybody's coming home
Everybody's lost without a trace
When will I see you again baby
When will I see you again?
Jennifer & Julia
They don't know if they want to be alone
And so they go out dancing
And a fever wakes them gently in a room
But the room is in the night
And the night is in the wind
When will I see you again, baby
When will I see you again?
