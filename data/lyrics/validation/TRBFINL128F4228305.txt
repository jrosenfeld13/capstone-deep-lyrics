I've seen suckers lose themselves in the games
They learn to play
Children love to sing, then their voices
Slowly fade away
People always take a step away
From what is true
That's why I like you around
I want you
Yeah you do you do you do you do you do you do
You make me want you

An open invitation to the dance
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in
No apology because my urge is genuine
And the mystery of opposites attract And
Here I am and I want to take a hit
Of your sent cuz it bit
So deep into my soul
I want you
Yeah you do you do you do you do you do you do you do
You make me want you
Yeah you do you do you do you do you do you do you do
You make me want you

And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough

The village churchyard is filled with
Bones weeping in the grave
The silver line of clouds shines
On people Jesus couldn't save
You want to know how deeply my soul goes
Deeper than bones
(Deeper than bones)

And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough

After we did it by the windowsill
Smoke rings drifting into the sky
Wrapped in a quilt that my momma made
A warm candle burns to fighting off the haze
And you talk real sweet and kiss me on the cheek
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep
And They'll be no regrets when the end comes
And it will surely come
You do you do you do you do you do you do you do
You make me want you
I want you
I want you
