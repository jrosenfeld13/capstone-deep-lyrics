Something in your eyes tells me that you want more
Or maybe something less
But I just won't know, standing outside looking in
Broken dreams. Memories
Maybe now's the time to go
Let's go
I'll save my last goodbye
For now I'll leave this at goodnight, tonight
I'm thinking. I'll leave this for tonight
Take a breath. Breathe it in
Here's where we move on
I'm sick of living inbetween
Broken dreams. Memories
I can think of simpler times
When our good days weren't destroyed by lies
Time to let it go. Let it go
I'll say my last goodbye
So now I'm leaving you
Goodnight tonight
I'm leaving. I'm letting go
Die with tonight
Some thing of the past
Let go
