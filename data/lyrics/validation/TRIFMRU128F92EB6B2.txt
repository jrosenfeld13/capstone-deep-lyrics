You're seeking for the memory
Of when I took your hand
It seems you always knew me
Long before you could understand

Whatever you try to remember
You feel I was on your side
And this will last forever
No matter what you decide

Each step you make
I'm in your track
No path you'll take
Will be coming back
I will never let go off your hand
Would it last a second
Each step you make
I'm in your track
No path you'll take
Will be coming back
Even when you understand
I will walk with you to the last second

When you close your eyes
At the end of the day
You know it's no lies
That I'm here to say
When you close your eyes
The clock is ticking for you
You know it's no lies
This is how I am true
