My abhoreence toward those people that I see around
The way they act, the way they think, make me feel
Down
I hate these kind of people, they can rot in hell
Somehow, someway, I think they should be killed

These people get on my fuckin' nerves
They deserve to die
All they do is get in my fuckin' way
Then to them I love to say and pray

I hope you die in a hotel fire
I hope you die in a hotel fire
I hope you die in a hotel fire
I hope you die in a hotel fire

Cynical attitudes from boastful people
I hope you in a hotel fire
