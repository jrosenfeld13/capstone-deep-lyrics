Give me Mother Mary's baby
And cocaine white..
A re-arranged kiss, with a virgin bride
Oil from the Earth
And Dollars from the sky
I married a song who won't come home, and now I know why

I use you like a tourniquet, well just remember you asked for this
Well just remember you asked for this...

A President's mouth
And maybe his wife
A key to a city
And I'll show her a good time, here

I use you like a tourniquet, just remember you asked for this

True, (True!)
Look what i did to you
It's too good to be True, (True!)
Still not as bad as what you've done to you...

Give me your deaf and your blind
For the ones that I made numb
I'll dance around to the sound of your gun, starin' into the sun
Look at what I did to me, and look at what you've done to you
We'll get better as the days swallow themselves
Cause this is all we know how to do....

How I'd kill to be clean
And christened in the Holy Mud
I'm a sinner in the hands... I'm a sinner in the hands
Of a God that could use a good laugh, ha, ha, hah...
