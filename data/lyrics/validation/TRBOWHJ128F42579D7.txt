Exiting arm
The pit and alabaster ascension
(x2)

To cut out the middle mind and dine
Dine hard
To dine on the nectar hard
To dine on royal oil of arm

And resign the simple engine of your fears to time
And resign your slight regime to time
A you immune
To the gross and grow cold of what you know prose
What your know won't sow

Exiting arm
The pit and alabaster ascension ; When last we left Hour Hero Yes
Left one part endless, two parts death
(x2)

It's tall fright and all light
To a soft right angle of good man
It's tall fright and all light
To a soft right angle of good man
(Cut in after first line of repeated "Away" ended with "To go off black")

And from one keep to another
You left with what you there's left
Honest, in a skin-thin armor
And the wild of guess
Blood swapped with seems breath breath
(Not ghost not dead not)
To separate yourself from your effects
And to evacuate one's sturdy flesh

Would you skin your skull to draw its strength?
Oh no you're way to goner for that
Would you swallow a lie to disinfect your angst?
Oh no you're way to goner for that
Would you razorblade redecorate your arm?
Oh no you're way to goner for that
Would you freeze a lake shut just to steal you calm
Oh no you're way too far gone

Exiting arm
The pit and alabaster ascension

Exiting arm
