I feel the tug of war
I fight the fight
But I don't have the patience
Or the stamina to last one night
With color mad candy mouth you

Your reputation lives
In spite of me
Your platitudes and berzerk theories
Super real fantasy
That infuriating
Vanishing twin

He has metal bones and a wild eyed stare
I'm thinking feigning interest
Badly like a liar
And then he blows me away

And then all I want is
A room and you
The urban hillside glinting copper
In the morning
A broken spell
Alive and well

That's the way the cookie bounces
In spite of me
I hate clever sons of bitches
Who can't leave a girl alone
To rot in peace
