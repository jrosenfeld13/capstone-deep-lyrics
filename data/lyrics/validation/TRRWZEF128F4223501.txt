My enemy is sleeping inside my dreams
And I can't leave,whats inside of me
Going back again,to my neighborhood
Where I was king,and life was good
How things change

Forgot to thank you
For all the great memories
Forgot to tell you how much it did for me

I blame myself ,for everything
Lying and crying dont take back
The words I said
Controlling, demanding, I'm surprised you
Stayed this long
The sheep leaves the flock, I lost another
Friend

It was fun but I think I've grown out of you
Selfish boy there's no room for two

Another friend,Another friend I push away
Another friend
The cycle, keeps me, from having to many regrets

Stop it, you better stop it
I wanna turn you, I wanna turn you to me
