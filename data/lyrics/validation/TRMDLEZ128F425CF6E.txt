(I just love it when you come to me)
(And you want me)
(And its all I expected)

Here we are, alone in a room
Only dressed by a shadow, me and you
My lips are dry, better kiss me quick
Just put some pressure on it

Thats it, right there
Thats it, right there
Thats it, right there
Thats it, right there

Tangled tongues dancing around
Your hands on my skin, going down
You got me weak in the knees, I cannot control this
You got me tamed, not many men can do this

You know my body like nobody
Never felt so naughty, oh boy you got it
We dont need no bed, at least not yet
It feels so good when its unexpected

Light as a feather, your fingertips
Searching my body
You got me weak in the knees, I cannot control this
You got me tamed, not many men can do this

You know my body like nobody
Never felt so naughty, oh boy you got it
We dont need no bed, at least not yet
It feels so good when its unexpected

I feel so good (so good, so good, so good)
I feel so good (I feel so good)

You know my body like nobody
Never felt so naughty, oh boy you got it
We dont need no bed, at least not yet
It feels so good when its unexpected

You know my body (your touch) like nobody (your lips)
Never felt so naughty, oh boy you got it (your featherlight fingertips)
We dont need no bed, at least not yet
It feels so good when its unexpected (and it feels so good)

So good (Thats it, right there)
Thats it, right there
Thats it, right there
Thats it, right there
Thats it
