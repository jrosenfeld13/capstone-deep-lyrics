[Hook]
I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)

She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news
Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you

When you act crazy it be making me postal
Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you

[Verse 1]

First she love me, then she don't, then she love me
First she wanted a hug, now she wanna club me
First thing I said was, hey baby you looking lovely
You shrug your shoulders and tell me you feeling ugly
Give another compliment then you mean mug me
I even dressed up rocking the clean rugby
Baby, I'm just a man doing what I can
It should mean something, I'm seeing you and none of them
You know I'm the shit, so you don't fool with other men
And I'd still be with you even if you were not a ten
You getting one of the moods, and threw me out again
And the way that you talking its like you truly not a friend
My lifestyle is making you doubt what I'm about
I've been through this before it ain't hard to figure out
And when I'm on the verge of leaving
You get to thinking
The next thing you know we laying in the bed sleeping
She like you so loco
When you go postal
Yeah you like that, you like that, don't you

[Hook]

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)

She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

[Verse 2]

Using sex as a weapon should never be part of the plan
Jealous the introspection probably help you with that
But in fact
You'd rather be on the attack
Yelling and screaming in public, girl you know the math
It never adds up
All it does is just subtract
Until you hit that brick wall and there ain't no coming back
Get up
Telling me first
Man she was so thirsty
But now as I was giving she was hallowing mercy
But now she ultra confrontational in the worst way
Fucking up my summertime and crashing my birthday
With a hurricane, I heard saying the same old thing
I'm always in the eye of the storm
You know the game
Is played out
I stay out
And drankst out so I don't think about it
Cause she make me feel like America's most hounded
You think I wanna stick around in mushroom cloud shit
A nuclear fallout when she pop up and shouted
And I was just defending myself
You know how I do
And even when I blew my lid, I kept it so true

[Hook]

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)

She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

[Verse 3]

Dam, You got some nerve miss
I'm thinking to myself, do I deserve this
I mean, I'm trying to be there with you
But honestly, I'm lightweight scared of you
I just can't see myself without you
Same time, I can't be myself around you
Understand I'm a work in progress
All this fussing will just hurt the process
Still I feel like you complete me
I'm such a weakling man look how you treat me
I know that love ain't suppose to hurt
Even brought you around my seed you got close to her
Turn around and use that against me
When you flash you do it with such intensity
Say anything to offend me
I ain't gonna tell you what my family and friends think
Skip it baby, Cause this is our thing
Why you gotta make loving me such a hard thing

[Hook]

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)

She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

When you act crazy it be making me postal

(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)
