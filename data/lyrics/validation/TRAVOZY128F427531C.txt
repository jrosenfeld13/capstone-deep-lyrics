You're my champagne
My only side mondaine
You make me sane
When I'm one step away from really hurting myself

You are my tower
Girl, you can golden shower
All over me
'Cause I'm one inch away from destroying myself

I only wish that you've got plans for me baby
You know I'll be good and you can stick everything in me
The reason I jump from my seat is not you
I'm just very alert, don't want to carcrash with you
