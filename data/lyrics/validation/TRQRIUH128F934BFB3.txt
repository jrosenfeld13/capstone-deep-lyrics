There's an easy evening breeze
Moving softly through the trees
I feel my head begin to reel
Can't explain the way I feel
Now the moonlight is falling around her
Don't you know that
Tonight is the night for surrender
Can't you see it coming down
She's holding you spellbound, spellbound

She's got me hanging by a heartbeat
Burning in the evening heat
She takes me there and leaves breathless
Starry eyed, satisfied
When you're burning the bridges behind you
Don't you know that
Smoke can begin to blind you
Can't you see it coming down
It's holding you spellbound, spellbound

Now the moonlight is falling around her
Don't you know that
Tonight is the night for surrender
Can't you see it coming down

She's holding you spellbound, spellbound

She's holding on to me
She's holding on it's true
She's holding on, she won't let go
Spellbound
And she won't let go
Spellbound
