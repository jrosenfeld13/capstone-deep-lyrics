Well I just came in this bar for a beer
I didn't know that country band was playin here
'Cause I'm in love with a steel player's wife
And I know it's not right and I want her tonight
And that's how it is in cowboy peyton place

Well I met her in soul creek just by chance
She asked me if I wanted to dance
She said I love you recklessly, you turn me on
I love this steel playing band
And it's part of the plan
And we mess around in cowboy peyton place

Well it seems like a plot out of a movie
Maybe pages of a Hollywood magazine
Well they say the way were living might not be right dear
But you know I think my dear we're never down

(Instrumental break)

Well I met her in soul creek just by chance
She asked me if I wanted to dance
She said I love you recklessly, you turn me on
I love this steel playing band
And it's part of the plan
And we mess around in cowboy peyton place

Yes it has its up and downs in our town now
When you stare it in the face
And your part of the race
In that losing boozing cowboy peyton place

When you stare it in the face
And your part of the race
In that losing boozing cowboy peyton place
