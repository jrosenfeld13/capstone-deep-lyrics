If only I could open up my heart
You would be the first to enter
Together we could reach for another day
Seek possibilities
The next thing then we'll have to do
Is to get out
Out of reach and out of center
So no one in the world can disturb the feeling
Of being you and me
It's all here in my heart
It's all here in my dreams
All here in my heart
I could show you what you got
I could show you what you need
It's all here in my, all here in my heart
I've had to take some time all to myself
To restore and to re-enter
Been trying to break out
But I am still too scared
Of being hurt again
My friends keep telling me I must try to let go
But who are they to tell me to do such a thing
When you know that all I want
Is to have him here with me
It's all here in my heart
And it's everything I got
You know, it's all here in my heart
It's all here in my dreams
All here in my heart
You could show me what I got
You could show me what I need
It's all here in my heart
Oh, you know
It's all here in my heart
I could show you what you got
I could show you what you need
It's all here in my, all here in my heart
All here in my heart
