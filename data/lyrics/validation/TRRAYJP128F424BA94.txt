(Can't turn me loose
(Can't turn me loose)
(Can't turn me loose)
(Can't turn me loose)

Oh no I can't turn you loose
If I do I'm gonna lose my pride
No no, I can't turn you loose
If I do I'm gonna lose my mind
No I can't turn you loose till my days are up
I love you baby, yes I do
Ooooh baby, hip-shakin' mama
I told your mum my love's for you
I warn you baby, do it baby
But don't you baby, gonna give you what you want
(Can't turn me loose)
(Can't turn me loose)
(Can't turn me loose)
(Can't turn me loose)

Oh no I can't turn you loose
If I do I'm gonna lose my pride
I can never turn you loose
If I do I'm gonna lose my mind
No, I can't turn you loose till my days are up
Well, 'cos I love you baby, yes I do
'Cos you're a hip-shakin' mama
I told your mummy, my love's for you
I want you baby, don't do it, don't do it baby
I'll give you everything that you wantin'
(Can't turn me loose) No,no,no,no don't turn me loose
(Can't turn me loose) Do-on't turn me loose
(Can't turn me loose) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no don't
