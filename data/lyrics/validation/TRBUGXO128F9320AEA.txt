[Verse 1: Jan Howard]
I had the key to heaven when we married
And for a while I brought you happiness
But now your love for me is dead and buried
And every night you share another's kiss

[Chorus: Jan Howard]
And I'd rather be the one you slip around with
Than be the one whose dream of love is gone
Yes I'd rather be the one you spend your time with
Than be the one at home all alone

[Verse 2: Jan Howard]
Deep down inside I know that I should leave you
How many tears must fall before I learn
I think of many ways that I could grieve you
And yet I'm always here when you return

[Chorus: Jan Howard]
But I'd rather be the one you slip around with
Than be the one whose dream of love is gone
Yes I'd rather be the one you spend your time with
Than be the one at home all alone
