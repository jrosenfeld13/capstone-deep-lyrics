Show me a writer
With a sad, sad song
Who lived his pain
Just stayed to long

Show me a fighter
Fighting for his king
His heart and blood
Left in the ring

Give me a needle
I can pass on through
I'll take that chance, girl
How about you?

Show me the lover
Who when all seems lost
Makes love to his grief
Careless of the cost

Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on

Show me a father
With a broken son
His face like stone
Cold as a gun

There was a soldier
Atop my crumbling walls
But wind and rain just
Drowned his calls

I know it's hard
Not so hard to tell
That my head don't
Match my water well

Like walking listless
Down a darkened street
I hear the drum
I just can't keep the beat...

Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on

Been a while since
I was on trial
For the course
My life has run

I haven't heard any words
That that forgive the things I've done

So set a course for the north
I'll be waiting for word to come
Just come away
Come away
Come away
Come away
Way
Come away, my son

Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
