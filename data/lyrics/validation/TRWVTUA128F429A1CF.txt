Well, alright, here it is
H-Blockx alongside Dr. Ring-Ding
Burning ring, fire burn
Yee-hah

(incomprehensible)

Love is a burnin' thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by the wild desire
Hell I fell into a ring of fire

Tell them all about the ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down down down
The flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

Ring of fire, then

Sing again

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I felt for you like a child
Oh, oh my heart went wild

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down down down
The flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

Well, alright
Fire burn, fire burn
Listen to me, now

In them fire, fire, love is a splendid thing
Listen Ring-Ding don't know about the loving
Make a blind man see (incomprehensible)
(incomprehensible)

(incomprehensible)

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down down down
The flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

Sing it again

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down down down
The flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

Ring of fire burn like a scotch (incomprehensible)
