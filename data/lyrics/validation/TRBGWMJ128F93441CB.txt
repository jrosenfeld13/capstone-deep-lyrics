[Verse 1]
I have become increasingly
Overwhelmed but not discouraged
And soon Ill leave the infirmary
Feeling well
But lacking courage
Courage
And now the rockets fly above
Passing over
Cape Canaveral
Theres the woman with the drugs
In the caf
By the launch pad
By the launch pad

[Chorus]
And she is gonna
Ring me up
On my Cellular Phone
So I know Im not alone
In a world full of vampires
Come on darling
Talk me down
On that Cellular Phone
Because I cant get home
Im a slave to the wires
Ive done this before
I will do it more

[Verse 2]
I have become increasingly
Overwhelmed when
Im in public
Im not so patient when they stare
Theres a fighter
Somewhere underneath this skin and bones
And do you know what I mean?
What I mean when I say that this girl
Has got a thing for my machine

[Chorus]
And she is gonna
Ring me up
On my Cellular Phone
So I know Im not a lone
In a world full of Vampires
Come on darling
Talk me down
On that cellular phone
Because I cant get home
Im a slave to the wires
Ive done this before
Ive done this before

[Bridge]
But I have given everything and more
Sometimes convinced I have the world to carry
Every day is war
And rockets fly from dusk til dawn
I wont be shaken
If ever theres a time
Where I am gone just know Im waiting
For you to ring
For you to ring...


Me up on my Cellular Phone
So I know Im not alone
In a world full of vampires
Come on darling
Talk me down
On that Cellular Phone
Because I cant get home
