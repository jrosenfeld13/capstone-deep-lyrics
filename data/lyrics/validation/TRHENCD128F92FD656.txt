Take me to your leader turn the lights out
Close the doors and lock the room
I require a meeting with the girl
Who took my soul this afternoon
Don't go telling me she's not here now
I followed her home alone Lenina

Hey hey Lenina aliens are pulling your strings
I've got my eyes on you Lenina
I only wanna tell you one thing

Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday Sunday where were you
Same old fur-trimmed janitor keeps me
Outside in the snow the whole week through
Don't go telling me lies about her
I got my own spies Lenina

Hey hey Lenina aliens are pulling your strings
I've got my eyes on you Lenina
I only wanna tell you one thing

I've been trying to keep it quiet
But the secrets getting out
And everyone seems to know
They got their spies in the sky
And a line from MI5

And a pocketful of files
With the finger on you

Saw you at the window, Alice on a toadstool
Breathing little clouds with a smile
As you traced your name
Me with a good view, Johnny on a corkscrew
Cassacks at the door with a smile
Say you can't come in
Intelligence says you're out of reach there
Defectors smile from every corner
Love like danger man

Hey hey Lenina aliens are pulling your strings
I've got my eyes on you Lenina
I only wanna tell you one thing

Lenina Karenina I'll tell you one thing
I'll try morse love and semaphore
You'll maybe lip read
I'll leave a message on the radio
To tell you where to come and find me
I've got a box of black magic for you
