Savior
Save me from this hell I'm in
Take me
Lead me out and take me in
Make me
Help me try to understand
Hate me
Just because of who I am

Judge you by the clothes you wear
Judge you by the length of hair
Find out not who you are
Take you just for what you are

Shame me
With a name that is not mine
Blame me
With everthing that comes with time
Call me
Anything you would like
Taunt me
I can take it all that's right

Judge you by your shade of skin
Judge you by the clique your in
Talk to me see in my mind
Taken back by what you'll find

Don't judge me
Don't
Don't judge me
Don't

Savior
Save me from the hell I'm in

Judge you by the clothes you wear
Judge you by the length of hair
Find out not who you are
Take you just for what you are

Don't judge me
Don't
Don't judge me
Don't
