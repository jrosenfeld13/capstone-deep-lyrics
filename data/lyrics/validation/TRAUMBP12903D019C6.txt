Warriors in the rain soaked jungle
Fighters for an unknown cause
Death reflecting every victim
My life is lost in the reapers jaws

Daybreak brings more of the terror
Napalm clears a path miles long
My nostrils fill with scents of incineration
The enemy lies in heaps, hundreds strong

Battle zones
You're in my battle zones
Battle zones
Battle zones

Rapid fire machines guns blaring
Flames destroy cities by the score
I must escape this evil vision
Get my orders from the overlord

I see the final day is coming
I feel it way down deep into my bones
This nightmare is finally over
Is it time for this man to come home?
I'm coming home

Battle zones
You're in my battle zones
Battle zones
Battle zones
