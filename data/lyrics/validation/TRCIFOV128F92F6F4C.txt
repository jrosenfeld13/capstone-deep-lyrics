Wanna tell you a story
About the house rent blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said that don't befront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady
I said, "You let me slide?"
I'll have the rent for you tomorrow
Or the next day I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people
I notice when I come home in the evenin'
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey
I come home one particular evenin'
The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?"
I said, "No, can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent"
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post"
I said "But I'm tired, I been walkin' all day"
She said "That don't befront me
Long as I get my money next Friday"
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent
And out the door I went

So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said "Look man, I'm outdoors, you know
Can I stay wicha maybe a couple days?"
He said "Uh, let me go and ask my wife"
He come out of the house
I could see in his face
I knowed it was "no"
He said "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, an' all"
I said "I know, everybody funny, now you funny too"
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent
She said "Yeah?" I said "Aw yeah"
And then she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey
So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go
I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go
She a-hollerin' about the front rent, she be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar, you know, people
I go to the bar, I rent my coke, I call the bartender
I said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
Said, "Whatchoo want?"

"One bourbon, one scotch, one beer"
Well I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when
I been drinking bourbon whiskey, scotch and gin
Gonna get high man, I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple shot o' that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

But I'm sittin' there at the bar
I'm gettin' drunk, I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar, here come the bartender
I said "Look man, come down here"
Said "Whatchoo want?"

"One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since the night before last
Gotta get a drink man, I'm gonna get gassed
Gonna get high man, I ain't had enough
Need me a triple shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk, won'tcha listen right here
I want one bourbon, one shot 'n' one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer" (well all right)

(Yeah)
(Scratch my back, bay-bah)
(Yeah-ahhh right)

Now by this time I'm plenty high
You know when your mouth a-getting dry, you're plenty high
Looked down the bar, I see'da my bartender
I said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
He said "Whatchoo want this time?
I said "Look man, a-what time is it?"
He said "The clock on the wall say three o'clock
Last call for alcohol, so what you need?"

"One bourbon, one scotch, one beer"
Lord, I ain't seen my baby since a-nigh on a week
Gotta get drunk man, so I can't even speak
Gonna get high man, listen to me
One drink ain't enough Jack, you better make it three
Gonna get drunk, I'm gonna make it real clear
I want one bourbon, one scotch 'n' one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer"
