Happy talkin', talkin Happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You've got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true

Talk about the moon floating in the sky
Looking like a lily on a lake
Talk about the bird learning how to fly
Making all the music he can make

Happy talkin' talkin Happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You've got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true

Let's talk about the star looking like a toy
Peeking through the branches of a tree
Talk about the girl talk about the boy
Counting all the ripples on the sea

Happy talkin' talkin Happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You've got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna make a dream come true

Talk about the boy saying to the girl
Golly baby I'm a lucky cus
Talk about the girl saying to the boy
You and me are lucky to be us

Happy talkin' talkin Happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You've got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna make a dream come true
And if you don't talk happy
And you never have a dream
Then you'll never have a dream come true
