Well, I went up on the mountain and I looked down on my life
I have squandered all my money and lost my faithful wife
My heart was full with sorrow and I almost took my life
But I found the strength inside me to give life one more try

If at first you don't succeed
Try, try, again
If at first you don't succeed
Just try and try again

If all you do is lose
You better find a way to win
If at first you don't succeed
Try and try again

I know someday the world will learn to sing a better song
The blind will see, the deaf will hear we'll all just sing along
The fighting will be ended and all hunger will all be gone
It's everybody's business 'til we get the good work done

If at first you don't succeed
Try, try, again
If at first you don't succeed
Just try and try again

If all you do is lose
You better find a way to win
If at first you don't succeed
Try and try again
