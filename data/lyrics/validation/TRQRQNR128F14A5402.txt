She acts sorta teenage, just in-between age
Looks about four foot three
Although she's just small fry, just about so-high
Gidget is the one for me

A regular tomboy but dressed for a prom
Boy, how cute can one girl be?
Although she's not king size, her finger is ring-size
Gidget is the one for me

If she says she loves you
You can bet your boots she loves you
If she says she hates you
That can also mean she loves you

It very well may be she's just a baby speaking romantically
If that's a bad feature, I'll be the teacher
Gidget is the one for me

She's not much on glamour
And she should improve her grammar
Still I sigh and stammer
And my heart beats like a little ole hammer

Strictly from Dixie, face like a pixie
Shorter than girls should be
The rest of the shipment standard equipment
Just a doll in dungarees
But Gidget is the one for me
