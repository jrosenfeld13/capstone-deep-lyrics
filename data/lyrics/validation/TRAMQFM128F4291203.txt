You walked away so easily
You washed your hands of it all
Didn't even notice, babe
That I followed you in
Arriving here again
On and on, these drifting days
Are killing me inside
You didn't even notice, babe
'Cause your heart is so damn small
Blood is turning cold
Please, you better send some love
Please, you better send it fast
Right away
You better

Nothing is getting clear at all
Feel it close
Show me how to live right, baby
How to live, baby
I finally found the one I want
But your heart is so damn small
And your blood is turning cold
Please, you better send, you better send some love
Please, you better send it fast
Right away
Right away

I've the right to know
Anything about you, girl
I got to have you to

Please, you better send, you better send some love, babe
Please, you better send it fast
Baby, you better send some love
You better send it fast
Right away
Right away
