[Verse 1]
You don't care for me at all
I found you only stay
To make me feel so very small

No you don't love me now
I'm gonna feel someday, somehow
And it's gonna be too late

[Verse 2]
Darling, there you go again
Hurting me in front of all my wonderful friends
I've been good to you
You better treat me like you used to do

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna be too late

[Chorus]
And I see you run, run, run
Run on, baby
And I see you cry, cry, cry
Cry on, baby

[Post-Chorus]
But it's too late, bye bye

[Verse 3]
No, you don't care
You don't care at all
I said you couldn't care at all
