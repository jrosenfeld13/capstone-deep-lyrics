[Verse 1]
This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

[Verse 2]
This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

[Verse 3]
This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all, to sing my songs for you
Ooh, I love to sing my songs for you
Yes I do, Lord, I love to sing my songs for you
