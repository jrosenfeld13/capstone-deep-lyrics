[Verse 1]
Sure you haven't got the wrong number
You sure its me you want to talk to tonight?
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right

[Chorus]
Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be running out of fools

[Verse 2]
When you went and left me there crying
Your goodbye was even colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
And now you want to break my heart twice

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Guess you got back (guess you got)
To my name
In your little black book

[Verse 3]
Well, listen
Tell you what (tell you what)
Bet you forgot (you forgot)
How I even look
So go ahead with all your sweet talking
Go ahead for all the good it can do
Have yourself a dime's worth of talking
And then I'm going to hang right up on you

[Bridge]
Because this time, you're not
You're not getting through to me
I guess you must be running out of fools

[Outro]
Even fools like me
Even fools like me
I said you're running out of fools
Even old fools like me
