I have found, most of you spend your days walking around
With your head in a cloud
No idea what you're talking about
Wasting words thinking out loud
I have finally got you figured out
As you scream and shout

Don't patronize me
There's more to this then you see
I am what you can never be
And that is free

Free from all of this
The scramble, the struggle, the fear of turning out a mess
Let go of expectations, go the distance
Enjoy this hellride, opinions don't define existence

Don't patronize me
There's more to this then you see
I am what you can never be
And that is free

Try to prove to me with evidence
That I should expect nothing but a constant stream of stress
Life's a bitch, I know, get over it
Find your joy and love the experience

As you scream and shout
I realize that you are not profound
You don't have the right to take me down

Don't patronize me
There's more to this then you see
I am what you can never be
And that is free

Sick and tired of all of you
Sucking the fun out of my life
