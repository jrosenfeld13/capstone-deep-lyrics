There's no good way of seeing it
It's all joke and lies and smiling under the sun
It wouldn't be a dream if I could ever really land it
Like it so much, there's no reason why

I can't talk and I can't do anything
God save us the man aims to please
Just do it, it won't mean anything
Got a wild track working nine degrees

Psychic not tonight
Sucked in
Miami Skyline
Sunshine
The speed of the skyline
Miami Skyline
The speed of it all

There's no good way of doing it
Sucking the wind like it's a medicine ball
Look out the side, they're coming two at a time now
It comes in slow so it can tease your mind

I can't talk and I can't do anything
God save us the man aims to please
Just do it, it won't mean anything
Got a wild track working nine degrees

Psychic not tonight
Sucked in
Miami Skyline
Sunshine
The speed of the skyline
Miami Skyline
The speed of it all

Looking good
I'm doing all right
