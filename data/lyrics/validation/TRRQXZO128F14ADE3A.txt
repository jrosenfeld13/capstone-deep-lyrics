[Verse 1]
Burning bridges
Burning bridges
Shut myself off from the world
Burning bridges
Burning bridges
Shut myself off from life

[Verse 2]
As the ashes fall
As the ashes fall
Through the fire
Through the flame
As the ashes fall
As the ashes fall
Through the fire
Through the flame

[Breakdown]
Life purified again

[Chorus]
I won't look back
To the chains that bound me
I won't look back
To the chains that bound me

[Bridge]
And I will lay to rest my ghosts
And cover my footsteps
And I will stand up straight, and walk away
Leaving them far behind

[Outro]
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
Won't look back
Chains that bound me
