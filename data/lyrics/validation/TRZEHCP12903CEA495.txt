Futari no kankei
Futari no SYSTEM
Futari no keiyaku
Futari no bouryoku
Futari wa aishiatte

Sore de oshimai

Kitto futari wa yoku oniaidane
Kodomo mitai ni naka ga ii shi ne
Sousa futari wa ii COMBI mitai
Kitto futari wa

Futari wa ENNUI
Futari wa tanpaku

Futari wa tagaini kuchi mo
Kikazu tada

Soshite wakareru

Kitto futari wa yoku oniaidane
Kodomo mitai ni naka ga ii shi

Dare mo kimi no koto nado

Aite ni shinai sa
Dare ni mo aisarezu ni ikiru no wa
Tatoeba donna kibun?
Oshiete okure yo

----------------------------------------
2 people's relationship
2 people's system
2 people's contract
2 people's violence
2 people love each other hate each
Other, deceive each other
It's over

Surely 2 people are well-matched
They get along as children do
Yes, surely 2 people are like
A good combination

2 people are bored
2 people are indifferent
2 people are a problem
2 people are serious
2 people don't talk
To each other
Just hate each other
And split

Surely 2 people are well-matched
They get along like children

No one knows these
Things about you
No one takes you seriously
To live without giving love to
Someone
How does it feel?
Tell me

REFRAIN

2 people's reality
2 people's pleasure
2 people's heaven
2 people's disappointment
2 people's obscenity
2 people are typical
2 people are complete
2 people are the worst
2 people just curse each other
Betray each other
It's all over

REFRAIN

A couple so alike that I can't
Stand it

REFRAIN

Surely 2 people are only 2 people

REFRAIN
