Rub the Stone
Magic and rituals of long lost years
Which doctor shall you use to erase your fears ?
Whatever you believe is real to you
The power in your prayer creates your own voodoo
'Cause you don't want to be alone
When you feal the fear comming you better rub the stone

(Chorus)
When your looking for the way
You got to believe in something
You got to rub the stone
When there's nothing left to say
You got to believe in something
You got to rub the stone
Outcast is all he's ever been
Holy fathers doomed and branded him with sin
They taxed his sould and made it hard to survive
Only one path for Galileo so he lied
He found the truth on his own
And what he finally discovered...He had to rub the stone

(chorus)
