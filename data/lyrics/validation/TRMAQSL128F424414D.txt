I remember the way you told me:
"It's all good, I don't need your God right now
I kinda believe in the words you say
But I don't want to follow your ways"
Somehow, it all felt so good
Living so easy
But somewhere inside you
You wanted to be me
You wanted to have that spark in your eyes
But to turn from ice
You need to realize
There's more to life than just giving up
Living up, is the way you should be feeling now
Giving out all your ways to the One
Who can make you feel fine
C'mon everybody make up yor mind

This day's gonna be the last day
When I'm gonna drive the left lane
C'mon everybody it's time to realize
C'mon everybody it's time to get wise

So many days, in so many ways
This life disappointed you, always
There's gotta be more to it than this
Cause somewhere within
You felt a breeze
Of fresh air when you talk about it
So different from the times
When you shouted
Out your pain out in the rain
Kinda tired now of driving the wrong lane
Tired of not having the things you know you could
This road seems endless
A waste of youth
So now don't you think you should take the wheel
And drive this wreck home, for real
