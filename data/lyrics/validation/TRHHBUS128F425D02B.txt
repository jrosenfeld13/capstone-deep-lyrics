There was a look in your eyes when you sat me down that rainy night
And you said, "Don't worry, everything will be alright."

(The dancer's dead) Time is really running out
(She slipped and fell) Nothing I can do to help
(She snapped her neck) Feel her beating heart slow down

I wrapped you in my arms and gave a kiss goodbye
Our love will never die tonight
I whisper in your ear. "Just let go, don't be scared."
Our love will never die tonight

It was the time of the year
When the leaves fall down and the skies are clear
And I knew that this was
Gonna be our last goodbye

Feeling of your broken heart
I can sense you're giving up
I'll watch you die a thousand times

I wrapped you in my arms and gave a kiss goodbye
Our love will never die tonight
I whisper in your ear. "Just let go, don't be scared."
Our love will never die tonight

Your hands were cold and weak
Your lips so cracked and blue
Your hair so thin and frail
It's like you're dead inside

I wrapped you in my arms and gave a kiss goodbye
Our love will never die tonight
I whisper in your ear. "Just let go, don't be scared."
Our love will never die tonight
