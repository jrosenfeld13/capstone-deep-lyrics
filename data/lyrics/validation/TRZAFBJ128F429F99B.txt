Now, hand me down, hand me down
My old suitcase
An all my old dirty clothes
Now look down, look down
That long lonesome road
Where you and I, I must go

Now, which-a-way, which-a-way
That rail, railroad run?
Well, it runs from my window
To the risin' sun

Now the best, best of friends
Got to part, part sometimes
So why not you, you and I?

'Pick it! ' 'My, my, my'

(instrumental)

I followed my baby
To the station
Even helped her on a train
An tears came down
Just like midnight showers of rain

Now, where were you, where were you
When that rollin' mill burnt down?
Well, I was standin' in the country
Just one mile from town

Well, that old mill whistle, it did blow
Like it ain't gon' blow no mo'
I was just standin' here wond'in
Where did my baby go?
