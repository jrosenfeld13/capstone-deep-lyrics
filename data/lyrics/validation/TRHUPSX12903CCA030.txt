A melted soul, the endless need
I feel so tired, just want to hold you
What's the world, the world don't care, we got it here we've got forever
Letting go's the hardest part
Cos deep inside we're losing something
What's the world, the worlds a mess, there's nothing here, there's nothing left
The fear takes hold, forget it all
Just ripples in the glass of time, nowhere to run this time
