Afrika:

Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
You in my hut now, my hut
Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
You in my hut now
When you're in my hut
You know what's up
Let your mind be free
Relax your body
Jump, jump a little higher
Jump, jump until you get tired
House your body
House your body
House your body to the bass
House it all over the place
Don't let nobody in your way
Tonight's your night, today's your day
Afrika won't steer you wrong
(Say what?) House music all night long (4x)

Mike G:

I'll house you
I'll house you
I'll house you
You in my hut now (repeat 2x)

Mike G:

Girl, I see you
Do what you do
Go on, girl, and act a fool
There's no need to play it cool
Everybody, shake your body
(We got's to make this a real house party)
Come on, come on and stick with me
I'll keep things the way they should be
Keep your house until you sweat
Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
House is food and you need it
If I feed it, you should eat it
Say, "House your body, house your body" (2x)
You know, Mike G won't steer you wrong
House music all night long
(Say what?) House music all night long (2x)
House music all night long

Afrika:

I'll house you
I'll house you
I'll house you
You in my hut now (2x)

Hook: Afrika

Round and round and round and round and round and..
Hear the house music steady steady poundin
Feel the energy rush up to your face
Feel the vibe, feel the vibe, feel the bass
