[Verse 1: Martin Fry]
Once upon a time when we were friends
I gave you my heart, the story ends
No happy ever after, now were friends
Wish upon a star if that might help
The stars collide if you decide
Wish upon a star if that might help

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What's it like to have loved and to lose her touch?
What's it like to have loved and to lose that much?

[Chorus 1]
Well I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back
Remembering, surrendering
Remembering that part
All of my heart

[Verse 2]
Spilling up pink silk and coffee lace
You hook me up, I rendezvous at your place
Your lipstick and your lip gloss seals my fate
Sentimental powers might help you now
But skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers
You'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
Or that pleasure and pain, sunshine and rain
Might make this love grow

[Chorus 2]
But I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back
Remembering, surrendering
The kindest cut's the cruelest part
All of my heart

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 3]
Yes I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
And I shrug and I say that maybe today
You'll come home soon
Surrendering, remembering
Surrendering that part
All of my heart

All of my heart
