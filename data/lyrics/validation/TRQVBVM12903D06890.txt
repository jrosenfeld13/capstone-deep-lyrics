Hey you guys - sitting in high place
Spare your fake - sorry face
Here we are - closing in on pain
Here we are - all so vain
Innocent dead people bother my mind
Uneducation is breeding the crime

Can't go on - continue to ignore
What is wrong - facing war
Praise the lord - whatever he may be

Spread the word - find the key

Innocent dead people bother my mind
Uneducation is breeding the crime
Catching the warmakers perfectly right
Hang 'em on high trees for everyone's eyes

Justify the silly tug of war
Bloody hands at my door
