[Intro]
At slow speed we all seem focused
In motion we seem wrong, wrong
In summer we can taste the rain

[Chorus]
I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

[Verse 1]
Two can play this game
We both want power
In winter we can taste the pain
In our short years, we come long way
To treat it bad and throw away

[Chorus]
I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

[Bridge]
You won't cry, I won't scream

[Verse 2]
In our short years we come long way
To treat it bad and throw away
And if we make a little space
A science fiction showcase
In our short film, a love disgrace
Dream a scene to brighten face
In our short years we come long way
To treat it bad, just to throw it away

[Chorus]
I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

[Bridge]
You won't cry, I won't scream
