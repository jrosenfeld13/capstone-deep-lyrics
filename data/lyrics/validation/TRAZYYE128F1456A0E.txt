Why did I listen to my friends
When they told me what to do
Yes, I still have my friends
But I don't have you
And like true friends, they still come around
And say, "I'm sorry you're blue"
Oh, everybody loves me but you

My friends don't know what they've done
Wwell, they wouldn't understand anyhow
I can't tell them they were wrong
'Cause I'm afraid they'll leave me, too
Now it's funny but more than ever
I need them now

I still ask my friends what to do
But it seems they don't know
How to bring
How to bring you back
They say, "what made him go?"
Yes, like true friends, they still come around
And say, "I'm sorry you're blue"
Oh, everybody loves me but you
