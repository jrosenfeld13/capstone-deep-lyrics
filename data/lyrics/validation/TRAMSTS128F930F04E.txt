Where we going
Just walking in dinosaur shadows
No way of knowing
How much longer we'll all be surviving

Through the walls of darkness
Can't see the future in my mind
Beggars and whores stand in doors
Cities in flames, cities at war

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead

Raining razors
Rivers running with poisonous water
Drowning the saviors
In the mirror we're still the destroyers

On the edge of darkness
Can't see the future in my mind
Hatred and fear, blood and tears
Babylon calls, pray for us all

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead

Through the walls of darkness
Can't see the future in my mind
Beggars and whores stand in doors
Cities in shock, cities at war

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
