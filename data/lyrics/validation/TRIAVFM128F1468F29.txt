The revolving door
I'm stuck in it, my love
Your cold cold heart that never opens
And never tires

What chance do I have?

Your meteor shower, my love
Did you want to wish on some lucky star
Or did you just want to watch them fall
And burn out

What chance do I have?

Your disappearing act my love
That's an old stand by
And I just want your touch
To never tire

What chance do I have?
