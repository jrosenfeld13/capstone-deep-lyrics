Well the talk on the street
Says you might go solo
A good friend of mine saw you leavin by the back door

I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
If you think youre gonna leave
Then you better say so
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
Because I dont know how long
I can hold on
And if your makin me wait
If youre leadin me on
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)

Who woulda thought
That youd fall for his line
All of a sudden its
Me on the outside

I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
If you think youre gonna leave

Then you better say so
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
Because I dont know how long
I can hold on
And if your makin me wait
If youre leadin me on
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)

I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
If you think youre gonna leave
Then you better say so
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know( I need to know)
Because I dont know how long
I can hold on
And if your makin me wait
If youre leadin me on
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know(I need to know)
I need to know
