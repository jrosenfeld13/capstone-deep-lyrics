I saw you at the seminar
But whose eyes closed first?
Like the shutting of an open door
But I suppose it could be worse
And I would go berserk
If it didn't ever hurt
But I'll never be sure
Exactly what we were

I liked it how it was before
The warmest freezing stare
But I'll keep trudging back for more
There will be something there
A birdcage filled with air
It's not really a secret
It's something you can't share
It's an internal affair
But now that it's official
The time has come to fly
And I must learn your alphabet
So I can spell goodbye
