Attitude check everybody's got x-ray vision
Spot a fake, walk away
'Cause he's not worth my time, precious attention
Does it make you scared to think you stand for something bigger?
But will I ever know 'til you say it with your life?

Chorus
How they love each other
How they shine
And they follow one
We would like to know ourselves

Not your fancy talk, not your upright walk
They're not enough, so chalk one up for love again
Here's the same old good news
When you love, you give
And you can never lose, no never
Does it make you scared to think you
Matter in the bigger picture?
But will I ever know 'til you say it with your life?

Chorus

Make a believer
Make a believer out of me
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason

Chorus
