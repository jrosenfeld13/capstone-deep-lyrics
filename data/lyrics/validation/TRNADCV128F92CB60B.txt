[Chorus]
For the man who feel him a fool
For, he be the wise man
Not for the man who don't feel him a fool
He control his destiny
Yet them's too cool for themselves
For themself
For themself

[Bridge]
'S all I need
Is something to keep me moving on

[Verse 1]
In a world
Full of violent rage
And everybody seems so strange to me

[Chorus]
For the man who feel him a fool
For, he be the wise man
Not for the man who don't feel him a fool
He control his destiny
Yet them's too cool for themselves
For themself
For themself
So (too cool)

[Verse 2]
The weapon of destruction
Swallows people's suffering (They don't need)
In all the confusion
You ain't winning if you're losing
They don't need

[Chorus]
For the man who feel him a fool
For, he be the wise man
Not for the man who don't feel him a fool
He control his destiny
Yet them's too cool for themselves
For themself
For themself
So

[Verse 3]
Even if my heart was gold, yeah
Not even if my soul had wings and I were fly, yeah
Never stoppin' no people
You'll never stop em from crying, no, no
Never stop em from killing
You'll never stop em from trying, no, no

[Chorus]
