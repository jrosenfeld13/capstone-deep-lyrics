Uuuuuh uuh-uuuh
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos

As soon as I love her it's been too long
Talks of future with you caves me in
Swallow my sugar kiss and eat it alone
Hearts get light and smash any dreams of love

These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos, dominos

Three words we shared said too early on
Stuck with forever float upon a tear
Swimming with the fear where we slowly drown
Ending at never arching melody

These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos (dominos)

As soon as I love her it's been too long
And I really loved breaking your heart
These silver apples will shine on I was wrong
The hardest love has the coldest end

These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos (dominos)

Uuuuuh uuh-uuuh
