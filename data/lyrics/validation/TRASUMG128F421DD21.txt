(Don't hold your breath) things will never be the same
From another point of view i am wise to what you do
You left the door unlocked and when i came home
I saw his keys an the floor by the phone tonight
I knew that something wasn't right

Give me one chance
Give me one chance
To settle up this score between us
Before my truck becomes your fate
Give me one chance
I planned the perfect murder
Give me one chance
No one will ever miss her
And now your blood's upon my hands to wash away my sins

(Don't hold your breath)
I promised i'd be home at 10
I trust you with me heart and life
So you sleep with my best friend

Oh my god (Oh my god)
It's 2 am
Oh my god (Oh my god)
With my best friend

You fell asleep with the TV on at night
Sprawled on the floor by my side
Is where i saw him

Give me one chance
Give me one chance
To settle up this score between us
Before my truck becomes your fate
Give me one chance
I planned the perfect murder
Give me one chance
No one will ever miss her
And now your blood's upon my hands to wash away my sins

I'm never taking ya back for what you said
I'm never taking you back for what you did
I'm never taking ya back it's got to end
And i'll never forget so crash this car
The highway's your hell
Let it take you under
