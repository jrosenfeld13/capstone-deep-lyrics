Shake out the anger
Twist out the fear
Stomp on the system
And fly til it's clear
Squeeze out the passion
In your own fashion
Track down the answers
Creeping out of the frame
..and there are things you feel
You should not try to explain
Until you dance yourself sane
Beat out your message
Til someone hears
Pluck up the courage
There's no need for tears
Get back to action and inspiration
You don't need some partner
Crowding out your space
..and there are things you feel
You should not try to explain
Until you dance yourself sane
I want to let my soul guide my body
And let my body please my brain
I want to dance myself sane
Don't you want to dance yourself sane?
Don't just stand there
You've been thinking
Thinking yourself crazy
Why don't you dance yourself sane
Don't you know that standing still
Can damage your health
Shake out the anger
Twist out the fear
Stomp on the system
And fly til it's clear
Squeeze out the passion
In your own fashion
Track down the answers
Creeping out of the frame
..and there are things you feel
You should not try to explain
Until you dance yourself sane
Let's do the dance of sanity
Let's dance for love not vanity
I want to let my soul guide my body
And let my body please my brain
I want to dance myself sane
Don't you want to dance yourself sane?
Don't just stand there
You've been thinking
Thinking yourself crazy
Why don't you dance yourself sane
Don't you know that standing still
Can damage your health
