Years on the run
Boy I know I can take it
And now that I'm here
I know you can't stand the waiting, boy
Let's say no more games
No messing with the mind
Always room for change
Let's give it one more try
(Come on let's give it a try)

I got my bags packed baby and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back baby and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be

If you're good to go
I'm right here for the taking
(Ooh take it, take it, take it)
Don't cross the line
I'll promise you no fakin' boy
(No, no, no, no)
It's all understood
No messing with the rules
(The rules, the rules)
If I let you go
Boy I will be a fool
(What kind of girl wants to be a fool?)

I got my bags packed baby and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back baby and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be

Tell me why we act so stupid, the games we're playing
Life is the cool when we're heading towards the same thing
You are not worthless with love instead of the fighting
Let's get together forever with no more hiding

I got my bags packed baby and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back baby and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be

I got my bags packed baby and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back baby and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be
