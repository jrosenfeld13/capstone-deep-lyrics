I'm just as blue as I can be
Since Susie said goodbye to me
My life is a failure, I see
And she won't be my gal
No mo', no mo', no mo', no mo' - no mo'

I'll pack my things in a grip
Take me a long ocean trip
Out on a great big steam ship
She'll never see her daddy
No mo'- no mo'

Still I hate to say farewell
To my mammy and my sister Nell
They're sure gonna cry
When I tell that I ain't comin' home
No mo' - no mo'

Perhaps I'll be sorry someday
That I leave here and go away
But they need not ask me stay
For I'll never change my mind
No mo' - no mo'

Now whether I'm right or wrong
I'm gonna be gone before long
And then I'll hush this crazy song
And I never will sing
No mo' - no mo'
