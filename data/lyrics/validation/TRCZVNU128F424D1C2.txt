Hey bring your sister, put her on the floor
Don't mind me watching, just walk out through the door
I got a need coming from inside
I got a problem I no longer can denied

Oh!
Tonight I'm gonna make it right
Oh!
Tonight I'll make you fell allright
Breath easy, breath easy

You like it soft, I like it hard
We had our problems all the way from the start
Let's get it on, let's get it right
I promise honey I won't hurt your ass tonight

Oh!
Tonight I'm gonna make it right
Breath easy, breath easy
Oh!
Tonight I'm gonna make you feel allright
Breath easy, breath easy
