I didn't mean to Love you

Sunday Morning waking up and touching you
You're always warm at 9 a.m
Pillows close and I can feel you wanting me
When I go back to sleep again

I didn't mean to love you
And I never meant to care
But I guess I never noticed
Just how often you were there

Walking on and talking till the sun went down
You kept me warm with just your eyes
Seems that all we wanted just came naturally
We never even had to try

I didn't mean to love you
Didn't want to let it show

No I never meant to tell you
I'm just too proud to let on

Bring back the days when we could talk away our troubles
Don't tell me things have changed so much
Please take the time you know it's not so hard to do
Unless there's nothing left to say
I guess there's nothing left to say

I didn't mean to love you
But I guess I always will
Yes you'll always be inside me
Kinda warm and soft and still
I didn't mean to need you
And I didn't want to cry
I never meant to loose you
I never meant good-bye

I never meant good-bye
