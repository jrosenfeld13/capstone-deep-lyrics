[Verse 1:]
Cry
Come to me and cry
I know
I know
I know it's not easy

Your heart is aching
But so is mine
But so is mine
How can I tell you why
For so long

So long
So long I've been thinking
Now I know
I can't live a lie
Can't live a lie

They say true love lasts
Forever if we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance, baby

[Chorus:]
But now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand

Where we went wrong
Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising
My baby
A second chance, baby

But now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand

Where we went wrong
Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising

[Verse 2:]
Go
I must let you go
Don't stop
Don't stop
Cause it's better now

When I still love you
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye

They say true love lasts
Forever if we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance, baby

[Repeat Chorus:]

So long
So long
So long
I went away
So bye for now

Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
So, bye for now

Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
Some other time

So, bye for now
Don't let it die cause
We can try some other time
So, bye for now
Don't let it die
