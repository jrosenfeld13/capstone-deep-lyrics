[Verse 1]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't want you walking away
We're so good together
Tell me it's forever
'Cause I want you to stay

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I just wanna build
My world around you
Don't want you to go

[Chorus 1]
Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless heart
Mm, with my restless heart

[Verse 2]
Tell me where you want me
Anytime, I don't care
Ooh
Tell me when you need me
'Cause baby when you need me
I will be right there
(I will be right there)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I will never build
A wall around you
And I don't want you to go

[Chorus 2]
Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with emotion
Baby right from the start
And the hardest part is being alone
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I just wanna build
My world around you
I don't want you to go

[Chorus 3]
Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless
With my restless

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with emotion
Baby, right from the start
'Cause the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless heart

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart
