Act 2. In which he drives away
(aka CATCH THE SUN)

1969
John Fogerty wrote that bayou song
It was late at night
Forty one years later
I'm driving this car
I think I'm giving up

I think I'll catch the sun
I'm never coming back home

Highway lines go by
I barely hear Graveyard Train in this old car
I'll turn the volume up
You hated this song
I am leaving this town

I think I'll catch the sun
I'm never coming back home

Like a Penthouse Pauper I will choogle tonight
I think Proud Mary may just make me cry
