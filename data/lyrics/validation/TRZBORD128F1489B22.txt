One hundred million souls have joined together
All hope for something better
A daring one just asked a question:
Why does all this work?
'Cause the answers have all lost their meaning
They've got us all believing
We really have a future
And who will get there first?

[Chorus]
Knocked down, stumble and you fall
Sit down; find some use for it all
No way; walk before you crawl
When will you fall?

So many hopeless lives have been forgotten
To feed it once too often
Just hoping to fundraise illusions
To rule by greater force
In the search, we find no solutions
A dream of revolutions
But they find we're part of the problem
Just tell me why this works

[Chorus]
When will you fall?
(When will you fall?)

Knocked down, stumble and you fall
Sit down; find some use for it all
No way; walk before you crawl [x2]

Knocked down. Stay down [x2]

(When will you fall?) [x4]
