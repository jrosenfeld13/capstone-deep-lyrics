Everything's changed
Everything's changed
The closer I get to the top
The more it feels strange

Everything's moved
Everyone move
The closer I get to the drop
The more that I lose

If and or when I might stop
Please do not follow me
If and or when I might drop
Please don't swallow me

Turning round
The sound of falling

Everything's new
Everything's new
The closer I get to the drop
The more my vision pulls me through

Somethings the same
Somethings don't change
The passing of others below
Always remains

If and or when I might stop
Please don't follow me down
Please don't follow me
If and or when I might drop

Please don't swallow me
Please don't follow me
