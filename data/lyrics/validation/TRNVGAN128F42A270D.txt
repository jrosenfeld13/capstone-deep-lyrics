You never woke up beside a stranger
But you never spent the night alone
In your jacket is a flask of Southern Comfort
In your pocket you got a comb
I know you
I know you

You've been pushed right to the limit
Lived on a lonesome road
Chopped up an old pine dresser
To heat the house once in the cold
I know you
Yeah, I know you

Well, I know where you go when you want to be alone
I know just how hard you work and how much money you bring home
You love the sound of church bells but you hate sitting in the pew
Baby, I know you

D.H. Lawrence wouldnt be your favourite poet
If you thought poetry was cool
You have too much pride to be a thief
And just enough gut to be a fool
Baby, I know you, I know you

Well, I know the sound of your thunder
And I know the smell of your rain
I know every time you walk out that door
You might stumble back in it again
Yeah, I know you
Yes I do, baby blue, I know you

Well, I know that you feel bad for every bad thing that you do
You got a scar on your right cheek and the fear of God embedded in you
Your mother had a wooden spoon and a shamrock tattoo
Baby, I know you

Well, no other woman's gonna feel beneath the skin that you are in
No other woman's gonna read your mind or be sorry for your sins
I know you
I know you

Well, I know what you look like just before you cry
I know how to make you sick and I know how to make you die
The only thing I could never do is let you say goodbye
Say goodbye
Cause I know you
I know you

You never woke up beside a stranger
But you never spent the night alone
In your jacket is a flask of Southern Comfort
In your pocket you got a comb
