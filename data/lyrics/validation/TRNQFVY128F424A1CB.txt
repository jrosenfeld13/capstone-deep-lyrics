Me waan, me waan, me waan, say me waan justice
Me waan, me waan, me waan, tell them that me waan justice
See when some people do wrong
They got to stand the penalty
Yet when some men out there do their wrongs
Dem take money and buy out it
How long shall the wicked reign over I people
The Lion, Lion of Judah shall break every chain
Woe unto the one who the offend coming from
Now that our weakness has become strong
Say me waan, me waan, me waan, yes me waan justice
So long ago I say, me waan, me waan, tell them that
Me waan justice, oh yeah
I've seen sufferation and I've seen starvation
Only one thing can stand continually - salvation, salvation
The rockin' reggae vibration
Yes me waan, me waan, me tell them that me waan justice
