He doesn't have a friend just some occupations
Staring at the sky or at computer screens
It gets you in the neck, all this looking skywards
But every marty knows that you suffer in belief

But if only you could see that things that he has seen!
'Cos he knows that he can tell you just what all this means

He knows, it's true that they're our there
He knows, it's true that they're our there
And there's very little faith left on this world

There's so much in the sky, it must be hiding something
He thinks that he's prepared and he's counting down the days

And if only you could see the things that he has seen!
'Cos he's sure that he could tell you just what all this means

It's so easy when we sneer
And mock the faith that he holds dear
But just like us he's chasing dreams

If you look hard enough then you'll see it clearly
There's something that we need always coming from the sky

And there's very little faith left on this world
