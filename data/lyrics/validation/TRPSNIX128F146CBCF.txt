Well broken child don't be afraid
So many years, your future hasn't been made
Some day you will understand
I wish I could hold your hand
But I'm doing the best that I can
Doing the best that I can

When the love/hate days turned into years
Voices of your teardrops whispered into my ears
She lives in a different world
Says I'm not in love with her
But I'm doing the best that I can
Doing the best that I can
On my own

In the fight for life who's gonna win
Millions of people try to get a word in
You might be the last of mine
I wish that I could force a smile
But I'm doing the best that I can
Doing the best that I can
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

And you know there's a feeling
That a new day's on the rise
And it scares me in a way
But somehow I feel alive
So don't tell me that you're leaving
'Cause I won't know what to say
When I'm going ahead with my plans
Yes, I'm going ahead with my plans

Do you realize that you have just kissed, kissed, kissed it all away
Cause I was there when nobody cared if you lived or you died this day
Well now that you're back on your feet
Oh, you don't even talk to me
But I'm doing the best that I can
Yes, I'm doing the best that I can
On my own
On my own
