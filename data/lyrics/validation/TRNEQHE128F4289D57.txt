Just across Tomorrow Mountain
There's a happy city, they say
Where the people are grand and time is planned
So it's Christmas everyday

'Neath the scotch and soda fountain
There's a treat in store for us guys
Under cigarette trees, we'll take our ease
While the cops fan off the flies

There you will be a lucky sinner
With no conscience for your guide
Each horse you pick will be a winner
And the doors of every bank are open wide

Far across Tomorrow Mountain
There's a life that's fancy and free
On a platinum street we'll plant our feet
It's the land that's fair to see
Won't you hurry there with me?

Just across Tomorrow Mountain
Every girl is Queen of the May
And the kitchens, I'm told are lined with gold
And there ain't no bills to pay

Can't you cross that distant mountain
Where it rains Chanel No.5?
And the gutters, I think are paved with mink
And the diamond bushes thrive

Pigs trot around already roasted
Won't you have a slice of ham?
Marshmallows bloom, already toasted
And the clouds are made of marmalade and jam

Can't you see Tomorrow Mountain?
Can't you watch it glimmer and glow?
It's a wonderful town that's upside down
And it's full of easy dough
Won't you pack your bags and go?
