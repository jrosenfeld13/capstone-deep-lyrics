Ain't nobody tells me what to do now
I've heard all the lies and been promised the world
No business man is going to use or confuse me
'Cause I ain't no puppet for his capital gain

And what do you get but exploitation?
From creeps who are going to ignore your situation
Too many people getting pushed around
Going to end up down the lost and found

They say I got to respect the system
But there ain't no respect in that system for me
You got to be satisfied and show no resistance
If you want to get to the top of that tree

And what do you get but exploitation?
From creeps who are going to ignore your situation
Too many people getting pushed around
Going to end up down the lost and found

They give you media minds to keep you satisfied
Then take you brain away to appease and make you smile
No more!

Ain't nobody tells me what to do now
I've heard all the lies and been promised the world
No business man is going to use or confuse me
'Cause I ain't no puppet for his capital gain

And what do you get but exploitation?
From creeps who are going to ignore your situation
Too many people getting pushed around
Going to end up in the lost and found

And that ain't me, babe
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
