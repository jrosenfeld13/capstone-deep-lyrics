Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine
Melting in a pot of thieves
Wild card up my sleeve
Thick, heart of stone
My sins my own, they belong to me
Me

People said "Beware"
But I don't care
Their words are just rules and regulations to me
Me

I walk in a room
You know I look so proud
I move in this here atmosphere where
Anything's allowed
And I go to this here party
And I just get bored
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
Humping on a parking meter
Leaning on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling
That I'm going to make her mine

Oh I'll put my spell on her
Here she comes
Walking down the street
Here she comes
Coming through my door
Here she comes
Crawling up my stair
Here she comes
Waltzing through the hall
In a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good
Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling
That I'm going to make her mine

Then I hear this knocking on my door
Hear this knocking on my door
And I look up to the big tower clock
And say, "Oh my God here's midnight"
And my baby is walking through the door
Leaning on my couch
She whispers to me
And I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good
Oh, she was so fine
And I'm going to tell the world
That I just made her mine

And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is

I was at the stadium
There were two thousand girls
Called their names out to me
Marie, Ruth, but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them
I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chiming in my heart
Going Ding Dong, Ding Dong
Ding Dong, Ding Dong
Ding Dong, Ding Dong
Ding Dong, Ding Dong
Chiming the time when you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh, you were so good
Oh, you were so fine
And I've got to tell the world
That I made her mine, made her mine
Made her mine, made her mine
Made her mine, made her mine

G L O R I A (Gloria) x 4

Tower bells chime
Ding Dong, they chime
They're singing
"Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine"

Gloria, (G L O R I A)
