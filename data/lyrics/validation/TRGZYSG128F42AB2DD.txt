[Intro]
I believed that someone'd
Take care of me tonight

[Verse 1]
As I walk into Dorian's
Can you see it in my eyes?
(yeah)
My boots are on the mend
And they ain't walking home
Street tar in summer'll do a job on your soul[x2]
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Junie's watching cover shy
My head's feeling light
I believed that someone'd
Take care of me tonight
Anyhow, anyway, so I split
Oh just getting out of there
What's going to get me out of this?
I spent the night in the map room
I humanize the vacuum

[Verse 3]
I believed that someone'd
Take care of me tonight
Oh and as I'm lookin out at you
Can you see that in, in my eyes
On the mend
Now they could lead me home
Street tar in summer
Will play a trick on your soul

[Refrain]
Oh Junie's got daylight
(yeah)
Aw it made me feel so light
(aw yeah)
Just something to take care of the light

[Refrain]
Junie's watching daylight
(yeah)
All there is to feel a light
(aw yeah)
Someone to take care of the light

[Outro]
Ooh
All the weird kids up front
(yeah)
Tell me what you know you want
(aw yeah)
Someone to take care of tonight... aww
