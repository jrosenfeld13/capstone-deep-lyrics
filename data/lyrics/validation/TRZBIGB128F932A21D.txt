("How can you expect to defeat me, when you are but a man?")

We are searching for technology
The fate in our hands
We want to be intelligent
The future has no end
Our product has high quality
Important for our land
A progress for the industry
And we like to present

One day we will defeat the time
In the moment that we feel like birds in sky
One day the time will come to fly
Into the past, into the future, into decline

We are deforming the velocity
No pangs of conscience
We want to be successfully
The aim is in near distance
The result of a prodigy
But force fields breaking down
Loss of orbital gravity
Solutions must be found

One day we will defeat the time
In the moment that we feel like birds in sky
One day the time will come to fly
Into the past, into the future, into decline
