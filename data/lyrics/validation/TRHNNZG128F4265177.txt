This world is wicked
I fit right in
We've been waiting for you, boy
Where you been?

I don't need no one to love me
I don't need no one to fetch my water
Come on get your money, child
It's a fine, fine day

I don't love you any more
Baby
Snap my crooked fingers
And you blow away

Say you want someone to love you
Say you want a fleeting memory
Come a little closer
Things ain't what they seem to be

Believe
What you see
Nothing else
Even dreams
I can't breathe
I can't see
I feel love
I feel love

This world is wicked
It's beautiful
You better play both sides
Or they'll think you an animal

Come on get your money, baby
Come on get your one time, one time
Come on get your loving, girl
It's a fine, fine day
