Sweet intoxication
The celebration of my falling bright star
Another way to call a wrong evaluation
Shes sucking out my life
Closing my eyes
Is she the one Ive waited for?

Dancing with illusions
The consecration of my flaring black pearl
Another time a wrong brilliant expectation
I kissed her lips again
Trying to avoid the danger
But now shes breaking down my heart

The dream is over
Is it something to die for
The dream is over
I wanna break it down
Scream and cry live to hide
Your world is crumbling into dust
It s raining lies
More and more
Looking for the escape door
Scream and cry live to hide
Your hopes have crumbled into dust
Dream and die
Love no more
Looking for the escape door

Sparkling conversations
The coronation of my precious rain drop
Another new dark road brings us nowhere
Theres nothing left to say
I close my eyes
Is she the one Ive waited for?

The dream is over
Is it something to die for
The dream is over
I wanna break it down
Scream and cry live to hide
Your world is crumbling into dust
It s raining lies
More and more
Looking for the escape door
Scream and cry live to hide
Your hopes have crumbled into dust
Dream and die
Love no more
Looking for the escape door
