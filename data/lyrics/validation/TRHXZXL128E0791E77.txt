[Verse 1]
Just off of the two-lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden A-frame with a yellow tin roof top
One day it was raining on this world
She said have you ever really, really ever kissed a girl?

[Chorus]
Baby Ill be your Huckleberry, you dont have to double dare me
If the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Youre so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
Well grow up and well get married
Im going to be your Huckleberry

[Verse 2]
Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared
It was two bucks to experience the thrill
She said come on boy lets get in line Ill ride it if you will

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior/senior prom
Went looking for some romance before I had to get her home
Steaming up the windows of my car
She said until I get my wedding ring boy we cant go that far

[Chorus]
Baby Ill be your Huckleberry, you dont have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Youre so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We grew up and we got married
Now look at those three little Huckleberries
