[Chorus][x2]
Get on the Right Track Baby
Get on the Right Track Ba - by
Get on the Right Track Baby, yeah
Come on home and treat me wrong again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been so blue and lonely
I've tried both night and day
But I'm begging you just one more time
Come back if you don't stay

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you know I love you
But yet you broke my heart in two
But it's because I love you
That I don't care what you do

[Chorus 2]
Get on the Right Track Baby
You better come home now
Get on the Right Track Baby, yeah
Come on home and treat me wrong again

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm begging you one more time, baby
Down on bended knees
Please, please come back home
And give my poor heart ease

[Chorus]
Get on the Right Track Baby
Get on the Right Track Ba - by
Get on the Right Track Baby, yeah
Come on home and treat me wrong again
That's what I say know
