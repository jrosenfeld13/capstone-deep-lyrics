I look at this mountain
So many heartaches wide
I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side

I've got to be honest
I've got my doubts
These tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love?

Baby, I'll tell you something
To help us through this long, dark night

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
But trust me, baby this is love

Love isn't easy
I'm torn, I confess
When a heart is uncertain
It's bound to second guess

This love won't forsake us
So dry your tears I promise you

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
But trust me, baby this is love

I'm here for you baby
There's nothing I want more
Our day is coming
And we'll reach that peaceful shore

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
But trust me, baby this is love

One more mountain, hey, so what
Trust me baby, this is love
Oh yes it is, baby
This is love

When this trouble passes over
When this trouble passes over
This is love
When this trouble passes over
When this trouble passes over
