Ding dong merrily on high
The Christmas bells are ringing
Ding dong joyously reply
The angels all a' singing
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

Ding dong carol all the bells
Ring out the Christmas story
Ding dong sound the good noels
God's son has come in glory
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

Ding dong merrily on high
The Christmas bells are ringing
Ding dong joyously reply
The angels all a' singing
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
