Patience. Give me your patience
I will give you this world
Not much time to fucking disgrace me
Too much time to fucking deface me
My mind is here and it's fucking set
My mind's here and I won't regret
Now we've got to see
We're going to make a change
To bring myself to man
To make myself a man
I know, the life that I lead
May bring disgust, may cause disgust
Discipline and the motivation must be kept until the end
Never give up to the fucking opposition
Never give up to the fucking oppression
Not much time to fucking disgrace me
Now we've go to see
We're gonna make amends
Bring ourselves above
To bring ourselves above
There's not much time to waste
This is the place to live
This is the place to live
There comes a time
In all our lives
You must sacrifice
Put you in the ground
Not much time to fucking disgrace me
Now we've got to see
I'm gonna make myself a man
Gain integrity, and do the best I can
I know the voice that I breathe
The blood that I bleed
You'll never believe
Too much time to lose
Not much time to waste
There Comes a time
No falling
No entry
No forgiving
Come on now, this is the...
Come on - I'm the enemy
Try to - step to me
What you gonna do
Can't pull me down
