How long you gonna make me wait
Tell me what it's gonna take
Boy you got that thing I really need
Baby give me a clue
Now I leave it up to you

Let's keep it on the low
Boy you put your trust in me
They don't need to know the truth
The way I feel for you
So watcha gonna do when my love is here for you?

Paradise
That's where I am
When I make love to you
Boy you take me there
This I swear

Paradise
When you touch me
In the places you do
I can't wait no more
Take me there tonight

Won't you make up your mind
Thought about a thousand times
Tell me what to do to make you mine
I think about you every day
Thoughts of you won't go away

Let's keep it on the low
Boy you put your trust in me
They don't need to know the truth
The way I feel for you
So watcha gonna do when my love is here for you?

Paradise
That's where I am
When I make love to you
Boy you take me there
This I swear

Paradise
When you touch me
In the places you do
I can't wait no more
Take me there tonight

It's time to tell the truth
It's time that you confess
Be honest with me baby
I know you're feeling this
Do you need for me
Like I feel for you
Tell it to me baby
So whatcha gonna do

Wait a minute, ma, let me let you know what i'm in to
To know where I'm going
Gotta know what I've been trough
Hustler
Never been the type to sweat you
But I must admit you're looking good in your jeans, boo
Can we rendez-vous at the hotel around noon?
Can you keep a secret 'bout the things that we do?
If you can we can go to paradise, boo

Me and you
Me and you
Me and you

Paradise
That's where I am
When I make love to you
Boy you take me there
This I swear

Paradise
When you touch me
In the places you do
I can't wait no more
Take me there tonight
