[Verse 1]
Like Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales
When three men find a pot of gold
And end up killing one another in the name of greed

[Chorus]
Some people are poison
Under my skin like opium
And I'll stare in their eye to annoy them
Yeah, they're poison
Yeah, they're poison

[Verse 2]
Admissions of liabilities
I'm living in my own private cold war
In a room full of spies and I cannot find the door

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The violent aspects of a tattered man
Let me respond to that if I can
Illuminated manuscripts written by hand
Accusations have been made from the very beginning

[Chorus]

Yeah, they're fucking poison!
