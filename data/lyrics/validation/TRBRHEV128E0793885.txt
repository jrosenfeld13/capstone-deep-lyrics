There's a man in town all the women know
He goes by the name of Nosey Joe
He don't care if they're married
He takes his pick
Long as they're women, he's ready to stick

His big nose in their business
His big nose in their business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

He ain't good lookin' and he ain't big and stong
The guy's got a nose that's four foot long
I'm tellin' you women, this ain't no jive
If you get too close this man will drive

His big nose in your business
His big nose in your business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

I saw him just the other day
Tried to steal my gal away
He offered her money
He offered her love
She said thank you sir, but please don't shove

Your big nose in my business
Your big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

Old Nosey finally lost his life
Messin' with my buddy's wife
My buddy caught him with his chick
Chopped off his nose, now he can't stick

His big nose in my business
His big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know
