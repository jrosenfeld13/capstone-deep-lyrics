Who's that walkin' round here?
Mercy, sounds like baby patter
Baby elephant patter, that's what I calls it

Say, up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us: me, your big feet, and you
From your ankle up, I'll say you sure are sweet
From there down there's just too much feet

Yes, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Can't use you 'cause you feet's too big
I really hate you 'cause your feet's too big

Where'd you get 'em?
Your girl she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in paradise
She said likes your face, she likes your array
Man, oh man, them things are too big

Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big

My Goodness! Gun the gunboats!
Ship, ship, ship!

Oh your pedal extremities are colossal
To me, you look just like a fossil
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin'
'Cause your feet's too big, yeah

Come on and walk that thing
Oh, I've never heard of such walkin', mercy
Your, your pedal extremities really are obnoxious
One never knows, do one?
