I'm as free a little bird as I can be
I'm as free a little bird as I can be
Sitting on the hillside, a-weeping all day
I'm as free a little bird as I can be

Take me home little birdie, take me home
Take me home little birdie, take me home
Take me home little birdie, for I love no other
Take me home little bird, take me home

I can't stay here by myself
I can't stay here by myself
I can't stay here neither nowhere else
I can't stay here by myself

I'm as free a little bird as I can be
I'm as free a little bird as I can be
Sitting on the hillside, a-weeping all day
I'm as free a little bird as I can be

Take me home little birdie, take me home
Take me home little birdie, take me home
Take me home little birdie, for I love no other
Take me home little bird, take me home
