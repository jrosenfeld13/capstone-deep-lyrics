He was standin' at the big load in
When all the trucks and buses rolled up
Dirty jeans and a leather jacket
Full of patches of all those heavy bands
He wasn't very hard to talk to
And looked like he had nowhere to go

Easy, easy rocker
Always on the run
Easy, easy rocker
Together we'll be strong

Now the stage is a white burnin' fire
And the planet is ready to explode
The music is new and the music is hot
And we all came here for the magic ride
The scream of eternal life
Runs through every ice cold soul tonight

Now the seats and the streets and the bars
Are runnin' empty
But the sounds and the songs and the lights
Still splash your brain
I can see in your eyes what you need
And I just call you
