Took a walk around the block
I bought a candle, it was flaming red, flaming red
I thought a thought then I forgot
So I sang a happy song in my head, in my head

I wore my red shoes, wore my red shoes again
They're getting worn out from all of the wandering
Worn out and holy, holy as Jesus
Me and my red shoes, nothing can please us

Stupid girl, she was dressed like
She deserved everything that she got
Bloody pumps, dead girl
Hey, world, thanks a lot, thanks a lot

I wore my red shoes, wore my red shoes again
They're getting worn out from all of the wandering
Worn out and holy, holy as Jesus
Me and my red shoes, nothing can, nothing can please us

Flaming red, flaming red
Flaming red, flaming red
Flaming red, flaming red
Flaming red, flaming

Walking in my red shoes, and I get so worn out and I'm
Walking in my red shoes, and my soles are torn out and I'm
Walking in my red shoes, and I'm holy as Jesus and I'm
Walking in my red shoes, and nothing can, nothing can please us
