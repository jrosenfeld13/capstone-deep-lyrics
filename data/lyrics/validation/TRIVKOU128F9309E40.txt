If I could swallow the sky
And the mountains too
I'd do it
So there'd be nothing
To fall on you
Cause in a world full of wonders
Dont let it openly wonder
When there's still little wonder left in you

And all I wanna do
Oh, oh, oh
Is show you how easy it could be your
For you to paint back the colors
Like the green in your tree
Before it all fades away

They say there's no roads where we're going
Let's prove them wrong
If I could I would level the land
So we could keep moving on
Cause in a world full of magic
It's never, never tragic
When there's still a little magic left in you

And all I wanna do
Oh, oh, oh
Is show you how easy it could be
Oh, oh, oh
For you to paint back the colors
Like the green in your tree
Before it all fades away

When it's cold outside
And your sun's all Ill be
You been sleeping too long
And you dried up all your dreams
Don't you know that
There's really no such thing
As an endless night
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So let's make a little magic
Oh, oh, oh
Just to put things right
Oh, oh, oh

And all I wanna do
Is show you how easy it could be
All I really wanna do
Is show you how easy it could be
For you to paint back the colors
Like the green in your tree
Before it all fades away
And all I wanna do
All I really wanna do
