Choked
I feel choked
Eternal choke
Around my neck
Sin
The sin is fake
Devoid of sense
Destroys the evidence

Swallow your lies
Swallow your lies
Your pain will strike

And I will stay here to complain
My hope is so falling away
And I lose all my sanity
Till destroying the chosen way

More
We want more
A long and wrong life

I choke

Devoid of sense
Your pain will strike
And I will stay here to complain
Till destroying the chosen way

The sin is fake
Destroys the evidence
I feel choked
Eternal choke

Beyond redemption
Rise up in your lies
How can I stay deaf to the call
A long and boring life
