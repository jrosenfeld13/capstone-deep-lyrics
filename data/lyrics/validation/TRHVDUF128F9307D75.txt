If I won't live a lie it's in my self defence
That I remember hiding then
If I'm eroding all the innocence
Am I running rigid once again?

And he won't hear me now in the darkest hour
I'll never see him now
Oh I can take the mystery in the darkest hour
And he won't hurt me now

If we are lost in paradise
Our recollection all but gone
We will make the only sacrifice
For the strength to carry on

In spite of everything I recognise the end
And feel the scars that never heal
I keep the purity, buried as I am
In an effort to conceal

Don't underestimate what I've retained
All my souvenirs, forget-me-nots
I'll pretend all you want me to
I won't believe it if you don't

Burn it up again, it's here and I've
Let it live through other stolen lives
Save your hollow breath
Feast your tired eyes
You need protection as well as I

Nothing any good ever came from me
Thought I could run you in the ground

What do I do, what kind of fool
Covers you like an animal?
Out of the way
I'm anyone wilder than you are
Anyone who ever had a heart
Wouldn't deny me

Woe betide the one, not to be outdone
Who will remember all that stuff
Didn't I say it then enough?
If I could let it be, I would
Start it again, when does it end?
I'm in there somewhere
Nobody can carry me over

Now the dead winds have blown
With the cold rains
If I should fall from your side
Keep it in your mind
How I tried to keep him here
How I promised he'd be safe
And he never said a word
And he never cried

Another day leads me on
And I will follow
Whatever it takes now, I'll do
If it's over
And he won't hurt me now, I know
When I'm losing all the power
And he won't hurt me now
In this darkest hour
