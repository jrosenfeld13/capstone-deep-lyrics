Hear the coyotes howlin' out beyond the trees
Sound like they killed somethin' out there
And left it to bleed
They'll rip your guts apart and fight over the bones
They won't remember you. Tomorrow you'll be gone
But cry me one tear
So I'll know that I made you feel good and secure in your world
And that I meant somethin' to you
Cry me one tear. Cry me one tear
Or else it was all a lie
And we could never really say goodbye
'cause we never said hello
A cold darkness has fallen upon the land
We're all at the mercy of the red right hand
I thought you were on my side, but the past makes things clear
Open eyes are the ones that shed tears
It's a disposable society with styrofoam constitution
Whoever said that honesty was the best solution?
I thought I heard you say I love you
There was a time when I thought this could be true
But cry me one tear
So I'll know I made you feel good and secure in your world
And that I meant somethin' to you
Cry me one tear. Cry me one tear
Or else it was all a lie
