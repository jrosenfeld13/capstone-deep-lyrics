See it's comin', it's callin'
See it's comin', it's callin'

D'ya wonder planet's callin' revenge
Look up over there what a grey sky
Comin' atc'ha doesn't really mater who you are
No fame, money, trust

I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's, gonna lead your moves?

When it's callin' you just gotta move on
Gettin' out of your car to see it goin' so far
Everybody's tunin' with the frequency
Bring the bass on the top of the car

Get up, get on it
There's a million people down the streets
We're gonna raise this vibe up to the sky
And he'll bring it back, vibration's cut

(See it's comin', it's callin')
We were comin' back from nowhere
(See it's comin', it's callin')
Failed decodin' message from above
(See it's comin', it's callin')
It seems we're goin' to light a new star
(See it's callin' down)

I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?

When it's callin', you be ready or not
Takin' all you can to the bag
But there's nothin' you are leavin' here
That you will not find in the new place

No fear to the final edge
Be what you wanna be, do what you wanna do
It's now or never, take a chance to find your way

(See it's comin', it's callin')
We were comin' back from nowhere
(See it's comin', it's callin')
Failed decodin' message from above
(See it's comin', it's callin')
It seems we're goin' to light a new star
(See it's callin' down)

I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?

D'ya wonder planet's callin' revenge
Look up over there what a gray sky
Comin' atc'ha, doesn't really matter who you are
No fame, money, trust

See it's callin'
See it's callin'
It's callin'
See it's callin' down

I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?

I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes
Who's, who's gonna lead your moves?
