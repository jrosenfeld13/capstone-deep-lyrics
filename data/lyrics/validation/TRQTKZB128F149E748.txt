It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You've been content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
You are the wind beneath my wings
