[K. Vanderhoof / R. Munroe]

You've got to live for the moment, you've got to go for the throat
You're given only one chance and you know that life's too short
Feel your pulse getting stronger, no fear in your eyes
Never showing weakness and you never compromise

The hero's soul, drifting forever
The hero's soul, always searching for better
Until the end of the road

Adversity is a challenge it's not something you ignore
And your life is such a struggle and your back's against the wall
Lost in swirling madness, lost without a home
Just rid yourself of torment and hit the open road

The hero's soul, drifting forever
The hero's soul, always searching for better
Until the end of the road

The journey through this life can be an unforgiving hell
Your loneliness is safety , as far as I can tell
You've put your best foot forward, you've taken two steps back
You're getting nowhere faster and now there's no turning back

The hero's soul, drifting forever
The hero's soul, always searching for better
Until the end of the road
