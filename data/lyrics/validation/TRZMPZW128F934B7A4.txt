[Verse 1]
I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes Sunday girl
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl

[Verse 2]
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I say awake all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

[Verse 3]
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams Sunday girl

[Verse 4]
Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home Sunday girl

[Verse 5]
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl

[Verse 6]
When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

[Verse 7]
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I say awake all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me
I got the blues
