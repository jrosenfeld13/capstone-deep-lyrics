Underneath the broken mask
Expose the skin in a flash
The skin reflects a silent trust
In between two who are touched

The perfect are marked for life
The slow decay they try to hide
We are told not to watch
An image says so much

Surrounded by these photographs
Each one has a negative
In the spring two more jumped
On this day she'll become one of us
