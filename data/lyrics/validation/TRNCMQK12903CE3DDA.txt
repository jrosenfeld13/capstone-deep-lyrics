Sitting on the corner, didnt see my finger tips
Its not for show
But please dont tell me, cause I already know
Now whos got the number of my, unfortunately
Im beginning to remember that shes not calling me
I slip, with this thing that I should try
With this {inaudible], that Im living just to die
She comes by to tell me that shes gone
Im hurting inside of this song, all for you
Did you think that I could smile this easily, oh oh
This composure is proven to be deadly, oh
Proven deadly

[Guitar solo]
Still Im waiting for my run away lover
As if I didnt notice that its so undercover, oh
Its been 3 years now in this recent history, oh
And whats stopped you is what stopped me
Goodbye
