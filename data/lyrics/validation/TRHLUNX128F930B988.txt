Left the big city think it was yesterday Got in some trouble there but thats the price you pay for living underground just stay put and believe in the good times you can have right down the street You go to the show cause you know that your friends are there watching your face for any trace or hint of fear parking lot packed to the max the people in the back are smoking phat sacks of big buds and getting whack

Stomp your steel tip boots some more Not enough movement on the dance floor

The crowd leaves they go home for the night no money in their pockets still sore from the bloody fight The guitars and the amplifiers are ringing in their ears the set the sound the fucking knobs the floor soaked with blood and beer, bottles and cans and piles of broken glass stacked to the max near the jukebox in the back skinheads in the alley are all looking for a fight the punks in the front are getting drunk and about to start a riot

Stomp your steel tip boots some more not enough movement on the dance floor I just came here for some fun Now it looks like I'm the only one

Next thing you know you wake up the next day find you lying on your back different home different state removed from the destruction that you once knew as home removed from the destruction rude boy you're not alone

Stomp your steel tip boots some more not enough movement on the dance floor I just came here for some fun Now it looks like I'm the only one
