Didn't you think
Didn't you care
Didn't you see him
Crying there
Listen up
Listen why
This is how
You let him die
Here's your plan
Here's your crime
Here's your ...
Killing time

Each day of your life
You ... try
Each day of your life
You wonder why
You wonder why
You wonder why
You wonder why
You wonder why

In time you will know
How it feels to be let go
You take my hand
Stare at the sky
When you go don't say good bye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
