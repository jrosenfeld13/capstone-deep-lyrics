(feat. Cindy Greene & Lizzy Yoder)
Oh, oh, oh...
All alone...
'gone out
So many nights
Nobody's there
Lost and wasted
Why am I alone?
Who made me this way?
(Natural Disaster)
All alone, alone
Why am I alone?
I feel so alone
Natural disaster (disaster)
Natural disaster (disaster)
Oh, this night mistrust (heartless rust)
Who made me this way?
Blinding, spinning, shining, bright and burning, ruined, dead, hurting
Blinding, spinning, shining, bright and burning, ruined, dead, hurting
Light is blinding, spinning and shining, bright and burning, ruined and hurting, colours are flashing, in the dark smoke, mirrors the face is hoping, I can re - member why I, came here before, I don't know how I, feel like I don't know, I feel like I don't know, how will I feel like, I don't know how I, feel like I don't know, how will I feel, I, how will I feel, I
(All alone, all alone, all alone)
