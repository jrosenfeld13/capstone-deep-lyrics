[Intro]
You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., Pretty Young Thing

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from lady?
And ooh won't you take me there
Right away won't you baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature
Sugar fly with me
Don't you know now
Is the perfect time
We can make it right
Hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the loving pain
Let me take you to the max

[Hook]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love and care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love and care
And I'll take you there
Anywhere you want to go
(Yes, I will)

[Verse 2]
Nothing can stop this burning
Desire to be with you
Got to get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearning
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right
In the night
Hit the loving spot
I'll give you all I've got

[Hook ]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love and care
And I'll take you there
(Yes, I will)
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love and care
And I'll take you there
(Yes, I will)
