I don't need to wake up
Dreaming of this
Don't ask me to keep in touch
Don't feel bad
No, please don't feel bad
I'm still fond of you
Just don't feel bad
Maybe we will never see each other again
Maybe we will finally be doing what is right
Maybe we will finally be doing what you want
Just don't feel bad
And don't ask me to keep in touch
