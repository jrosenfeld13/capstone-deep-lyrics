Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here
Now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here
Now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy

Now you're gone
There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it will break apart
It won't heal it never fades away
I will think about you everyday

[Instrumental]

(Ready for takeoff)

Now your gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here
Now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy
Now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here
Now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With the pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy
Now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I will think about you everyday
