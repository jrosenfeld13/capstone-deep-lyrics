I'm the Urban Spaceman, baby
I've got speed
I've got everything I need
I'm the Urban Spaceman, baby
I can fly
I'm a supersonic guy

I don't need pleasure
I don't feel pain
If you were to knock me down
I'd just get up again
I'm the Urban Spaceman, baby
I'm making out
I'm all about

I wake up every morning with a smile upon my face
My natural exuberance spills out all over the place

I'm the Urban Spaceman
I'm intelligent and clean
Know what I mean?
I'm the Urban Spaceman
As a lover, second to none
It's a lot of fun

I never let my friends down
I've never made a boob
I'm a glossy magazine, an advert in the tube
I'm the Urban Spaceman, baby, here comes the twist
I don't exist
