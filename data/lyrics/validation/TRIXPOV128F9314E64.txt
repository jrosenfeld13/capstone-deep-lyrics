[Verse 1]
Always thought your promise was for life
I did not think that I
Would hear you say goodbye
And I always heard you led another life
I doubted every time
I guess my love was blind
But in my eyes
Love was always something magical
But the feeling is so tragical
And all I know is in love
The thing I want most
I can't possess
There's only emptiness

[Chorus]
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
You lied
As you kissed me goodnight
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
I cried
As you kissed my lips good-bye, good-bye

[Verse 2]
In my eyes
You will always be the lucky one
'Cause you know you'll always have my love
For all times
Until I die
Through the end I give to you my best
You gave, you gave me loneliness

[Chorus]
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
You lied
As you kissed me goodnight
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
I cried
As you kissed my lips good-bye
