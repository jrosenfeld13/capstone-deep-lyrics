You're gonna tear down the walls
You're gonna scream for change
You're gonna make a difference now
They're gonna hear it again
Well I don't believe it
And I can't see it
There is a will and a way I'm happy to say
But the answer's not in your basement
This time - down time
Your cover's blown you're on your own this time
Down time now you're on your own
Look around - up and down
There are people sleeping on the ground
There are problems way more real
Than a gang or a scene or a record deal
And I don't believe it
My eyes have seen it
Nothing you can say will make it go away
The answer's in your actions
When times go bad and we're so quick to run away
In the down time will you see it through ?
