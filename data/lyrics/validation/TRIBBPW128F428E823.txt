I went to see my doctor  Feeling mighty low
He said "Good Lord above  I wonder how your blood can flow"
I said "its mighty simple  it's oh so plain to see
It's just my perspiration  what my baby do to me
She gives me High Fever  Heh  Heh
She gives me High Fever
She gives me High Fever
Up and down  up and down  up and down my spine  Yeh!
My temperature was rising  my skin was turning blue
I said "Oh doctor help me  Ain't there something you can do?
Cos when she squeeze me tight  I think I'll go insane
Adrenaline starts a'racing and it's pounding through my brain
She gives me High Fever now  Heh  Heh
She gives me High Fever
She gives me High Fever
Up and down  up and down  up and down my spine  Oow!
She gives me High Fever now  Heh  Heh
She gives me High Fever now
She gives me High Fever
Up and down  up and down  up and down my spine  Oh!
The doc gave me prescriptions  powders, potions, pills
And guaranteed these remedies will take away my ills
Physiotherapicology  Psychoanalogy too
Computerised and factors form mutating them to you
She gives me High Fever  She gives me High Fever
She gives me High Fever
Up and down  up and down  up and down my spine
Oh High Fever now  she gives me High Fever now
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey  Heh
Oh High Fever now  Hey - Heh
