Well a train blows a whistle before it pulls away
But no word or warning do you say
One minute right beside me, another you're a thousand miles away

Well I felt such a shaking and I heard such a whirr
And I swore we were moving fast enough to blur
Then I opened up my eyes and found that we're right back where we were

Baby you're no train, you're the track
Always running away, always running back
Baby you're no train, you're the steam blowing by

How I longed for the journey, and those far distant lands
I believed all your promises and plans
Now I'm standing at the station with a lonely ticket in my hand

Baby you're no train, you're the track
Always running away and running back
Baby you're no train, you're the silence behind
So roll on
