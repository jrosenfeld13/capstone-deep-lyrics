[Verse 1]
I woke up early in my hotel room
Wait for my alarm to go
I think about the things Ive got to do
Damn my mind is going to blow

[Pre-Chorus]
Im freaking out about whats ahead
Maybe Ill just stay in bed
Cause its no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

[Chorus]
Youre looking for something you can find
If you give it up youll lose your mind
Theres always something in your way
But what can you say
Youre gonna have a good day

[Verse 2]
I quit my job about a week ago
Told them that I need some time
Now Im going strong
Ill make it through
Doctor says Im doing fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Im freaking out about whats ahead
Maybe Ill just stay in bed
Cause its no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

[Chorus]
Youre looking for something you can find
If you give it up youll lose your mind
Theres always something in your way
But what can you say
Youre gonna have a good day

[Verse 3]
Just when I thought I couldnt lose
I realized its the only thing I knew
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Im freaking out about whats ahead
Maybe Ill just stay in bed
Cause its no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself
Tell it to myself
Tell it to myself again

[Bridge]
Youre looking for something you can find
If you give it up youll lose your mind
Theres always something in the way
Youre looking for something you can find
If you give it up youll lose your mind
Theres always something in your way
But what can you say

[Chorus]
Youre looking for something you can find
If you give it up youll lose your mind
Theres always something in your way
But what can you say
Youre gonna have a good day
Youre gonna have a good day
Youre gonna have a good day
