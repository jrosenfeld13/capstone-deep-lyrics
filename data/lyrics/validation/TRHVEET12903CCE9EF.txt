Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' doll
Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk, so no big hunk
Can steal her away from me
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' doll
