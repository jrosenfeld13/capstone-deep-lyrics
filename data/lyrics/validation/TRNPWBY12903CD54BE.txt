One day Im gonna swim this lake I swear it
Im gonna swim it end to end
Im bound to paddle on upriver
Out by the delta where the fishin boats come in

One day Im gonna catch the biggest catfish
The one that always got away
Dust off your finest china dishes
Were gonna have him on a plate

One mornin fore the sun rise one mornin fore the light
One mornin fore the mean old rooster has cried
One mornin fore the trucks roll blowin their horn
We gonna take the whole world on by the storm

Someday Im gonna make a ton a money
Im gonna tuck it in the bank
So we aint ever goin hungry
Theyll have to add another safe

One mornin fore the sun rise one mornin fore the light
One mornin fore the mean old rooster has cried
One mornin fore the trucks roll blowin their horn
We gonna take the whole world on by the storm

Someday Ill travel to the city
I might hop a trolley car
See them buildings tall as Everest
Disappearing in the stars

One mornin fore the sun rise one mornin fore the light
One mornin fore the mean old rooster has cried
One mornin fore the trucks roll blowin their horn
We gonna take the whole world on by the storm

We gonna take the whole world on by the storm
