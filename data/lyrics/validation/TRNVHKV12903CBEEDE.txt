Patience, understanding, loyalty

Got to have that old feelin' in your heart
That lets you know that love is about to start
But that's not gonna keep you together for very long
You need to think about what keeps love going strong

Patience, understanding, loyalty

I don't need to talk about the birds and the bees
'Cause you know they'll never set your mind at ease
Sugar is sweet and spice is nice when it comes to romance
But with true love you got to enhance

Patience, understanding, loyalty

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Not just talking about the love between boy and girl
I'm talking brotherly love, sisterly love, love comes in many ways
We can wrap about the situation all night long
But what it comes down to, is

Patience, understanding, loyalty

That's what love is made of
(Oh, that's what it is)
That's what love is made of
(That's what it's made of, yeah)

That's what love is made of
(Oh, that's what it is)
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
(Patience)

Ooh, that's what love is made of
(Understanding)
Ooh, that's what love is made of
(Loyalty)

Ooh, that's what love is made of
(That's what love is made of)
Ooh, that's what love is made of
(That's what love is made of)
Ooh, that's what love is made of
