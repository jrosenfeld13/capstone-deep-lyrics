In a dream I was
On a pony ride with you
You confessed your love
As the lovely night turned blue

Hey, baby, I la-laa-la-love you, too
Hey, baby, ooh, honey, hey, sugar
Level with me

Do you see a guy like me
And a girl like you
Shagging by the fire, whoo
On a honeymoon?

Because that could be reality
To you and me
If you just get what I got
Baby, that could be reality, eternally
If you just get what I got
And that is a frickin' lot

Baby, take me out
For a pony ride with you
And then later on
I will get your name tattooed

Hey, baby, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, so sweet
Hey, baby, ooh, honey, hey, sugar
I mean, seriously

Do you see a guy like me
And a girl like you
Shagging by the fire, whoo
On a honeymoon?

Because that could be reality
To you and me
If you just get what I got
Baby that could be reality, eternally
If you just get what I got
And that is a frickin' lot

Take me home
'Cause I like you

Tell me, do you see a guy like me
And a girl like you, aah
Shagging by the fire, whoo
On a honeymoon?

Because that could be reality
To you and me
If you just get what I got
Baby, that could be reality

What I'm sayin' is
I really like you a lot
