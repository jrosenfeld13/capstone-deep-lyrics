[Chorus:]
My heart is low, My heart is so low
As only a womans heart can be
As only a womans, as only a womans
As only a womans heart can know

The tears that drip
From my bewildered eyes
Taste of bittersweet romance
Youre still in my hopes
Youre still on my mind
A even though I manage on my own

[Chorus]

When restless eyes
Reveal my troubled soul
And memories flood my weary heart
I mourn for my dreams
I mourn for my wasted love
And while I know that Ill survive alone

[Chorus x2]
