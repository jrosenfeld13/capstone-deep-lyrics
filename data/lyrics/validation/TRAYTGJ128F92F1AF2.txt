When all you have is ignorance it's like screaming at a wall
The greed and the lies seem to be standing so tall
They say we'll change nothing, I will never give in
Keep fighting together we can win

My voice will be heard
Break down these walls of tyranny
Our voices will be heard
No difference between you and me

I will not live in society's restraints
It's time to set ourselves free from the hate
We weren't put here to live our lives enslaved
Problems everywhere it's time we make a change

OI! OI! OI! Together we shout

No difference, between you and me, keep fighting, together we shout
