I crave....
I wake up to shadows
Touching your pillows, looking for a trace of you smile
And that's when it hit me, you're no longer with me
In fact it's been quite a while
Since I sit here drinking coffee as you sipped your tea
And you swore you'd always love and always care for me
And even though there's no more else to save...
It's you I crave

Chorus:
I crave your touch
I crave your lips
I miss so much
The excitment of you kiss
But since your gone my heart won't behave
It's your love that I still crave

It may look like I'm happy but people who know me
Will know that I'm not doin so well
I heard you've been dating
And though I've been waiting
I had found you and no one else (???)
And just the thought of never waking up with you again
Always turns me inside out how could we let it end
And even though there's no more else to save (to save)
It's you I crave

[Chorus:]
I should have known
I should have seen
Because you were always there inside my every dream

Now that I will try
Love will never die
I think of you and I
Night and Day, though my mind knows
It's too late to say
Your love I crave

[Chorus:] repeat 2x
(crave for your touch, crave for your lips, since you've been gone my heart won't behave)

(Chorus until end)
(I crave for your touch, I crave for your lips, I'm missing you so much, I need your kiss, and since you been gone, my heart just won't behave...its your love that I still crave)
I crave your love love love.... Crave in the morning(fade out)
