[Verse 1]
When we met, always knew
I would feel that magic for you
On my mind constantly
In my arms is where you should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you in my life for all time

[Chorus]
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you

[Verse 2]
We stand side by side
'Til the storms of life pass us by
Light my life
Warm my heart
Say tonight will be just the start

[Pre-Chorus & Chorus until the song ends]
