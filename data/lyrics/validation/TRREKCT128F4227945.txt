Fear as friend I wish I'd never kissed;
Faded hand to mouth as catalyst
Technicolored static sender
Secondguess my love for danger
Bold-face it with a hand of 10 by 10
Turn the cooling card
And show your hand to me
Hands up, past time for both of us to see
Clothes and match were pulled straight from my bed
Fatal weather rolls around my head
Burned the place down to the ground now
And crazy head singed up this town;
Marked it with a blackened boldface T
Since I've got myself an easy job
Money passed behind and now I'm robbed
Sold away my rights forever
To something that was multi-splendored
I'll pass up the decision once again
