You blame your victims
You've got some nerve
You call them all insane
And yet you cause their pain
You lead them all on
I've watched you play
How do you sleep at night
As you play a sadist's game

I can see it in your eyes again
I can see it in your grin again
You're the Psycho
And you're the one who's sick

Your wicked ways will show
You want the kill
You only choose the weak
And you cut way too deep
The great imposter to all
And the greatest imposter to me
