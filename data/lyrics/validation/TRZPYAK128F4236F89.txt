You've got some kind of nerve
Coming back here for more
Like i'm just going drop everything i'm doing
So you can humiliate me a little more
You've got some kind of nerve

You got some kind of ego
Yeah for looking at me like that
Like your eyes are going to make me crawl back to you
Like what am I supposed to do now, just forgive you?

But baby i'm done
I'm done with you
Yeah baby i'm done
I'm finally done with you
So if you think that you might have made some sort of mistake
In leaving me
Well guess what
You're too late

You got some kind of mouth
For talking to me like that
Bragging about your Hollywood friends
Like that's going make me want you again
Makes me think you know that you never even knew me
Makes me understand
That the whole time it was you
Just using me

But baby i'm done
I'm done with you
Yeah baby i'm done
I'm finally done with you
So if you think that you might have made some sort of mistake
In leaving me
Well guess what
You're too late
I'm done with you
Yeah baby i'm done
I'm finally done with you
So if you think that you might have made some sort of mistake
In leaving me
Well guess what
Too late
Your too late
Your too late
Your too late
