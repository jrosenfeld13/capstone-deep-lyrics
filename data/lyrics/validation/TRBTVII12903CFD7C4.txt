Baby, you're driving my crazy
I said baby, you're driving my crazy
The way you turn me on
Then you shot me down
Well, tell me baby
Am I just your clown

Psycho!!

Baby, you're driving my crazy
I said I'm losing my mind
You treat me so unkind

Psycho!!

SOLO

Baby, you're driving my crazy
I'm going out of my head
Now I wish I was dead

Psycho!!

Baby, you're driving my crazy
I'm going out of my head
Now I wish I was dead

Psycho!! Psycho!! Psycho!! Psycho!!
