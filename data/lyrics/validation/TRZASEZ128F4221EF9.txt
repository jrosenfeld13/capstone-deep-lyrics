What's it like when all your dreams come true?
When your life is given something new
And you begin to live
The way you've always wanted to?

That, for me, is you

How did I become the lucky one?
Now, my time, my moment in the sun
And all because the faith you gave me
Finally pulled me through

That, for me

You, a cloud, a fantasy, a perfect chord, a reverie
All the gifts of life I see in you
And now I look upon my life
And can't believe the view

That, for me

So much more than I imagined
It could be

That, for me, is you
