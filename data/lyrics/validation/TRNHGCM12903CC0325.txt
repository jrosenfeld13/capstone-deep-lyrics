[Verse 1]
The children are sleeping
Our talk can begin
We've waited until they've gone to bed
We knew they would cry
When we said goodbye
And I'd rather leave quietly instead
We can never be happy
We both know it's true
We've quarrelled from the day that we met
Our love was too weak
To pull our dreams through
But too strong to let us forget

[Chorus]
I hope we can salvage a few memories
To carry us through the long night
The clock's striking midnight, yesterday's gone
And there's no tomorrow in sight

[Verse 2]
In our efforts to break through
The thick walls of pride
With harsh words that burned to the core
The wall's still remaining
But the words broke inside
And strengthened the walls even more

[Chorus]
I hope we can salvage a few memories
To carry us through the long night
The clock's striking midnight, yesterday's gone
And there's no tomorrow in sight
