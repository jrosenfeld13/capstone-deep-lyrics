Music: Lynch

You light a fire in the rain
And I feel it burnin'
You swore you'd never hurt again
I remember
Under the spell of a different role
A secret whispered
No one around to keep you home
The night is waiting

You can't resist it
When the darkness
Calls out your name
You keep insisting
That it's black or white
Show me tonight

Smoking candles light your way
They glow like angels
Words you just don't understand
That can change your future
It's too late to turn back now
Can you fight all your feelings
Frightened little girl you keep inside
But she's left in tears

You can't resist it
When the darkness
Calls out your name
You keep insisting
That it's black or white
Show me tonight

Well, there's two sides to living
Oh, it ain't always left or right
But you're only giving
What you're taking out of the night
