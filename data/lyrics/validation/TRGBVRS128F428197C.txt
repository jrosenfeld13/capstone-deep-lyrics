Sister, Sister, I don't feel well
Is there something wrong?
Are you just a junkie, too?
Too
Mother, mother, I don't feel well
Is there something wrong?
Are you just as crazy, too?
Too
Time and time again you'll think of me
As you spill my ashes on the floor
Time and time again you'll remember me
In this God forsaken town
I want to sleep with the stars
Die driving cars
Wanna make you happy
Just don't wanna die [2x]
Wanna make you happy
Just don't wanna die [4x]
