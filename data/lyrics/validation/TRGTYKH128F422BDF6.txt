[Verse 1]
They should have put her in the movies
My little country - cutie
She's the reason I believe god made blue jeans
I was a slicker from the city
When I met that little filly
I was six feet tall
Till she brought me to my knees
I sold my forgein car for a pick up truck
And have a drink Champgne
Now its jack straight up
When you better like Hank here
Or you rather love
What's up?

[Chorus 1]
She put the boy back in cowboy
And I was just a red necked wanna be
She put the boy back in cowboy
That southern woman made a new man out of me

[Verse 2]
The transformation was amazing
Even Jesus couldn't save me
Late at night I was such a sight to see
At the rodeo she kissed me
Then said"boy don't get too frisky
If you're lucky you might too step home with me"
Yeah I got the boots above
Was dancing high to get a big
I got a big belt buckle trying to rope a cow
For me the ring of fire is this cool as Johnny Cash

[Chorus 1][x4]
