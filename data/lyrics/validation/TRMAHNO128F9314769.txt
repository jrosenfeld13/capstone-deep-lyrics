Her back against the wall
She can't recede no more
There's nowhere to run
No place to retreat
Loosing self-control
Rage is taking over him
Feeding his short fuse with gasoline
Anger won't discriminate
She knows that they're all prey
When standing at close range
There's no way out
From this burning wreck
Paralysed by fear
She's too scared to escape
No way out
Trapped in this hell
A Sacrifice
No more strive
She now resignates
She had to take another strike
Right in front of her kids
Traumatized, victims of this hate
He's threatening once again
They better keep it sealed
Silence reigns, but pain never disappears
Confined with her family
Chained to her miser
An alliance she don't break
There's no way out
From this burning wreck
Paralysed by fear
She's too scared to escape
No way out
Trapped in this hell
A Sacrifice
No more strive
She now resignates
Her back against the wall
She can't recede no more
There's no place to retreat
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
