My girlhood among the outlaws was salty, bittersweet
The things I did, ah I could just kick myself now
Through nights of lousy dreams
As visions gather in my head
I find it hard to live with the things I did and said
But for you my friend, I'd live it all again
And love you in the end

Chorus:
Anything for you, baby, anything for you
If it took those years to get me here
I'd do it again for you

Took a leap of faith and I stumbled
Tried to live outside grace and I was humbled
But I'd like to bet if I lived to fear regret
Then we never would've met

Chorus

So here we are, and I don't know what we call it
'Cause love is such a funny promise
Commitment is impossible and forever is a lie
But that still leaves you and I

Chorus
