There is so much more than you think
Meanings rooted in the trees
Pulsing through the branches
Dispersing through the leaves
It's a beauty that will surely bring you to your knees

From city to city it runs, it sprints, it leaps
Through everything, through everything
Reds and yellows and blues and greens
Colours paint the sky. It's such a well done sky

There is so much more than you think
Meanings rooted in the trees
Pulsing through the branches
Dispersing through the leaves
It's a beauty that will surely bring you to your knees

But I'm weak and you're so strong
Let's not forget that I am weak and you are strong
So strong. Let's not forget

Yeah it's from city to city
It runs, it springs, it leaps through everything
Through everything, through everything
