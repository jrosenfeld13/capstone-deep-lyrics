I got the MC5, Suicide, Nancy Sinatra and Neil Young live
I got Heavenly, Peggy Lee, Captain Beefheart and the Vaselines

Driving down where the sun never sets
I got my jeans hiked real high and my songs on the cassette
Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting
Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting

I got 'Stephanie Says' and 'I'll Be There', Bikini Kill and the Marvelettes
Undertones, Rolling Stones, Sandra Bernhardt and Joey Ramone

Driving down where the sun never sets
I got my jeans hiked real high and my songs on the cassette
Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting
Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting

And I don't want this feeling to ever die
I wanna be with the shooting stars in the sky

Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting
Cos in the Summertime when the weather's fine
We go rollercoasting

Rollercoasting, rollercoasting
Rollercoasting, rollercoasting
Rollercoasting, rollercoasting
Rollercoasting, rollercoasting
Rollercoasting
