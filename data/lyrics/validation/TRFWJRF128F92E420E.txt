Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I get you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my world misty blue

Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good, baby
I think of the things we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue

Oh baby, I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried
Baby, when I said that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied, I've lied

Oh honey, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I get you off my mind
But I can't just the thought of you
My love, my whole world, it turns misty blue

Oh, oh I can't, oh I can't, oh I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh my love, my whole world turns misty blue
