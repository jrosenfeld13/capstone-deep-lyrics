Ooo, I may not drive a new Mercedes
But Ill chauffeur my girl, to the edge of the world
I may not wear a golden watch now
But Ill be right on time, for a woman so fine

I got love so pure
The object of my affection, thats her
She lives on the other side of town
And I know that her father doesnt want me hangin around
But Im gonna turn her whole world upside-down
If I make her mine, o mine, o mine
When I make her mine

She shops on rodeo drive
But I love that girl, yes I love that girl
And I know Im qualified, to love that the girl
Shes the only girl, in the whole wide world

I may not be a rich attorney
But Ill win my girls heart in a trail of love
I may not have the giant mansion
But Ill treat her so right, keep her warm at night

I got love so pure
The only woman that I want in the world is her
She lives on the other side of town
And I know that her father doesnt want me hangin around
But Im gonna turn her whole world upside-down
If I make her mine, o mine, o mine
When I make her mine

Oooh, Im gonna make her mine, o mine, o mine
Im gonna make her mine
