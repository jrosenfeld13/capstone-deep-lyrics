Tell me now what have you done
To justify your life my son
Did you help your brothers, when they were down
And when the bullets flew, did you stick around

I had no words, I never spoke
If I had said one thing, you wouldn't know
I did no harm, I hurt no one
Why you ask me now, my chance has gone

Please don't send me away
I want to come in
If you give me today
I will try again

Child I gave you all the breaks
But all you did was take and take
You say you did no harm, but you did no good
And never sought redemption
I think you should
I realise my selfish love
Has always got me through, by just enough
I never thought this day would come
When the demons of my soul would be undone

Look up and see the angels
The gates have opened up for you
I hope your mind is peaceful
And love is everything you do
