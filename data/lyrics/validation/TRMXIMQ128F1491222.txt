Tear the world in two
And choose a half
But look inside you
You are what you are
I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too

Know yourself
And teach yourself to crawl
Into the hole
Exploding in your thoughts
I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too

I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too
You tear the world in two
I'll destroy you
