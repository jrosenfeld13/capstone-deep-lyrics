[Verse 1]
I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is aching
Lord, my mind is breaking
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog named Rover

[Chorus]
Got to keep on moving
Got to keep on moving
To understand both sides of the sky
You got to keep on grooving yeah
Good grooving
Because you got your God and so do I

[Verse 2]
We got to keep on loving
Good, good, good, loving
Make love on my dying bed
We got to stop smoking, stop, stop
I mean cigarette smoking
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you baby
I wouldn't even have the breath

[Chorus]
