Black or white?
We look at what we were
Whether wrong or right
No one can tell

Whatever it takes
The reason to believe you
I won't let go
Holding onto innocent meaning

Sunset boulevard
Don't fade away
Let's take a walk in the dark

Sunset boulevard
Let's make believe
All that matters was written in your heart
