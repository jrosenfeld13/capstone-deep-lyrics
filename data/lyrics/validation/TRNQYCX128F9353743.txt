There are many who have laid with me
Then got up and walked away from me
And played around with me like I was a game
Every night was a one night fling
When I'd given them everything
They never even asked me for my name
God they never even asked me for my name

Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it
So if you love me
The way I love you
Why can't we spend our lives as one

My reputation was all over town
As a woman who was passed around
I knew every wrong way to go
Seen every room with a bed inside it
And every habit I've tried, I tried it
But from now on I say hell no
No but from now on I say hell no

Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it
So if you love me
The way I love you
Why can't we spend our lives as one
Why can't we spend our lives as one
