For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say "Good night" until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know

(instrumental interlude)

So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know
