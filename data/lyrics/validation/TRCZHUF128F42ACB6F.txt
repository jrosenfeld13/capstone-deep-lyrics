When you were young
You always thought you'd be a star
Even when you washed the glasses in that bar
But since you've been recognised
Your modesty's been paralysed
Your looking through Gilmour's eyes

In a starfit
Nothing cuts the mustard in a starfit
Your p's and q's are busted
And you don't give a damn
About the every fan
Who puts the coinage in your starfit

And when it's done
What will become of all that pride?
The washed out stares
Lay bare the care that cracks inside
You are nothing more than you were before
You're just a played out bore

Having a starfit
Nothing cuts the mustard in a starfit
Your p's and q's are busted
And you don't give a damn
You're waiting for the man
To put a plaster on your starfit

But since you've been recognised
Your modesty's been paralysed
You're looking through Garbo's eyes
