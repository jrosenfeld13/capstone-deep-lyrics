Now ten years later I'm thinking for you
I think for the times we had together
I love you and hate you, wanna meet you next days
And don't want to see you anyway

I know 'bout your hair, I know about your lips
I don't know how's your mind and how are your rips
Returning my thougts I realize
That you were, you were, oh you were my life

Grey green are the streets, grey green my heart
That's why I came back to see you once more
And 'cause I know I need you more than death
I love you, and hate you, and love you, and hate you so

I know about your hair, I know about your lips
I don't know how's your mind and how are your rips
Returning my thougts I realize
That you were, you were, you were my life

Grey green are the streets, grey green my heart
That's why I came back to see you once more
'cause I know I need you more
More than death, I need you so

You were still going with me
Just like the rat following to the water
When I'm arriving here I go
I love you, and need you, and need you, need you so

Now ten years later I'm thinking for you
I think for the times we had together
And now I hate you, wanna meet you next days
And don't want to see you anyway

I'm coming

Now ten years later I'm thinking for you
I think for the times we had together
I love you, I hate you, wanna meet you next days
And don't want to see you any-, anyways
