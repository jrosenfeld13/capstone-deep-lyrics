[Verse 1]
I want to write you a poem
That stands the test of all time
A couplet, a quatrain, a ballad, an ode
With meter and rhythm and rhyme
I wanted to speak of your virtue
Sing praise to your statute and poise
I wanted to capture your beauty
The soul that's alive in your voice
I wanted to tell of your wisdom
How the courage within your heart soars
But all I can think of is how I be loving
Them big, big, big titties of yours!

[Hook 1]
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, how my heart sings
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, love those thing

[Verse 2]
They bounce like a kid on a trampoline
They swing like a '40's jazz band
They stand up like a rock solid alibi
They don't even fit in my hands
They curve like a pitch in the big leagues
They burn with a passion so hot
And that is the reason I can't wait to squeeze
Them big, big, big titties you've got!

[Hook 2]
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, love's in the air
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, what a pair

[Verse 3]
Oh, I need to need them
Like sculptors need clay
They dance in my dreams
In a graceful ballet
I'll kiss them so sweetly
Goodnight at the end of the day
They're firm like a John Grisham novel
They swell like a wave in the sea
No matter what part of the room that I'm in
They're always looking at me
They're soft like the cheek of a baby
They're sweet like the honey of bees
I'll never ignore them, I'll even adore them
Someday when they're touching your knees!

[Hook 3]
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, what a rack
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, hurt your back
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, on my knees
Oh, Oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, double D's
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, glory be
Oh, oh, hallelujah!
Oh, oh, set them free
