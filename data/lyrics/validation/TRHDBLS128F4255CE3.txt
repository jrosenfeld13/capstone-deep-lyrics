(Roger Taylor)
Come on, come on
She was a waitress she looked real fine
The little temptress was so divine
A symphony of cheap perfume and pretty stale red wine
She can wait upon my table any time
She was poetry in motion
Stiletto heels and nylons she moved up to the table
I could see she had for me a burger with my fries on
Love lies bleeding, hey listen to this,love lies bleeding
Well we parked outside a city bank
We found it all real funny
The car was running on full tanks and we stole all the money
She was a wicked wily waitress and she should be doing time
She was an ordinary waitress now she owns her own goldmine
How 'bout that,love lies bleeding
Now listen to this,love lies bleeding
She was a rebel without a cause
She was a girl who needed applause
Love in the future love in the past
Love in the future love in the past (love lies bleeding)
Love lies bleeding in our path (love lies bleeding)
Would you believe that it gets worse (love lies bleeding)
She had a loud theatrical whisper
I had a one way ticket to Palookaville
She had an equally dangerous sister
I was out of my league they were in for the kill
She was a wicked wily waitress and I gave her all my trust
She took the loot gave me the boot
Now she's rich and I'm flat bust
Yeah (love lies bleeding)
Now that was the limit (love lies bleeding)
Because
She was a rebel without a cause (love love)
She was a girl who needed applause (love love)
Love in the future love in the past
Love in the future love in the past
Love lies bleeding in our path (love love love lies bleeding)
I dreamed this world was quite alright (love lies bleeding)
And everyone meant well (love lies bleeding)
When I awoke to my surprise (love lies bleeding)
I found myself in hell (love lies bleeding)
Love lies bleeding...
