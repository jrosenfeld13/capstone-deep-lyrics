[Bridge]
I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mixed-race girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls, and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls, I like them blonde haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bitty weight girls

[Verse 1]
Now baby I've got a lot of love to give
And I've been over, oversubscribed with relationships
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure

[Hook]
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

[Verse 2]
Now maybe I can learn to settle down one day
But right now I'm livin' life to mess around and play
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure, I did it before

[Hook]
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

[Bridge]
I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mixed-race girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls, and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls, I like them blonde haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bitty weight girls

[Hook]
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
