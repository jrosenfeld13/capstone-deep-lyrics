Through madness and sorrow
Walking hell for a mile
I vow to myself
I'll always look back and smile
When inside I'm burning
This can always be said
Here and now I stand with my
Head held high 'til I'm dead
I won't
Take
More
Madness and Sorrow

Back to the wall
Feeling hell in my head
Holding a hand
Of the devil's own deck
Deal back the cards
And now I'll take my turn
Throw back three sixes and watch the world burn

There's a malignant feeling
That's born in my head
With all this black inertia
Could we be seen as dead
Through the storms and the battles
Of my life I have found
My primal born instinct is never to
Be held down
I won't
Take
More
Madness and Sorrow

Back to the wall
Feeling hell in my head
Holding a hand
Of the devil's own deck
Deal back the cards
And now I'll take my turn
Throw back three sixes and watch the world burn
