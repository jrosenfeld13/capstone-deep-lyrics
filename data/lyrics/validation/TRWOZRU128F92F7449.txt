Tonight I let loose the dove
In futile hopes of its return
Watch bleeding feathers and flags unfurl
Free with the breeze that burns me
I know that I pushed you to fall apart
These eyes are blackened now to what is real
Someday I'll touch you with my heart
This prosthetic heart has broken itself
Torn in string and letting loose all it had
This shell can only contain its screams for so long
Blackened brow, blood as oil to burn
Boiling over to fuel this loss
These eyes are black and blue and imprinted with you face
An image I will never forget
Today I will staple myself back together
With black hair stitches I will be whole again
And on that day the madman will raise his eyes
Staring at me with a tear and a laugh
The oldest of phrases falls from his parted lips...
"I told you so..."
