We spend eight hours on the road
Just to put up a shitty show
Few appreciate
We play our set and go...

To where ever it is
That we're gonna stay tonight

And now that the tension is gone
We laugh at our mistakes
Let go of the breaks
Have a few bears and relax

Let go of the breaks
Have a few bears with our friens

We bring some friends and our gear in the van
That's why were always too late
Lucifer doesn't go too fast
And we're not always feeling so great

5 cups of coffee, 1 or 2 beers
Then I'm in shape for an intense shit-break
Before I can go up on stage
Before I can go up on stage

Coffee drinking
Always stinking
Still brings out
The best in me
The smelly farts
The crapy jokes
The stomacheases, headaches the laughs and the........
