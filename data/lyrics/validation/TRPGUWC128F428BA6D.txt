Born in the month of June
No silver spoon to help you out
Your Mother had you naturally
Naturally's the way you came out

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes
To the wonders that you see

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

For the love that's been given you
Is the one thing time can't erase
And evryday it's growin'
Like the knowin' smile upon your face

You're startin' out strong
You get a kick out of life
You like to sing songs
Be in the spotlight
And when everybody's watchin' you
You shine so bright

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes
To the wonders that you see

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world
