[Intro]
(9's down to the bricks)
(9's down to the bricks)
(9's down to the bricks)
(9's down to the bricks)

[Verse 1]
I saw algebra in your eyes
Geometry between the lies
I saw my image of you fade
In exponential waves of gray

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I'll go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I know
I should have figured it

[Chorus]
Don't give me degrees
I've been at the seaport all day long
Just me and my paint box abstracting numbers in the sun
Good-bye bye bye
In long division

[Verse 2]
I saw my image of you fade
In exponential waves of gray
I saw my favorite number two
Get crushed, divided in squares

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I'll go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I know
I should have figured it

[Outro]
Don't give me degrees
I've been at the seaport all day long
Just me and my paint box abstracting numbers in the sun
Good-bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
In long division
