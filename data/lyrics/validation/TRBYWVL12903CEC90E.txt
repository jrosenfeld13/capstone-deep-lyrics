Distant voices, calling my name
Echoes from the past
Are haunting me
Different believes, erasing time
I'm watching a world
Of blood red skies

Fading memories, leaves no doubt
There's a purpose to this life
TIll death comes along
Screamin' of anger
As the sun disappear
Hear my prayer as I say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Seasons will change
Heed is the wonder
Now you are mine
To shores of this night
Embracing Fear

Darkened Shadows
Coming over me
There where sun was
Now there's only rain
Holy spirit, save my soul
When I'm staring into
The devils eyes

[Chorus]
I see the world through
MY third eye
A clear vision of it all
Staring at past lives
Now rise!
Come rise again
I see the demon in your eyes
In the shadows of this stage

[Chorus]
