We can be
We can be
We can be more than ever people
More than ever people
More than ever people

Wake up you lazy people
Put on your heads and realize
We can be positive people
Adjust your attitude and rise

We can be
We can be
We can be more than ever people
More than ever people
More than ever people

Beyond lust and desire
Cut free and individualize
The colors of your power
Let love come shining through your eyes

We can be
We can be
We can be more than ever people
More than ever people
More than ever people

Wake up you breadhead people
This time's so in control of you
Such an only time for money
When will you see the real truth?

We can be
We can be
We can be more than ever people
More than ever people
More than ever people
