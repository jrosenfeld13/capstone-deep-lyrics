Youve been cryin
Your face is a mess
Come in baby
You can dry the tears on my dress
Shes hurt you again
I can tell
Oh, I know that look so well

Dont be shy
Youve been here before
Pull your shoes off, lie down
And I will lock the door

And no-one has to know
Youve come here again
Darling it will be
Like its always been before
Come on over here

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You dont have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said
Ain't no need

Whats your hurry?
Please dont eat and run
You can let her wait, my darling
Its been so long
Since Ive had you here
You will come again
Darling it will be
Like its always been before
Hey child

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You dont have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You dont have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said, yeah
