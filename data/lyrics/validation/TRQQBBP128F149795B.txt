Walking off alone with your back to the one you said you loved. Stepping out of skin we grew together in as never ending, but you ended it. Unprepared for the hardened coldness. I could not detect it in your eyes. And ever moment that I had to give was dedicated by your side. Of all the nights we held each other dear, never did I dream your grip would end. And your breath against my neck I fear was my only reason for breathing. I will always miss you. According to the facts so casually you lay before me, off your interest died. I'm nodding with your head just to agree and going against what I know in mine. I need a promise not a prediction on when this well resolve. Ok. If it is never then at least I know. I'll go without my dignity and say I will always miss you. I am a skeleton on display
