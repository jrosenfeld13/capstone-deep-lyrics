We were young
No one could figure out
Things we said
There was so much to laugh about

Now at the end of the day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Just last night
I couldn't sleep at all
Lost my mind
Lost my footing scaling the wall

Now at the break of day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Now at the end of the day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Now at the end of the day
Wish you would say
And the race is on again

What am I doing now?
What am I doing now?
What am I doing wrong?

Will you wait for me?
Or will you run away?
I swear that I knew yesterday
Yesterday

What am I doing now?
What am I doing wrong?

Will you wait for me?
Or will you run away?
I swear that I knew yesterday
Yesterday
