Unleash the sickness...
Infecting the soul which will now depart
Unearth the forsaken... dimming the glare of eternal light
Only to be erased by the awaiting devastation
May his name be remembered no more
Predestined existence... their eyes bleed the lies divine
Imperious deception... admonish those who made you bleed
Foresee the coming of retribution...
Prepare them for the day of slaughter
Let them hate... so long as they fear
As they did of us... for so many years
Complete voraciousness... towards the will of man
Through the hours of our pre-eminence
The words of god we shall blame
Disembowel the souls to be released into the void
Their essence now ordained
Torrents of fury
Begin the process of deconstruction
The obedient wait
As their structure of life begins to decay
From the inside out
Upon knees and hands
Drain the sanctity from their veins
Drowning from the pain
The end of existence... devour the land from end to end
His gates are ablaze... devour the palace of peace
My words and my will shall be law... till death
Through the hours of our pre-eminence
The words of god we shall blame
Disembowel the souls to be released into the void
Their essence now ordained
Let them hate... so long as they fear
As they did of us... for so many years
Complete voraciousness... towards the will of man
Predestined existence... their eyes bleed the lies divine
Imperious deception... admonish those who made you bleed
Foresee the coming of retribution...
Prepare them for the day of slaughter
Torrents of fury
Begin the process of deconstruction
The obedient wait
As their structure of life begins to decay
From the inside out
Upon knees and hands
Drain the sanctity from their veins
Drowning from the pain
Unleash the sickness...
Infecting the soul which will now depart
Unearth the forsaken... dimming the glare of eternal light
Only to be erased by the awaiting devastation
May his name be remembered no more
The end of existence... devour the palace of peace
My words and my will shall be law... till death
Watch as their faith begins to disintegrate
