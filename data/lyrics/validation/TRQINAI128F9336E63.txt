In this life torn apart
I've been looking for the answers
I wish i was at home
If i could end this all today
If i could only find away
Say you'll keep a candle burning
Cause i'll be coming home

I dont wanna run away
I dont wanna sacrifice
Say you'll be here with me
You could give me the strength to carry on
I dont wanna run away
I've been running way too long
When you're here with me
Something hits me
I know that we belong
In this life

All this time i've been gone
You were always waiting for me
I need to let you know
If i could take the pain away
If i could find the words to say
Say you'll keep a candle burning
Cause i'll be heading home

I dont wanna run away
I dont wanna sacrifice
Say you'll be here with me
You could give me the strength to carry on
I dont wanna run away
I've been running way too long
When you're here with me
Something hits me
I know that we belong
In this life

I waited all the moments
I waited all along
My arms are there to hold you
Im coming home tonight

I've been away for far too long
The memories have kept me strong
You're the one, the one that got me through

I dont wanna run away
I dont wanna sacrifice
Say you'll be here with me
You could give me the strength to carry on
I dont wanna run away
I've been running way too long
When you're here with me
Something hits me
I know that we belong
In this life

I dont wanna run away
I dont wanna sacrifice
Say you'll be here with me
You could give me the strength to carry on
In this life
I dont wanna run away
I've been running way too long
When you're here with me
Something hits me
I know that we belong
In this life
