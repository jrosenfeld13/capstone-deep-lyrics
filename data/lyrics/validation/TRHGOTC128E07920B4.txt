[Verse 1: Jo]
When the world leaves you feeling blue
You can count on me, I will be there for you

[Bradley]
When it seems all your hopes and dreams
Are a million miles away, I will re-assure you

[Pre-Chorus: All]
We've got to all stick together
Good friends are there for each other
Never ever forget that I've got you
And you've got me so...

[Chorus: All]
Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach up for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

[Verse 2: Jon]
There's a place, waiting just for you
It's a special place, where your dreams all come true
Fly away, swim the ocean blue
Drive that open road, leave the past behind you

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Don't stop, gotta keep moving
Your hopes, gotta keep building
Never, ever forget that I've got you
And you've got me so...

[Chorus: All]
Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach up for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

[Bridge: Paul]
Don't believe in all that you've been told
The sky's the limit you can reach your goal
No one knows just what the future holds
There ain't nothing you can't be
There's a whole world at your feet

[Jo + All]
I said (reach)
Climb every mountain (reach)
Reach for the moon (reach)
Follow that rainbow
And your dreams will all come true

[Chorus: All]
Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach up for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true
Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach up for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
(Shining, shining, shining)
That's when your dreams will all come true
(Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach up for the stars)
