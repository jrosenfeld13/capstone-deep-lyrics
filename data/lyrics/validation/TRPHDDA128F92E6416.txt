I would like everyone to be innocent
I don't wanna know how to get this nonsense

If all of us do the right - why the fuck is all wrong?
Nothing is gone, nothing is gone!

Accumulating, dreaming, waiting, cheating, spilling a little bit later
What you ever thought about now doesn't matter
What you gonna do is not gonna make you better

Living with the fact that everybody is wicked sinner
Winner of the war is also loser not the winner (get this nonsense)
Inner, my inner hurts, inside I feel black birds trying to show my turds

You're just a liar who admit no reality
All your good moves is just scaring of gravity

I want everybody to be innocent
I don't wanna know how to get this nonsense
I want everybody to be innocent
I don't wanna know how to get this nonsense

I would like to be innocent
Would like to get this word
I would like to be innocent in the world of sins

Redemption is as easy as always
There are many things worth to do, get your own ways
At good days heart says:
"Don't offend weak person, help get sin erased"

Ask yourself do you know
What is direction your wind blows or no
What is the right side and what side is wrong
Feel it to be with people, not alone

You'll never get truth
If you think a lot what behavior to choose
You'll die with no friends
If you never get how the concrete action offends

Now you go to figure out how to act
How to be the benefactor's part

I want everybody to be innocent
I don't wanna know how to get this nonsense
I want everybody to be innocent
I don't wanna know how to get this nonsense

No sense!

*Suprise, mothefucker*

No sense!

Winner of the war is also loser
Winner of the war is also loser
Why the fuck is all wrong, nothing is gone
Winner of the war is also loser
Loser! Winner of the war is also loser
