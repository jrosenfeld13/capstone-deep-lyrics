You caught me out when you caught me wondering
Just what it is I see in your face
Are you like me, are you feeling out of place?

You say the world is a shapeless mystery
Some kind of maze that you cannot break
So many roads but you don't know which to take

Just close your eyes and put it from your mind
Forget the time and the life we leave
We can escape, we can break out tonight
Just close your eyes and slip away with me

From overhead they're trying to get to us
Cutting their slice, bigger every day
What we can make is the best of what remains

Give me the chance and I'll try to prove to you
Though all this strangeness is running wild
We can break out, we can lose this for a while

Just close your eyes and put it from your mind
Forget the time and the life we leave
We can escape, we can break out tonight
Just close your eyes and slip away with me

The hard part of this life takes up far too much time
Why waste the rest wondering why?
Tonight we can change it, tonight we can kiss it goodbye
Leave it all far behind, behind

Just close your eyes and put it from your mind
Forget the time and the life we leave
We can escape, we can break out tonight
Just close your eyes and slip away with me

Just close your eyes
Close your eyes
Just close your eyes
Close your eyes...
