100 mile high city
Falling to the floor
Everybody's in it
Falling to the floor

Will i ever find some peace of mind
Ever in the world

Baby he's a crying
On his mother's knee
Bankers they are lying
Dealt us to our knees

Will we ever find some peace of mind
Ever please

Take us to the doctor
But the doctor makes mistakes
Take us to the lawyers
But the lawyers over paid
Take you anywhere
Where you can show your face to the world

100 mile high city
Falling to the floor
Everybody's in it
Falling to the floor

Will i ever find some peace again
Ever in the world

Baby he's a screaming
Paper's they're agreeing
I can see no reason
Should be screaming treason

Will we ever find no peace of mind
Ever in the world

Take us to the doctor
But the doctor makes mistakes
Take us to the lawyer
But the lawyers over paid
Take us anywhere
Where you can show your face to the world
