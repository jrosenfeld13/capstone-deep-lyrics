I aw your wild dancing shadow in the rain
A new world and my heart was drenched in champagne
The stars were shining
And the earth smelt sweet
Your footsteps in the sand
That sand touched my feet

You move me
Your the object of my desire
You move me
My spiritual satisfier
You move me
With a kisses burning like fire
You take me higher and higher and higher

You take me higher and higher and higher

And no one possesses you
Just like a sea
And no one can get down to you but me
You entered my aura
And fell into my arms
I just wrapped around you like a snake
That's been charmed yeah

You move me
Your the object of my desire
You move me
My spiritual satisfier
You move me
With a kisses burning like fire
You take me higher and higher and higher
You take me higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

My mouth are wet with your love
(With your love)
My eyes are blinded with your face
An image I can't erase

You move me
You move me
You move me
An image I can't erase
You move me
I can't erase

You move me
