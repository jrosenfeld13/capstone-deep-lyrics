You'll never find me
You'll never find me
I am going away
You'll never stop me
You'll never stop me
From my self decay

I've tried to warn you
You never listened
Now it's a little too late
You'll never find me
You'll never find me
I am going away

I'll slowly drown
'til my head hangs down
'til I come around again
Around again

You can't define me
You can't define me
Your eyes are filled with doubt
You can't remind me
So don't confine me
I'll find a way out

I'll slowly drown
'til it all dries out
'til I come around again
Around again

Don't come around here, no
Don't come around here, no
Don't come around here, no
Just let me go, go go
Don't come around here, no
Don't come around here, no
Don't come around here, no
Just let me go, go go

(Don't come around here, no
Don't make us leave here, no
Don't come around here, no.)

I'll slowly drown
'til my head hangs down
'til I come around again

Oh
I won't be found
'til it all dries out
'til I come around again
Around again

You'll never find me, no
You can't define me, no
You'll never stop me, no
Just let me go, go, go
Let me go, go, go
