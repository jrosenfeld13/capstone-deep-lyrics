Must have been out of my mind
Must have been a little bit crazy
I had heaven in my hands and didn't even know to do with it
Must have been seeing things
I can't believe the tears in my eyes
And now all I want to do is tell you what you mean to me

Never been one for crying
Don't waste time on jealousy
Never even thought about holding on till it happened to me, yes it happened to me

Chorus
That's not me
Don't look like me
Don't walk like me when you're out together
That's not me
Dont act the same way
Ain't got the same thing
He don't love you like I do

I must have been driving too hard
Doing ninety in a thirty-five zone
And now everything I do
Designed to get you back to me
You know, walking through stone
Breathing under water
Is easier than trying to shake a memory

Never been one for crying
Don't waste time on jealousy
Never even thought about holding on till it happened to me, yes it happened to me

Repeat Chorus
