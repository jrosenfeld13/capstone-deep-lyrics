I should have known right from the start
You never understood the feeling in my heart
I thought you were just afraid or maybe just naive and so

I let myself believe again
I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe you've gone away

I should have learnt from times before
Why can't I stop myself from coming back for more?
I fall too fast, I say too much, my heart is on my sleeve and then

I let myself believe again
I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
Though I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe

The signs are always there as they were with you
And still I did what I always do

I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
Though I swore I'd never do this, go though this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe you've gone away
