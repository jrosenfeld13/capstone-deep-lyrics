The weight of my words is not enough
To make up for the words I didn't say
I'm sorry - close the door
Just afraid to suffocate
Inside this these arms I'll find comfort
I will try not to break another mirror
Because that would be that I only break myself
My eyes have never felt so sore - if I had only known more
Self centered - myself to blame - death is fucking you insane

A selfish boy with fear and doubt afraid to let it inside
I promised myself that I wouldn't break it another time
No questions asked through all the time - just answers taken
My guilt - my thoughts - my mind
Where - who's to judge?
I think I need to breath - let the door be open
The only one who is choking me is myself
Why can't I see that you are the sun - the rain - the fuel I need inside
Why can't I see? I will try

I won't listen - I will cry - sunflower princess
I won't listen - I will cry - sunflower princess
I won't listen - I will cry - sunflower princess
I won't listen - I will cry - sunflower princess
