Hope that you'll illuminate along the way
Convinced that all the ends run down so furiously
I'll leave this unconvincing voice upon the air outside
I'll leave it on the air
I'll leave it on the air outside
Rationalize, deny, defend all the way
And it's been set and rendered still away from view
I'll leave this unconvincing voice upon the air outside
I'll leave it on the air
I'll leave it on the air outside Rationalize, deny, defend all the way
You knocked those years right out of me
This calling, so sound asleep
