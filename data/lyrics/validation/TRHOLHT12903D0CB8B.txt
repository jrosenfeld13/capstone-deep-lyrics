Jamaica Funk - that's what it is
Let it get into you
C'mon I've got a groove ... you know where I 'll be...
Funkin for Jamaica ...
If ya feel it ...let it get into you
Jamaica funk that's what it is
Let it get into you

I feel it ... inside my soul
Let it get into you
Cause there's enough to go all the way around
Let it get into you ... let it fill you up inside
This feelin's funk that's what it is
Let it get into you

And I let it get into me..
Jamaica funk that's what it was ...
Let it get into you...
That feelin's funk that's what it was ...
And I let it get into me -- I let it get into me
Woa woa woa this feelin's funk ...that's what it is
Baby come funk wit me ...
