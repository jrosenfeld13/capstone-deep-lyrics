Guess I'm just a victim, girl
Victim of society
I guess I'm just a character
At least that's what the people think
(That's what they think)
I'm just a victim, girl
(He's just a victim)
Victim of life today
(Society)
I'm just a character
(You've got the character)
At least that's what the people say
(That's what they say)
Eyes of expectations, girl
Look beyond reality just to be original
Doesn't come so easily
(Not easily)
I'm just a victim, girl
(He's just a victim)
Victim of life today
(Society)
I'm just a character
(You've got the character)
At least that's what the people say
(That's what they say)
Guess you'd call it image, girl
Or maybe personality
I guess you'd call it character
Wanted by society
Maybe what you're seeing is a bit of grandiosity on my part
Or maybe it's just an image of what you'd like for me to be
I'm not sure but if it works for you then it works for me
I'm just a victim, girl
(He's just a victim)
Scared to fall in love
(Society)
I'm just a character
(You've got the character)
The character, open eyes and scared of love
(Scared of love, scared of love, scared of love, scared of love)
