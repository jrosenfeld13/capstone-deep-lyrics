I've got a very simple philosophy
It seldom stands me in good stead
But even though there are some who agree
It is the right way let is spread:

It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe, to believe

Somebody told me they saw Mary Jane
Walkin' with a guy she loved before she met me
And you might ask would I trust her again
And my reply would certainly be:

It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe, to believe

It's better to believe what you know the situation ought to be
It's better to believe than to go on findin' faults in everyone you see
Who you see

And so my simple philosophy
Points at the politician and the soldier's gun
And I would say that the world might be
A safer place without suspicion

It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe and be wrong
Than to suspect and be right
It's better to believe, to believe

It's better to believe, to believe
It's better to believe, to believe
