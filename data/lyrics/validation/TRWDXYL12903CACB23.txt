[Verse 1]
All of your crying will do you no good
Stand up and straighten yourself
Just one of your moods
I'm selling the family now
To the highest bidder
Structures come crumbling down
Blessing the bruise

[Chorus]
Take cover, run
As fast as you can
Fast as you can
Against the wind
It's all over, so long
Blood on your hands
Blood on your hands
I am alive

[Verse 2]
It's easy to forget your heart when
Leaving behind
How dare you compare your pain with
The look in her eyes
Hey, aren't you proud of me now?
I'm still calling
Surface to surface of lies
You kept in the dark

[Chorus]
Take cover, run
As fast as you can
Fast as you can
Against the wind
It's all over, so long
Blood on your hands
Blood on your hands
I am alive

[Bridge]
Because of you
The solitude of love can feel so sore
Blood above your door
Because of you
The solitude of love can feel so sore
Blood above your door

[Chorus]
Take cover, run
As fast as you can
Fast as you can
Against the wind
It's all over, so long
Blood on your hands
Blood on your hands
I am alive

[Outro]
Polyrhythm, come together for an eyesore
Blood above your door
Polyrhythm, come together for an eyesore
Blood above your door
Polyrhythm, come together for an eyesore
Blood above your door
