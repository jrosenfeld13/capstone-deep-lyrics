Woman you know you got to be crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Or something tell me you just might be losing your mind

Oh you make me think you're crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, woman
Seem like to me darling you may be losing your mind

The way you been acting lately baby, lord
Oh, you're 'bout to go drive me out of my mind

You know I sit in a dark room, yes
My tears rollin' down my eyes
Oh, you know you make me sit in a dark room
With the tears rollin' down from my eyes

You know I can hear my little girl say
Oh, my father is a hurt child

Oh, when I leave I'm goin' back south
People, where the weather you know they suit my clothes, wow

You know I think I move back south
You know where the weather, you know that good weather sure suits my clothes

You know I've been here in Chicago so long
But in last two winters man you know I've almost froze

You know it snowed in Chicago
'Till I could hardly see myself, he he

Oh, you know it snowed in Chicago
'Till I can walk down the streets you know and I couldn't see myself

Well you know I was tryin' to find my baby
You know she was right over, right over snowin' with somebody else
