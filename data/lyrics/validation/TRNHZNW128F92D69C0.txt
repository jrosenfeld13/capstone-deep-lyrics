Cut some new lines in your palms with the night like you own it and don't trip
Burn what you've learned in the black hole and wait for the winter to split

I know, I know, we could go, we could go
Climb up the towers
I know, I know, we could go, we could go
Play with the powers

Cut some new lines in your palms with the night like you own it and don't trip
Burn what you've learned in the black hole and wait for the winter to split

I know, I know, we could go, we could go
Turn time into trouble
I know, I know, we could go, we could go
Try to see double

Cut those new lines in your palms with the night like you own it and don't trip
Burn what you've learned in the black hole and wait for the winter to split

I know, I know, we could go, we could go
M-I-S-S-I-N-G
I know, I know, you could go, you could go
M-I-S-S-I-N-G
