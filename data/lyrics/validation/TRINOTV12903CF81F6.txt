[Intro]
I bleed for my dreams
In a place that I come from
No
No
This time it's true, this sweat's for you

[Verse 1]
Make it stop with just one move
(Make it stop with just one move)
Pity those with a soft hand
Making smaller cuts on softest of fabric

[Chorus]
We all know what it's like when we
Put it out in front of us or go home

[Verse 2]
And now watch him bleed, stomach turns
Let's keep this time rolling where it counts
Baby, I know that I've tried
As desperate, it seems that I'm high
From watching you fail
My heart's for you
My heart's for you

[Breakdown]
Breathe in deep
His mind is slipping
Farther side of the room
His feet are planted
His gaze shifts to you
Can it be enough?
Will it be enough?

[Verse 3]
Now stop the pain at the deepest cut
He's inside damaging our pride
We've driven this road too many times before
With no exit

[Outro]
We all know what it's like when we lose hope
Put it out in front of us or go, go home
Put it out in front of us or go home
Or go home
