Arise, arise and follow me
As best you can
Come follow me, my measured dance
Come see my circus, come dice with chance
Now you are come beneath my sway
Who once was as the daylight gay
Here's rights, here's wrongs
And reasons why
A time to live
A time to die

I was your slave, now you are mine
I am Time, I am Time

Experience will teach you what you may
And what you may not do
I'll teach you to forget the truths
You always knew
See what might be
See what might have been
Though you yourself created me
Your own mistake has set me free

I was your slave, now you are mine
I am Time, I am Time
