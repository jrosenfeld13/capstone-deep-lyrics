When I was a little girl
I never thought much of this world
Like why the night was night and day was day
But my mama always made me feel so happy
And I always would start to smile
When I heard her say

You've got to love to last
If you really want to make it
And there'll always be someone there to help you sing
Go on and love to last
All you got to do is try it
And you'll find you have all the strength you really need

When I grew a little bigger
That's when I begin to figure out
What made me different from my friends
And I found it wasn't something on the outside
It was the happiness in my heart I felt within

You've got to love to last
If you wanna keep on growing
And it's really not hard to do once you start
Come on and love to last
And your sunshine will be glowing
And they'll see all the love and joy
That's in your heart

I wanna be free to love and free to live
Like the seasons that pass you by from year to year
I want to sing every song to music that I hear
And let the melody linger on within my ear

Come on and love to last
You just put your whole heart to it
And you know that we all can do it
Everyone
Everyone
We're gonna lead every woman
Every man
It's gonna take everyone around to free this land

Come on and love to last
We can take away all troubles
We can burst all the bad luck bubbles one by one
Come on and love to last
You can put your whole heart to it
And you know that we all can do it
Everyone
Everyone
Everyone, yeah

We must love on
And love on
And love on
