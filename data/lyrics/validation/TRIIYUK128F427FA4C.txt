You don't know what's right anymore
You think your love is just a score
Are you too young or afraid to grow up?
You can work this out if you both try
It's hard to cheat but harder to lie
Is this what you want or just a passing thought?

Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide

Ask yourself "what for?
What for, what for, what for?"

You painted a picture she wanted to see
You can laugh this one off but it's not funny
She's given you everything she has
Oh oh

Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide

Ask yourself, "what for?
What for, what for, what for?"

You wanted her and you got her
But you're still so careless with your words
If you let her go, she'll move on
Find someone, she's never coming back
How can you live with that?

Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide
So you should think about it some more

Ask yourself, "what for?"
(I know it sounds like the same old line)
What for?
(I know it seems like the same old guy)
What for?
(Maybe I don't know how to treat you right)
What for?
(Maybe you'll meet someone to know your life)
What for?
(You said I lied since the day we met)
What for?
(But I meant every word I said)
What for?
(Someday you'll miss every single day we spent)
What for?
