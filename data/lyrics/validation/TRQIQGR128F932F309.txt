If you need a sensual space
Inside your world
That you feel safe
I'll meet you there
Uh...i'm hiding
It's safe in here
Uh...i'm hiding
Uh...i'm hiding
I feel safe in here
Why i'm here?
It's dark it's cold
I miss your life
In my silent world
Uh...i'm hiding (why am i hiding?)
It's safe in here (i feel so scared of you)
Uh...i'm hiding (why am i running?)
Uh...i'm hiding (you scare me)
Show me a place
To be in me
Close inside
I'm breathing new
Uh...i'm hiding
I feel safe in here
Uh...i'm hiding (why am i hiding?)
I feel safe in here (why do i run from you?)
Uh...i'm hiding (why do you scare me?)
Uh...i'm hiding (you know i care for you)
Uh...i'm hiding (oh i keep hiding)
Uh...i'm hiding (i keep on running away)
Uh...i'm hiding (i keep on running)
Uh...i'm hiding
It feels warm
It feels strong
Safe from here
I belong
Deep inside
Where i can't hide
Oh you feel....
Uh la la la.....
