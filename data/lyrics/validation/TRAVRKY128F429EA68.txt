One Holy Ghost
For a homemade girl
In a green T-shirt
That read, I quote:
"What price? Damnation now."

In the school of thought
In the halls of state
With a leap of faith
The loose translation
Must have lost her
It must have caused her

To go back to the civilization
Caught between here and the real one
Just to say what you'd begun to say once

We have been enrolled
In the wrong schools all
Through the pride of fall
The falling price of education now

There have been no clues
In the last few takes
In the steps retraced
The education
Must have cost her
It must have caused her

To go back to the civilization
Caught between here and the real one
Just to say what you'd begun to say once

The education must have cost her

The loose translation must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah
The loose translation must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah
It must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah
