Loving time my love is gone
Cannot carry on
Feel it's getting into my mind
Feel our hearts getting stronger
Feel our minds getting longer
All the loving time I've spent with you
Loving time is when you're here
Feel it when you're here
Feel like getting into my mind
Feel our hearts getting stronger
It's getting a whole lot longer
All the loving time you've spent with me
I see a picture up on the wall
Painted with red and with green
Face in that picture keeps calling me
Never seen a face that's so serene
Never, oh oh
Never seen a face that's so serene, yeah, yeah, hey
Loving time my love is gone now
Feel I cannot carry on, oh
Feel I got to get it together in my mind
Feel our hearts getting longer
Feel our hearts getting a whole longer stronger
All the loving time you've spent with me
Loving time is when you're here
I feel it, guess you're here
I've got to get you into my mind
Feel our hearts getting stronger
Getting easier and whole lot longer
All the loving time I know you've spent with me
Because I can't help myself
I'm slip slipping away, oh oh oh
