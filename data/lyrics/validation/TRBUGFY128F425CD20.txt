Hmmmm, ohhh, ohhh
I am leaving this place now
Letting go of all my fears
Saying goodbye to the memories I hold dear

I can finally breath again
Its a new day, farewell past
As I close this chapter I set free at last
And I say
I made up my mind there's no turning back
The past is behind me theres no turning back
I'm looking forward not behind
I've made the decision I give you my life
