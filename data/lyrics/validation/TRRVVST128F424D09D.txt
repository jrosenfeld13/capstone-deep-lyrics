A sudden wave of chaos, then momentary silence
Reflections of demons haunting my conscience
It's all a self-inflicted illusion

Humiliation - Never forgotten
Put under - Strict control
Our lives running like sand through an hourglass
Society turned upside down, a world filled with shattered dreams

Future seems to hold, a black hole conatining
Hopelessness and disbelief
There is nothing real, outside my perseption of reality
Invoking the unborn truth

Humiliation - Never forgotten
Put unde - Strict control
The philosophy of putting perilous memories into oblivion
The depths of my subconsiousness is playing with my mind

Hate is the mirror of envy
Confidence breeds suspicion
Hate is the mirror of envy
Confidence breeds suspicion

A sudden wave of chaos, then momentary silence
Reflections of demons haunting my conscience
It's all a self-inflicted illusion

Hate is the mirror of envy

[1st lead: Ideberg: 2nd Lead: Malmstrom]

Humilaition - never forgotten, put under - strict control
A complex transformation into a hostil phantasm
Infected by halluinogen atmospheres controlling the flesh
