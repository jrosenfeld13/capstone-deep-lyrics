I'm not man or machine
I'm just something in between
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
I'm all love, a dynamo
So push the button and let me go
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa

You want me to come alive
Flick the switch into overdrive
You and me can let it be
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire

Touch that dial
Turn me on
Start me like a motor
Make me run
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it, c'mon

I got fun, you want some
I'm ever ready, Dr. Love
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
I'm antenna, aerial
I'm tunin' in, I'm outta control
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa

You got love, you got a deal
You wanna drive then take the wheel
You and me can let it be
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire

Touch that dial
Turn me on
Start me like a motor
Make me run
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it, all right

Oh, you want me to come alive
So flick the switch into overdrive
You and me can let it be
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire

Touch that dial
Turn me on
Start me like a motor
Make me run
(Lovin')
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

C'mon and touch that dial
Turn me on
Start me like a motor
Make me run
Turn that dial all the way
Shoot me like a rocket into space
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
