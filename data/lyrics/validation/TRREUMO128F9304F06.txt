I want to love (Love you)
I want some lovin' from you
I want to love (Love you)
And no one else's will do
To give me lovin' (Lovin')
The kind that's right
Be my lovin' baby tonight

I want to kiss (Kiss you)
I want some kissin' from you
I want to kiss (Kiss you)
I'll always be true
I want to kiss (Kiss you)
And hold you so tight
Be my lovin' baby tonight

Last night ?  waiting
And baby, tomorrow you'll moan
You're so fine and fascinating
Baby, I'm not made of stone

I want to love (Love you)
I want some lovin' from you
I want to love (Love you)
And no one else's will do
To give me lovin' (Lovin')
The kind that's right
Be my lovin' baby tonight

[Instrumental]

Don't keep the future waiting
Baby, tomorrow you'll moan
You're so fine fascinating
Baby, I'm not made of stone

I want to love (Love you)
I want some lovin' from you
I want to love (Love you)
And no one else's can do
To give me lovin' (Lovin')
The kind that's right
Be my lovin' baby tonight
Be my lovin' baby tonight
Be my lovin' baby tonight
Be my lovin' baby tonight
Be my lovin' baby tonight
