Sometimes we only live for the here and now
Sometimes we're lonely
Sometimes we feel we need a place to be grounded
Or fly away again

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again

Why are we feeling something's familiar around us?
Are we just dreaming?
Always we search for the answers but nothing is found
We'll fly away again

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again

I feel rain pouring down
I wait to run away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

Run away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

I feel rain pouring down
I wait to rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

Run away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

It never ends

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again
