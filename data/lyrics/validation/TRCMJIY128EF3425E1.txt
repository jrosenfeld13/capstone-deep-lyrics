Well an old saying goes mind your manners, mind your mother
And a man can find a lover who is tan and undercover
Well she might lie about her age, but lady I got no
Complaints

Well she can be as crazy and as foolish as she wants to be
Because her old school ways are practical
Technicalities are perfectly sane
I'm saying I ain't never seen a saint

I met her at an old cop bar down in silverlake
Where we joked about the give and we joked about the take
And when they asked for identification I knew her's probably
Was a fake

She's just another older lover undercover
She's just another old-school lover undercover

She's wearing that thin disguise, don't apologize
'Cause your birthday suit suits you
Ooh, well it suits me too. It's one hell of a costume
I can't find the zipper anywhere on your back
Perhaps it's attached to the breach of your ass-crack

Burr, it's cold in here
But you keep it hot, dear

Well, I sip mexican coffee and grapefruit juice
Glass coke, glass of wine just to keep it loose

Oh the things that you say and do, yeah
Or the way that you groove to the music
I like the Who and the Velvet Underground old sounds
Like indie rock, spock rock, anything you've found
In the backseat of your downtown brown, bruised beat up BMW

I said you're down with the downtown
Down. I dig the old sounds
Down with the old lady, now

You're just another older lover. And you're undercover
Are you wearing that thin disguise? Don't apologize
Your birthday suits you
Oh, well it suits me, too. It's one hell of a costume
I can't find the zipper anywhere on your back
Perthaps it's attached to the breach of your ass-crack

Any melodramatic role is just a garment of the soul
I respect your nakedness and the way that you unfold
And the way the story's told
You're just another older lover

And you're undercover
