This song is addressed to my sisters
Any man who is present may listen
Any priest, any public official, any physician
But it gives him no license to touch us
We make the decision
Me and Lydia, Josie and Rosie and Eve
We handle this matter ourselves
You'd better believe, or you better leave

Chorus:
Rosie Jane, are you pregnant again?
Rosie Jane, you can hardly take care
Of the four you had before
What in heaven's name were you thinking of!
Rosie Jane, was it love?

I had an extra shot on top of what I'd got
In a word I was drunk, so was Bill
At least I think it was Bill
And I'd forgot to take my pill
I guess it was God's will

(Chorus)
When that baby is a child
It will suffer from neglect
Be picked upon and pecked
And run over and wrecked
And its head will be crowned with the thorn
But while it's inside her
It must remain intact
And it cannot be murdered till it's born

(Chorus)
