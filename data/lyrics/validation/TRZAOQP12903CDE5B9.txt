Yeah yeah. Ooooh. You know its gonna be alright)
Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I'm
Ready Ready Ready
(Coming for the knockout baby!)
Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I'm
Ready Ready Ready
Mother said there'd be days like this
She never said how bad the nights could get
I entered the corner the same way I exit
I can't quit now got too much invested
Obstacles in place in my face
Don't get greedy maintain steady pace
Trying to spray my 3rd eye with mace
I gotta keep my people close just in case
If you gonna hold me down 'cos I'm coming for the crown
I'm gonna stand my ground and be the best pound for pound
Cos I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready
If there has to be a fight then I'm ready
I'm gonna bring it any way I gotta swing it
The powers that be prove the evil that men do
Some times you gotta fight just because they sent you
I want World War 3 on hunger
Keep my focus get ready to rumble
Each month is a round in the fight of my life
Its me against the whole world but I'm ready for the fight
If you gonna hold me down 'cos I'm coming for the crown
I'm gonna stand my ground and be the best pound for pound
If you gonna hold me down 'cos I'm coming for the crown
I'm gonna stand my ground and do this pound for pound
Cos I'm
Ready Ready Ready Yes I'm
Ready Ready Ready
Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready
Y'know its gonna be alright
Watch me not stop though!
(I will succeed! I will overcome! Get ready for number one!)
Coming for the knockout baby!
If you gonna hold me down 'cos I'm coming for the crown
I'm gonna stand my ground and be the best pound for pound.Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight yes I'm
Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I'm
