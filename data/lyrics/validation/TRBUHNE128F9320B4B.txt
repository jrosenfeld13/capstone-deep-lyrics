Black Crows on the blue sky
Always making a mess
And I wake in the morning tangled up in their nest
They're laughing from phone lines
Stealing dreams from my head
It's time to get up now
And I've been long left for dead

Some days are better than most
When nobody comes and nobody goes
There's songbirds up in a row
I'll put in my dime and sing to your ghost

They're singing the same songs
And wearing the same old clothes
Driving the same drive
But always driving too slow
And you bring me back here
But it's not where I should go
I'm killing time every morning
Cursing at the same black crows

Cause some days are better than most
When nobody comes and nobody goes
There's songbirds up in a row
I'll put in my dime and sing to your ghost

You turned bad I know
It was your mama that told me so
But I still love to see you come
And I hate to see you go

Some days are better than most
When nobody comes and nobody goes
There's songbirds up in a row
I'll put in my dime and I'll sing to your ghost
