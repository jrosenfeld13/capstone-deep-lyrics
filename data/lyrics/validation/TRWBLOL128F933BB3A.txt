If I ruled the world
Every day would be the first day of spring
Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man and the moon has, when the moon beams

(piano solo)

If i ruled the world
Every man would see the world was his friend. Yeah
There'd be happiness that no man could end
No my friend, not if i ruled the world

Every hand would be held up high
There'd be sunshine in everyones sky
If the day ever dawned
Will i rule the world

Every hand would be held up high
Every star would shine in everyones sky
If the day ever dawned
Will i rule the world
