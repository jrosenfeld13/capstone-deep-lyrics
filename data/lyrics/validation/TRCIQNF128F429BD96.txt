You really had yourself a fling all night parties everything
People say you're really quite a girl
But when you fall in love at last your future will be in the past
And I wouldn't miss it for the world
You always leave a broken heart you kiss and run away
Your little world will fall apart and that will be the day
You're gonna need a certain guy and be left settin' high and dry
And I wouldn't miss it for the world

You think that people's hearts are play that you can twist 'em any way
You're gonna be a very lonely girl
They'll jerk that carpet neath your feet a broken heart is your reseat
And I wouldn't miss it for the world
You'll meet someone who'll put you in your place
I want to be around to see that look upon your face
He'll be gone and you'll remain then your teardrops fall like rain
And I wouldn't miss it for the world

You'll meet someone...
