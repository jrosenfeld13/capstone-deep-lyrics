Fuck
And when no ears are there to hear
We reach into our empty shells
This is the hole I've dug for us, these plots are where we will sleep forever
I buried myself with your last goodbye

This is an anthem for the broken
Struggle to stand as they push us back to our knees
Pulling for the strength to lift our heads reaching for the promise
Bending to make an escape to the air below

Now it's the fear that keeps us frozen
It's the apathy that holds me here

We bid farewell to the futures we will never find, An apology never mouthed. The earth, the sky, they follow us there
