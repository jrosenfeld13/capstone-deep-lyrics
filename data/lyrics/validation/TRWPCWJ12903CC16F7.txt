[Verse 1]
Original master, architect, intel
-lect, respect, my heart full of splinters
Agitating, so frustrating
Letting dreams stay as dreams, what are you waiting
For? Feel the score, deep in your center
Immaculate is the conception enter
My dragon ways, for so many days
I rode on a ship with a hull full of slaves
A foreign land, foreign mind, foreign time
A foreign design to keep my people blind, I'm
A rebel in a system that don't give a {fuck}
Where CEO's feed your death to earn a buck
And people get stuck, following the trends
Of a TV generation, but where does it end?
You can say amen but you really got to feel it
Then every time you see a snake, you'll reveal it

[Hook]
It seem like everybody trippin', or is it me?
Bein normal nowadays, it'll drive you crazy
Go to work 9 to 5 everyday, no retreat
You got to have a dollar just to get somethin' to eat
It seem like everybody trippin', or is it I?
Crazy lady walkin around shoutin' curses at the sky
Instrumentals be the lullaby, rhyme stimuli
Now come along and vibe as we praise most high, you be trippin'
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?

[Verse 2]
Now in this rap consortium there's a whole colosseum
Of fake rap cats who tax human beings
Just a microcosm of a larger macro-problem
I sit with my pen and pad, imagine ways to solve 'em
You can call me a dreamer but I do not need a Beamer
To validate existence, I'm blessed in every instance
False pretense is what angers me the most
I'm good at counter attacks, don't try to play me close
Don't toke toast, just roast with my rhythm
And give 'em a hundred percent of what I'm livin'
If it seemed like suicide, God must've lied
When he told me he will die on the road that I fly
Keepin' me high, rockin' 'till the day that I die
If I told y'all people once, they got no rest in the sky
Why is you trippin? why is you trippin?

[Hook]
It seem like everybody trippin', or is it me?
Bein normal nowadays, it'll drive you crazy
Go to work 9 to 5 everyday, no retreat
You got to have a dollar just to get somethin' to eat
It seem like everybody trippin', or is it I?
Crazy lady walkin around shoutin' curses at the sky
Instrumentals be the lullaby, rhyme stimuli
Now come along and vibe as we praise most high, you be trippin'
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?

[Verse 3]
Most of us settle for less which really ain't fresh
I travel east to west to chart progress
I found the common denominator to always be stressed
And make me loose my breath to think about the death
That happened when we rapping but we just keep clapping
I pause for a second
Respect to the dead
And let it enter in your head
Too many things on my brain in this wicked game
TV, fear, pain will leave you stained
Welcome to the other side they said it never rained
You'll never win a game where the rules always change
First a college degree, now a Ph.D
But if you got black skin you need at least about three
Combat, in the illest blessing it, verbally
With the solar energy to let the people be free
Because we, are their seed yo

[Hook]
It seem like everybody trippin', or is it me?
Bein normal nowadays, it'll drive you crazy

It seem like everybody trippin', or is it I?
Crazy lady walkin around shoutin' curses at the sky
Instrumentals be the lullaby, rhyme stimuli
Now come along and vibe as we praise most high, you be trippin'
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?
Why is you trippin', why is you trippin, why is you trippin'?
