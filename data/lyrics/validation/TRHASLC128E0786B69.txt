I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes
Living far beyond my means
Do you know how that feels?
I was waiting for so long
I was praying to belong
Only holding out to see and believing
There's only one strong enough
And hard enough to give you away

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside
Saying I, I want to let you go
Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you
Long enough will give you away

There was never one as I
Who could stand the reasons why
Who would even take the time
Did you care, was I right?
Only once did you try
Even then it was hard enough
Just for you to realize or believe
There was only one strong enough
Or hard enough to give you away

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside
Saying I, I want to let you go
Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you
Long enough will give you away

In this big area

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside
Saying I, I want to let you go
Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you
Long enough will give you away

Sometimes you break me up inside
In this big area of life
Saying I, I wnat to let you go
Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you
Long enough will give you away

I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes
Breaking down
Something so right and so fine
