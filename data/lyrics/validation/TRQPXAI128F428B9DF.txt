These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same
These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same

He was a simple man with a simple life
Two twin kids from his former wife
To himself he was already dead
Before he put that gun to his head

The selfish motherfucker, what gave him the right?
The phone felt like lead on that deadly night
When my friend got the call
There was no happy ever after after all

These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same
These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same

It's been 3 years and things still ain't the same
His stomach still tightens at the sound of his name
Still looking back to that funeral day
And the echoes of voices saying everything's ok

You can't understand the anger and hate
That comes to you when you've been given this fate
Don't tell him he was a wonderful man
How dare you look at him and say you understand

These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same
These deadly nights, we need someone to blame
These deadly nights, things will never be the same
