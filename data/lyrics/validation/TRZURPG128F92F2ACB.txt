6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
"Hey Daisy rise and shine"
He pours two bowls full of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
"The bus is here, we love you mom"

He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, "I love you dad"
Daddy says it right back
"Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you, and Daisy, and your mom
I'm so proud of you son."

He's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta to be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's 6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
