[Verse 1]
Your soft hand
But I don't understand
Your big brown eyes
With a small small heart

[Chorus]
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk walk walk away

[Verse 2]
Take me
I will remember you
Long dark hair
Nothing much to lose

[Chorus]
Help you crawl crawl crawl
Oh, I want to see it all
Eyes asked why why why, too late

[Verse 3]
Please you
Oh, I know what to do
A soft salt taste
Do you see me as a fool

[Chorus]
Can I look look look
Oh, the things you took
Eyes asked why why why, too late
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk walk walk away
