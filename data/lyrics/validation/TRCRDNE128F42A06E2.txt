They say that there's a hole in the atmosphere
The things you think will last disappear
When you were ready to say I do
Somebody lowered the boom on you
Now you need a sympathetic ear

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it

Love isn't always true it hurts sometimes
Your tears will tell on you girl, I'm not blind
I know what you're goin' through
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it

You took a lesson in playin' a fool
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it
