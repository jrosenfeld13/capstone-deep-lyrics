[Verse 1]
Baby
When I think about you
All I wanna do
Is be by your side
Take a little ride
Baby
Oh, you know I'm all about you
And all I wanna do
Is take a little ride
Maybe get inside

[Chorus]
Mama told me boy someday that girl will take your mind
And then you'll know
I never knew, but I do now
I never knew, but I do now
I love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, you, you, you, you, you
Mama told me boy someday that girl's gon' take your mind
And then you'll know
I never knew, but I do now
I never knew, but I do now
I love you, love you, love you, love you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
Sour as my fingers dirty pick pocket
I can still taste you and I won't wash my hands
Red is the color of the sun with my eyes closed
I can still taste you and I will again

[Refrain]
Dark little place she digs to go
Dark little place she digs to go

[Chorus 2]
Woman please, please
I'm in your possession
Down, drink it, wanna drink it
Drink it, drink it
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Refrain]
Dark little place she digs to go
Dark little place she digs to go
Dark little place she digs to go
Dark little place she digs to go

[Chorus 1]
Mama told me boy someday that girl's gon' take your mind
And then you'll know
I never knew, but I do now
I never knew, but I do now
I love you, love you, love you, love you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus 2]
Woman, please, I am your possession
And you are my obsession
What we gon' do now?
What you gon' do now?
Where you going?
Reel me, reel me, reel me in
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus 1]
Mama told me boy someday that girl gon' steal your mind
And then you'll know
I never knew, but I do now
I never knew, but I do now
Dark little place she lets me go
Dark little place she lets me go

[Bridge]
Red is the color of the sun with my eyes closed
I can still taste you and I will again
