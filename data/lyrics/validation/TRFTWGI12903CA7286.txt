Is it time to throw away our memories
Photographs and relics
Of what used to be
Is it time to start again

Another life, another name
Oh, does it have to end?
I always felt save with you

[Chorus]
Do the best adventures have to end
Now do we leave the scene as friends
Is this how I'll find love and trust
From being so alone

Alone and lost
Is this where we say goodbye
Rather than just live another lie
Does it have to end?
I always felt safe with you

[Chorus]
There is a silence in our heartaches
The cry of the unknown
It's like a bird that can't be heard
Is it really time to go?

Is it time to throw away our memories
Photographs and relics
Of what used to be
Is it time to start again

Another life, another name
Oh, does it have to end?
I always felt save with you

[Chorus]
