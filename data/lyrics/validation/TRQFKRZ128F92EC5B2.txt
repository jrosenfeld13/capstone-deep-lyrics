Good night, good night....
Look at that moon shine so bright
And tonight he smiles
Especially for you

Sleep tight, sleep tight
Know everything is alright
And tonight I will be here
Watching over you

For tonight I will be here watching over you
Tonight I'll be here watching over you

Sweet dreams, sweet dreams
It is never as real as it seems
And in the morning when you wake up
I will be right here

Sleep on, sleep on
For no matter how dark or how long
It may seem that your night is
I will still be here

I will still be here watching, watching over you
So sleep, little darling, sleep on through

So be still, be still
For you know that I always will
Tonight and forever
Be watching over you

For tonight and forever, be watching over you
So sleep, little darling, sleep on through

I will be watching over you
