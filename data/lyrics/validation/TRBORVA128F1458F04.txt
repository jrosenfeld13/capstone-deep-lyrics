Remember the time when you thought too much and I told you what to think
You don't think that way, that's all right by me
The sun was beating, defeating, repeating and all the time I wanted to know your face
And not your name for a while

Well, your mama's gone and your papa's dead and I need to be beside your head
For a week or two, maybe three
And your hair in front of your sunglassed eyes reminds me of a time
When I knew my place, my size for a while

Running in the night without a light, got to go, got a gun, got a wife right by me
Running in the night without a light, got to go, got a gun, got a wife right by me

Your current form of insecure leaves me standing out for more
I tried my best to pass your test
And for a while I forced a smile, I know it wasn't much
But anything's enough for you

I don't want to wait, anticipate, celebrate before I hate
I think I like you
And if it's only for a while, I'll see if I can force a smile
For you if not for me

Running in the night without a light, got to go, got a gun, got a wife right by me
Running in the night without a light, got to go, got a gun, got a wife right by me

Wait for a while, see how it goes
Have you been to the bruised arcade ?
You know it's ever, ever making me blind
The sun's in my eyes, it's telling me lies
And, God, you're a long time following
Wait for a while

.......
Sun sun sun sun sun is in my eyes
Sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun

The sun's in my eyes and it's making me blind

The sun's in my eyes and it's making me blind
The sun's in my eyes and it's making me blind

The sun, the sun is in my eyes
The sun, the sun is in my eyes
