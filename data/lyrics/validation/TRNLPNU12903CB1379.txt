Well, the knot says I'm gone
Could it be, could it be, could it be
I watch my patients getting sick on you

This must be hell
This must be hell
But it is only me

I watch you drowning in
The circulation of the happy sea

Electric water
Holy water
This is the last disease
That I wash from my hands
Empty hands of you

You know it's true
No time to stay
You know it's sick six minutes from eternity

Wait, no time to pray
What could God say

No bells in hell
Ringing for you
Ringing

Oh, will you take my blood cocoon
Could you please, could you please, could you please
It must lie somewhere out its phase

This must be hell
This must be hell
But it will never be

I want to drown it in the
Circulation of the happy sea

Electric water
Holy water
This is the last disease
That I wash from my hands
Empty hands of you

You know it's true
No time to stay
You know it's sick six minutes from eternity

Wait, no time to pray
What could God say

No bells in hell
Ringing for you
Ringing

This bitch is hard to kill
This bitch is hard to kill

This bitch is hard to slay
This bitch is bitching all the way
