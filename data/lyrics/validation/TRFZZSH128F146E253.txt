Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh

[Verse 1:]
It's my birthday and he forgot again
Every time we date
He's always late
Tired of abuses and excuses
I've made up my mind
Gonna tell him this time
We're through, yeah

[Hook:]
But everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time
I see his face
My eyes light up
Sparks start to flying

[Chorus:]
Cause he's a live wire
A real live wire
He's like a bolt of lightning
That sets my soul afire

[Verse 2:]
Sweet kisses are his ali
And that's
That's where my weakness lies

Though I plan and rehearse
Things I want to say
The words never
Never come my way

[Hook:]
Cause everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time
I see his face
My eyes light up
Sparks start to flying

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

Yeah
Live wire
My eyes light up
Yeah
