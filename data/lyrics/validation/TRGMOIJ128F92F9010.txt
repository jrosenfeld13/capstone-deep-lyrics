In Storyville I fucked a cop
Amped up on prescription pills
That brought my heart to a stop
And I want to tell you there's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters

I met a girl on the square
Who showed me how to kill my cares
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Time's running backwards for me and you

There's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
My body's running, but I don't see why it bothers

Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
Who'd never close both his eyes
But one was shut all the time
To cover the thing he was scared of
While he watched with the other

There was a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters

There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming
