[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

More than sweet words, a stream of emotions
Then around everything disappear
Hands are cold, tough the breath
In a moment you possess my desire

Somewhere I'll meet your eyes again
Under the rays of the moon
You'll be mine, babe

Desire, my dreams caress you
But I can't wait for laying
Togheter, living what seems to take a shape

More than meet the eyes
I look at my empty arms
I pretend you're close to my heart
Suddenly I realize maybe you're feeling the same
Yeah, such a disarmed stare never lies

Somewhere I'll meet your eyes again
Under the rays of the moon
You will be mine, babe

In the night I need you here
In the heart of this night, it grows from my heart
...deep from my heart, it's screaming

Desire, my lips are on you but I can't stand I'm just
Forever, chasing what seems to fade away
