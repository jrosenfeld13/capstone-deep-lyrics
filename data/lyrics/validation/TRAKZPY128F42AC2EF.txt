[Verse 1:]
Well' you never buy me flowers
Hey, did you hear what I said
I'll be dancing barefoot while you put the kids to bed
Take a good look darlin
At the smile on my face
It's been a long hard week and I'm ready to play
Now take a big whiff honey
Of my sweet perfume
Well, it's the only thing left of me left in this room

[Chorus:]
Cause' I'm alright now
Got a little money
And the gas taks full
Yeah, I'm alright now
Me and the girls in the Coupe DeVille
Yeah, I'm alright
Daddy's doin dishes
Cause it's momma'a night out

[Verse 2:]
Well you can be a couch potatoe
Drink your beer and eat some chips
While I put a little Wet-N-Wild on my lips
So take a picture of me honey
Cause I look so fine
You got yours and I got mine

[Chorus][x2]

[Chorus]
