[Intro]
Something, something just ain't right
Make it last forever
I'll give all my love to you
Merry go round and round
Keep it coming
How do you like it when I do it just like this
Got me twisted over you
Who can love you like me? (Nobody)
My body all over your body
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (Girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
Play
