I Woke Up Kinda Feelin' Bright
My Stomach Filled With Butterflies
My Dream Was All Bout' A Love Affair
It Was Beautiful Cause You Were The One Right There

I Look Up Just To Check The Time
Cause You Bounce From Work After 5
I Know Your J-O-Be Hard On You
So I Wanna Scoop You Up And Tell You What I Wanna Do

Take You On A Ride, Like A Rollercoaster
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...
Have You Feelin' Right, Getting' Kinda Vocal
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...

All Day, I Was Fantasizing
Can't Say Much, Cause Some Of It's Classified
Till Tonite When We Both Will Share
In The Moment When You Tell Me Just To Hold It Right There

When You Talk, You're Deeper Than An Ocean
A Woman, With Complex Emotions
Just Love To Peel Off All Your Layers
You Got So Many Delicious Flavors

Satisfactions, Waitin' For Ya', You'll Relax Like, You're Supposed Ta'
When I Finally Put My Hands To You, I Blow Your Mind With Some Thangs You Never Knew
Hope You're Not Working, Real Late Cause, All This Talk Got Me, So Anxious
Can't Wait To Play In Your Amusement Park, We're Gonna Sway And Whoa Into The Dark....

Take You On A Ride, Like A Rollercoaster
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...
Have You Feelin' Right, Getting' Kinda Vocal
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...
