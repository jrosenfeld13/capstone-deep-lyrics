[Verse 1]
Goddamn for the sake of something
We do it for the brain that you shake your rump with
And I would say its a safe assumption
That it ain't worth sayin if youre sayin nothin
We keep it on the floor so your feet dont stop
While I check out the time on the Free Gold Watch
Open it up cause we dont need no locks
And we bringing the ruckus so the sheep dont flock
To the old man tryin to wonder where the times gone
Will he let bygones be bygones?
Im in the back no putting all of my song
On a brick wall with a Fat Cap Krylon
The hope is youd chalk it up to show biz
He had a mission in life but lost focus
And now hes hanging by a rope where the throat is
Hes a martyr for the super-fresh-dope-kids

Yall know the shinny T-shirt
Fluorescent throwback sneakers
No substance in that meter
Get that bullshit out my speaker

[Hook]
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
On Friday night
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
When the vibe is right

[Verse 2]
You talk like it ain't some real shit
Right now
Like you wouldnt get a bundle to you lip
Right now
You deserve everything you get
Right now
Matter of fact you actin like a real bitch
Right now
So sit right down
And vibe to the mayhem and bedlam
Riot from Beantown to Belgium
Peace out to brethren
We now defend them
Educate planet when I run up in the Kremlin
Meanwhile the Red Orchestra plays and plays
The same finger-pointing symphony for days and days
You wonder wheres Exposite?
Chillin with Charlemagne on the Champ Elyse?
Sipping Sauvignon Blanc with some mademoiselle?
Under Arc De Triumph like Im Bonaparte?
HEY
I love it when you sing that song
I dont even know the words but Im singing along like

Ain't nobody looking for a self described
Man made marionette in this life
Love is murder and suicide
Believed by one, then two, then five

[Hook]
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
On Friday night
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
When the vibe is right

Young man from the university pays for the A-E-I-O-Us
But he cant survive
On the textbook jive
So he stakes his tide with you
And he said

Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
On Friday night
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Stay alive and fight

Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
On Friday night
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
Dont Be Sheep
When the vibe is right

That shinny string you hold
Lets you know just whose in control
Dont change
Do not let go
Everything new will soon be old
Their rules, their wrongs, their rights
My grind, struggle and fight
It all put me here tonight
To say THIS MUSIC SAVED MY LIFE
