[Intro]
Fade in, start the scene
Enter beautiful girl
But things are not what they seem
As we stand at the edge of the world

[Verse 1]
"Excuse me, sir
But I have plans to die tonight
Oh, and you are directly in my way
And I bet you're gonna say it's not right"
My reply:
"Excuse me, miss
But do you have the slightest clue
Of exactly what you just said to me
And exactly who you're talking to?"
She said, "I don't care, you don't even know me"
I said, "I know but I'd like to change that soon, hopefully"

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all flirt with the tiniest notion
Of self conclusion in one simplified motion
You see the trick is that you're never supposed to act on it
No matter how unbearable this misery gets

[Verse 2]
"You make it sound so easy to be alive
But tell me, how am I supposed to seize this day
When everything inside of me has died?"
My reply:
"Trust me, girl
I know your legs are pleading to leap
But I offer you this easy choice
Instead of dying, living with me"
She said, "Are you crazy? You don't even know me."
I said, "I know, but I'd like to change that soon hopefully"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I would be lying if I said that things would never get rough
And all this cliche motivation, it could never be enough
I could stand here all night trying to convince you
But what good would that do?
My offer stands, and you must choose

[Verse 3]
"Alright, you win, but I only give you one night
To prove yourself to be better than my attempt at flight
I swear to God, if you hurt me, I will leap
I will toss myself from these very cliffs
And you'll never see it coming"
"Settle, precious, I know what you're going through
Just ten minutes before you got here, I was gonna jump too"

[Chorus]
