Kathi tells me that she doesn't care and its not as if she's dumb or unaware
Kathi tells me there's no reason why but she doesn't feel that eating meat applies
Kathi says she doesn't understand why I do not want to eat at Burger King

And I try (I try), I can see that it makes no sense
'Cause I try (I try), I can see the difference
And it's something that I felt in side that will remain there
Something that I can't hide

Kathi tells me everything must die but I don't get what she implies
I think about the things she has to say all the time, I don't see how she can close her eyes
'Cause it makes me sick to think of every cage and it makes me sick to think of life wasting away

And I try (I try), I can see that it makes no sense
'Cause I try (I try), I can see her innocence
And it's something that I felt inside that will remain there
Something that I can't hide

Kathi says a lot of thiNgs but it all has that familiar ring
Kathi says a lot of things and it all has that familiar ring
