[Verse 1]
Why do I put myself through this
Why do I even try to make it work
When I know this ain't gone change
Why do I keep on coming back
When I know that this is wack
What am I going to do?
I am so addicted to you girl

[Bridge]
(What should I do?)
When leaving you is not an option babe
(Am I a fool)
When I know that where this is headed babe
(This isn't new)
Weather I stay or weather I go I just go with the flow
Cause there's no turning back,there's no turning back

[Chorus]
I must like having you hurt me
Girl and i knew we was done right from the start
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
Cause I just can't seem to leave you alone

[Verse Two]
Just because something looks good don't mean it's good for you
And that's the honest truth, yeah my mama told me that
One minute everything is cool
Then the next time hating you
Something's wrong with that
Yeah I can't be without you girl

[Bridge]
(What should I do?)
When leaving you is not an option babe
(Am I a fool)
When I know that where this is headed babe
(This isn't new?)
Weather I stay or weather I go I just go with the flow
Cause there's no turning back, there's no turning back

[Chorus]
I must like having you hurt me
Girl and i knew we was done right from the start
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
Cause I just can't seem to leave you alone

[Chorus]
I must like having you hurt me
Girl and i knew we was done right from the start
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
Cause I just can't seem to leave you alone

[Verse 3]
(Why can't I leave you alone girl)
Your running the show I have no control
(Wish I could turn me off but I won't)
I can't let you go

[Chorus]
I must like having you hurt me
Girl and i knew we was done right from the start
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
Cause I just can't seem to leave you alone

[Chorus]
I must like having you hurt me
Girl and i knew we was done right from the start
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
(I) I must love drama
Cause I just can't seem to leave you alone
