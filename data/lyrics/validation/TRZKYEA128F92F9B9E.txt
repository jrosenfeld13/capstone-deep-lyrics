Crane

Want me, take me, need me - it's all in your mind
Love me, hold me, want me - hoping I'll be kind
You think that up here I'm so special
But put in a crowd I would be just like you

You think to be with me, would make a change in hou
You think to be with me, you're special too
Want me, need me, take me, - it's all in your mind
Love me, hold me, want me, - hoping I'll be kind

You don't want me,you don't need me
All you need is sex with fame
You don't want me, you don't need me
All you need is sex with fame

Want me, need me, take me, - it's all in your mind
You want a group each night - tonight you want me
You think that up here I'm something so special
But put in a crowd I would be just like you

You think to be with me would make a change in you
You think to be with me, you're special too
Want me, need me, love me, - it's all in your mind
You want a group each night - tonight you want me

You don't want me, you don't need me
All you need is sex with fame
You don't want me, you don't need me
All you need is sex with fame
