I will love you forever
We will always be together
I will never stop loving you

Through the Summer and the Winter
Our love grows like no other
I can never stop loving you

And in her sighs, I know
Why I can please her, too slow
Know that I love her
When the sun is in her eyes

I will love you forever
We will always be together
I can never stop loving you
