And like any other monday
Promise of discipline
At the end of the day
And like any other monday
Promise of discipline
At the end of the day
There is always something new to fix

And my windows are open
But my closets not clean
Every winter seems shorter
As Im counting up to 36

See the steps in the ballroom
I still doubt in between
Always late to all the parties
I had to learn some dirty tricks

Now Im not getting wiser
But I still fit in my jeans
Time is building me a room
That I still cant find at 36

Whos talking?
Who listens?
Whos turning off?
Whos got it?
Who missed it?
Whos still in love?

Someday back to my hometown
Nothing else to conceal
I will shake off my boots
Say that I was never 36
