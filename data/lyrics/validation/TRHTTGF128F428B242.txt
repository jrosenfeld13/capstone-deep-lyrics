If i'm not over you by the time i get to georgia
Then i guess i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
Yeah
I always wanted to get married
And i thought you were the one
But you never ever asked me
And i was tired of hanging on
You know a girl can only be let down
So many times before she runs
And now this little bitty town's only got room for one of us
You always said i'd never leave
And if i did i wouldn't go far
So i know how i must look
With my tank of gas and beat up heart
Well baby i'm gone for good
You can count on that
Yeah i'm gonna keep headin west
Till i'm too far gone to come back
And if i'm not over you
By the time i get to georgia
Then i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
Only got 10 miles to go
Before i cross the state line
I can feel my hands shakin
Cause they usually turn the wheel around about this time
I heard that same old voice inside
I had to drown it out
So i found me a radio station playin somethin fast
And turn it up real loud
And if i'm not over you by the time i get to georgia
Then i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
If i'm not over you by georgia
Then i'll head to alabama
Roll onto mississippi
And maybe louisianna
I'll drive all the way to california
Oh i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
No i won't turn around.............
