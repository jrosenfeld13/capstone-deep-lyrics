You bloody liar
I feel the spear
You've spread the poison
And I've learned my lesson
I hear the wind
Whispering in my ear
I see the light of day
I feel death is near

Murderer - What have you done
Murderer - The hero's gone
Murderer - With pain you shall die
Murderer - Your soul will cry

The sun goes down, the night is falling
Gods of darkness surround my soul
You faceless evil, you took my blood
Heaven knows who murdered me

Murderer - What have you done
Murderer - The hero's gone
Murderer - With pain you shall die
Murderer - Your soul will cry
