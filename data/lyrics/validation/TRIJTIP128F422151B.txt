[Rap] + (sung)
(I'm all grown up) Now, and I listened and learned
A true star and I'm finally, gettin my turn
Took my L, earnt my spot
I'ma be here for a minute sonny boy if you like it or not
While you think chicks and whips, I'm on the out though
Laid back, sun in my face, just like Pa-blo
Or Tony Mon-tana, the world is mines
Ain't a cloud in the sky that could stop my shine
I love it - I done came from the grime and grit (now)
Now I'm on top shinin on some rhymin {shit}
When you think about, me, you think of the best
Like a full length mink, or a new Corvette
Yes, when I spit, consider the mess (now)
Up out my past, six digits, nuttin less
When you think of Jackie O, you think of success (yeah)
Success, success

[Chorus: singers]
I'm all grown up, now
Gonna show this world how a woman takes on it all
And watch the old guard fall
I'm ready for, the, world to come to me
Everyone to see
I'll make you believe I'm in control

[rap] + (sung)
(I'm all grown up) Destiny shines, take your fame and make it mine
Listen yo that old cheap flow got to go
Took my setbacks, got knocked out, but I ain't sweat that
Tryin to lean back, count chips, and get my greenbacks
(I'm all grown up) Take a loss, but baby back, like who the boss
I'ma show you how to floss in that Boxster Porsche
Never thought it be this way, huh, 'til I made it
On bend, got my money right, fame's what I've waited on
(I'm all grown up) For years I've been hated on, spit on and kicked on
(Now) Ain't nobody stoppin my flow, I'ma let you know
Baby girl the big show, rise and fall
One blink of the eye, surprised, you can't take this all
See life try to do me, snuff me, one to me
Industry is shady, family try to sue me
That's the life I live, try to shush me I come back strong
Stay on top and last for long

[Chorus]

[singers]
I'm all grown up, now, ooooooh
I'm all grown up.. ooooooh
I'm all grown up, now, ooooooh
