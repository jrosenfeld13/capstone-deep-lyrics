Now there's an open road
Baby I've got to go 'cause I've been here for far too long
We had our good times I know but baby I'm gettin' old
And the winters are far too cold for rock n' roll
We were never the perfect couple
We were never nothin' but trouble
We gotta do it one more time
One night together
One more time, one crazy ride
One more time, on one another
One more time we say goodbye
I can't stay with you forever
Baby you're the best fun that I've had
So one more time one night together
Make it mad!
Now it's the time to leave, didn't we both agree
There's a lot more for us to do and the world to see (Yeah, didn't we?!)
Free, the feeling of great relief when I hear the sound of my wheels
I've set myself free again back on the streets
We were never the perfect couple
We were never nothin' but trouble
We gotta do it one more time!
One night together
One more time, One crazy ride
One more time , On one another
One more time we say goodbye
I can't stay with you forever
Baby you're the best fun that I've had
So one more time one night together
Make it mad!
Make it mad!
We were never the perfect couple
We were never nothin' but trouble
We gotta do it one more time!
One night together
One more time, One crazy ride
One more time , On one another
One more time we say goodbye
I can't stay with you forever
Baby you're the best fun that I've had
So one more time one night together
Make it mad!
