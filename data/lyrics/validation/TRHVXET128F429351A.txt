(Attention please Southbound bus loading Gate No 8
All aboard for Willow Springs Taboule Rogersville Paskanaw Ravanden
Belaford Johnsborro Marktree and Memphis all aboard South all aboard please)
I drive for the bus line to all points south I drive
Guess I've heard a million stories from the folks that ride
Have your tickets ready please and don't forget to check your grid
And I'm a leavin' on another one of my hurried southern trips
These big wheels roll in the heat and the cold
When the thunder and the lightenin' whips
And the folks that ride got a reason to ride on a hurried southern trips

With a tear filled eyes a young girl got on board at Willow Springs
She was bearing child and I didn't see a ring
I'm on my way to Memphis she said through trembling lips
At the unwed mother's home I'll end up my hurried southern trip
A man stepped aboard in Memphis said do you remember me
I rode here with you to Luthportworth in 1953
And I've been in prison all these years cause I made one bad slip
And I took him home to Rogersville on a hurried southern trip
These big wheels roll in...

A soldier boy said hello Joe it's been a long long time
Do you still make a special stop and the Shannon County Line
It wasn't long till we were there to meet the folks he'd missed
Tears of joy filled every eye on that hurried southern trip
These big wheels roll in...
