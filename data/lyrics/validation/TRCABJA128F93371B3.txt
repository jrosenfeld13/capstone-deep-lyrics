Why don't we fall in love tonight
This crazy moon is shining bright
And nightingales are out of mind
All night
And as a token of my love
I'll buy you tons of precious stuff
A golden ring and a diamond glove
My love

(chorus)
Tra-la-la-la-la
You always make me feel so good
Tra-la-la-la-la
I wanna fly
Tra-la-la-la-la
A million miles from Hollywood
I don't know why I wanna cry
I know you born to be a star
And drive a fancy schmancy car
I never liked to smoke cigars
So far
Why don't we fall in love so hard
So nothing can break us apart
And we'll go shopping in Walmart
Sweetheart

(chorus)
