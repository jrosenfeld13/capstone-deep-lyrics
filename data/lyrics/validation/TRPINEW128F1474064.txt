Dancing around
Into the isle
And into the yard
Yes, practicing
Yes we're practicing
For war
Walk off stage. Walk off stage
Walk off stage
Walk off stage

Ohhh
The request; the response
The request; the response
The request; the response
The request; the response
The request; the response
Beg for your fingertips
Beg for your fingertips
The emeralds that we claim cost nothing unless we walk off stage and then
Bury it for all to see
(Bury it)
Bury it for all to see
The request; the response
The request; the response
The request; the response

Oh, precious diamonds
Precious diamonds
Precious diamonds
Precious diamonds
Ohh
