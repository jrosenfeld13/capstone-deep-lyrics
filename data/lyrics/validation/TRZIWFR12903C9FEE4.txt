Plant the germ of terror
Sow the seed of hate
Penetrate receptive minds
Scatter terminate
Silent without warning
Awake the sleeping cell
A suicideology
A nihilistic hell

You are my wall of silence
You are my tool of violence
You are my death alliance
Through you I scream defiance

Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate

Cleanse the world in chaos
Die without a care
Tend a bitter harvest
In my pasture of despair
An enemy of sorrow
Maximize the kill
Devastation hit or miss
A sweet or bitter pill

You are my wall of silence
You are my tool of violence
You are my death alliance
Through you I scream defiance

Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate

Inside your head inside your head
Inside your head, I'm planting
Inside your head inside your head
Inside your head, I'm planting

You are my wall of silence
You are my tool of violence
You are my death alliance
Through you I scream defiance

Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate
