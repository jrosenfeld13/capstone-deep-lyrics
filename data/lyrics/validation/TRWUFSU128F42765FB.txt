Bandage our broken bodies
On these tightropes we're walking
I don't ever think we can make it
Across this open sky alone

My fingertips are frozen until the point
Of forgetting where I'm from
But sometimes the dead can't
Forget like young lovers

We were left to dread the days of mouths
To feed and no one to come save us
