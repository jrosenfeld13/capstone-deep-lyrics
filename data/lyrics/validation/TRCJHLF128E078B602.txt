It's time that we started believing
We've all got a place in the world
So why can't we harness the feeling
That lies deep inside of us all?

Well here comes the end of the century
And what are we thinking of?
It's time to stop fighting your enemy
And offer some friendship and hope, peace, and love

Rock to the rhythm of love
Take a ride on the rhythm of love
Rock to the rhythm of love
Take a ride on the rhythm of love

It's time that we started believing
To show that we're willing to try
It's never too late to be changing
So don't let this chance pass us by

Well aren't we all part of a family
And hasn't our family suffered enough?
Let's put an end to the fighting
And make the world rock to the rhythm of love

Rock to the rhythm of love
Take a ride on the rhythm of love
Rock to the rhythm of love
Yeah, take a ride on the rhythm of love

No violence, no hate, no pain, no enemies
Just peace, unity, tolerence and love

No violence, no hate, no pain, no enemies
Just peace, unity, tolerence and love

C'mon, take a ride
Rock to the rhythm of love
Yeah, ride on the rhythm of love
Let's rock to the rhythm of love
Oh, take a ride

Yeah, ride on the rhythm of love

Take a ride
