Hummingbird, hummingbird should be your name
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame
Hummingbird, hummingbird should be your name

Hummingbird, hummingbird winging along
No tender young blossom can hold you for long
No tender young blossom can hold you for long
Hummingbird, hummingbird winging along

You'd hug me and kiss me like others I've known
You'd promise to love me and call me your own
Then all of my dreams would be shattered apart
By the hum hum of your hummingbird heart

Hummingbird, hummingbird, feathered so fine
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine
Hummingbird, hummingbird, feathered so fine

Hummingbird, hummingbird, fly right on by
Some folks like to gamble, but darling not I
Some folks like to gamble, but darling not I
Hummingbird, hummingbird, fly right on by

I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be blue
Yes, I'd rather spend my whole life without you
Then feather a nest to be shattered apart
By the hum hum of your hummingbird heart
By the hum hum of your hummingbird heart
