Passionate onanists standing under the crucifix
The heavens are pouring tears for the nailed one
A wall of flesh is build with human bricks
When the demiurge reigns supreme the true god is done

The false prophets of the Old Testament vomiting a thousand lies
Man-made rules tied together with the savior's blood
But the ones within the truth are opening their eyes
Fearlessly encountering the god behind the god

Sacred names printed with gold on black parchments
Truth decoded from meaningless paraphrases
Underground sects performing pure sacraments
Summoning the hermaphrodite god of multiple faces

The children of Bethlehem are buried under the mourner's bench
But their souls dance high above in the heavenly hall
Transcendental flowers cover the profane stench
At the feet of the Pharisees the earth-bound maggots crawl

"Now when the heavens had consolidated themselves
Along with their forces and all their administration
The prime parent became insolent
And he was honored by all the army of angels
And all the gods and their angels
Gave blessing and honor to him
And for his part, he was delighted
And continually boasted, saying to them

"I have no need of anyone" He said
"It is I who am God
And there is no other one that exists apart from me

I will go before thee
And make the crooked places straight:
I will break in pieces the gates of brass
And cut in sunder the bars of iron

And I will give thee the treasures of darkness
And hidden riches of secret places
That thou mayest know that I, the Lord
Which call thee by thy name
Am the God of Israel

I am the Lord, and there is none else
There is no God beside me:
I girded thee, though thou hast not known me

That they may know from the rising of the sun
And from the west, that there is none beside me
I am the Lord, and there is none else

I form the light, and create darkness:
I make peace, and create evil:
I the Lord do all these things

I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
Visiting the iniquity of the fathers
Upon the children unto the third
And fourth generation of them that hate me"

And when he said this, he sinned
Against all the immortal beings who give answer
And they laid it to his charge

Then when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler
She was filled with anger
She was invisible
She said, "You are mistaken, Samael"
(That is, "blind god")
"There is an immortal man of light
Who has been in existence before you
And who will appear among your modeled forms
He will trample you to scorn
Just as potter's clay is pounded
And you will descend to your mother
The abyss, along with those that belong to you

For at the consummation of your works
The entire defect that has become visible
Out of the truth will be abolished
And it will cease to be
And will be like what has never been"
