Standing at the party talking to this bloke, he said he fancied me I thought it was a joke
But when he tried to kiss me I thought it's time to hide, i'll go find the bog and lock myself inside

Never made it, never made it, never made it, to the bog in time

Later in the party with joint in hand, so pissed and proud I could hardly stand
I started to feel sick it must have been the dope, I tried to reach the bog but there wasn't much hope

Stumbled home from the party about half hour, had trouble getting the key into the door
My bladder was full and it wouldn't wait, by the time I reached the bog it was too late
