If you give me the gun
Well I'll shoot myself in the foot
And I want it to be different this time
But I know that won't
So I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah I need a friend
This time
Hard working and under slept
But lazy at heart
Everything that you know you want
Seems like no big deal when it starts
So come take my hand my dear
And show me where I should draw the line
Cuz I need a friend this time
That's why I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah I need a friend
This time

To all my brothers before me
Well I can't let you down
But I need you to push me baby
To Stop Screwing around
Because I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah I need a friend
This time
