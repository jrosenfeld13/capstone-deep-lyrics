It's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappoint you
I didn't mean to tell you lies
And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
One more try...
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try..
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it, one more try

It's been a long time since I've kissed you
It always used to feel so good
And if you know, how much I missed you
You'd forgive me if you could
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try (one more try)
One more try...
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try..
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it, one more try

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why...
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try (one more try)
One more try...
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try..
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it, one more try

Give me one more try
