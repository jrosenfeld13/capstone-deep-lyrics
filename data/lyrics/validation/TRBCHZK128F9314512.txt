Clockwork is usually the way good things work
But if you're someone like me then clockwork is worst
So someone please tell me I'm doing no wrong
And someone please tell me we didn't write this song

[Chorus]
Now I can't even tell
I can't even tell
The difference between
You, her friend, and her

So take me home tonight (take me home tonight)
Take me home tonight (take me home tonight)
Take me as far away from her (yeah!)

And I do use the memories of us
But I use them more, more like a drug
So doctor please help me and make them understand
If there was one sweet girl you bet I'd be her man

[Chorus]
So someone kill me tonight (someone kill me tonight)

So someone kill me tonight (someone kill me tonight)
And me
My mind's with her (yeah!)

Aww, Kim we were kids you angel of a girl
And Julie just seduced me when I was a little boy
Jen was just weird and Becky was so nice
It all happened so damn fast one night after a night
But all day it should stop right now
But after you left it was my lack of falling down
And mary was just fucked
And the girl who had no name
And Chloe always told me
I took away the pain
And Robin we were mostly drunk
And at times it was a rush
And the rest we're well I was halfway there
Alone and all messed up

Well I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye
I looked each one in the eye but we never knew
No, we never knew
We never knew
