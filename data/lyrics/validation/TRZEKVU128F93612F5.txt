[Verse]
Almost all of my life every day and every night
The only thing that I could think of
Was doing all I could do to find me a true blue
A foxy little lady to love
I looked uptown down-town looking all around town
Searching and trying so hard
Looking for the right face but looking in the wrong place
I should have looked in my back yard
Cause I found everything I was a looking for
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door
She went away to college to get herself some knowledge
She just got back a month ago
She had changed a whole lot I found out she was not
That little girl I used to know
As little freckled faced tomboy who used to make a lot of noise
Running around the neighbourhood
Was sitting on the front porch in a pair of short shorts
And buddy she was looking good
I got what I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door
We're going to move way out to a little biddy town
Where the living is nice and slow
Where they ain't got nothing but a general store
One street and a picture show
I hope we have a little boy going to be my pride and joy
Raise him by the golden rule
Watch him while he grows tall fishing poles and football
Apple pie and Sunday school
So goodbye bright lights single bars and wild nights
Goodbye all you partying girls
You can't find what I've got in honky tonks and night spots
And I wouldn't trade it for the world
Tell the boys at the hideaway I hope they had a nice day
Tell them all I said goodbye
I would've dropped around but I'm going out of town
And besides I've got a ring to buy
So long old friend I'm headed out the door
With my blue eyed ever loving pretty little girl next door the girl next door
I got all I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door I said the girl next door

[Outro]
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door[x4]
