Have you heard about my screams
Cause I like a drink and I haven't touched one in weeks
Can the blind see through the eyes
Of a dog or is it just attention I seek

Have you ever known it to be
Because I know you're warming to me
And I know you're waiting you're always ready

You keep your mouth in your backside baby
And you're using it daily in my defense
You wear the devil in your shoes lately
And you're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled

Have you burned right to the seams
Cause I'm on my feet
And haven't touched down in weeks
Can the blind see through these eyes
See through the fog or is it just attention I seek

Have you ever known it to be
Because I know your warming to me
And I know you're waiting you're always ready

You keep your mouth in your backside baby
And you're using it daily in my defense
You wear the devil in your shoes lately
And you're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled
Yes, you're walking all over the times when I've known you
Walking all over the times when I've known you
Walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled

Have you every known it to be
Because I know you're warming to me
And I know you're waiting you're always ready

And I know you can't keep reeling
From just your own free wheeling
And I know you're waiting you're always ready you see

You wear the devil in your shoes lately
And you're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled

You're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled
You're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled
You're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled
Yes, you're walking all over the times when I've known you
And smiled

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
