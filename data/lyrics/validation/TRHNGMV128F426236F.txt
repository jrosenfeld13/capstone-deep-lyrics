[Verse 1:]
Gotta love for destruction
Gotta feel for danger tonight
Hey, Mr. Moonlight
Won't you follow me down?

I need the company
Everybody tells me you`re no good
That`s all right with me

[Chorus:]
Gimme one shot of poison
A little twist
Is all I need

One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
Come on, baby
Poison me

[Verse 2:]
Gotta hunger for fatal attraction
I`m saving all my passion for you
I gotta heartbreak habit
That I can`t kick

Only you can ease the pain
I`m a midnight animal
Trying to score
Before I go insane

[Chorus:]
Gimme me one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free

One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
Give me one last kiss
Before I die

I`m flying high
On your love tonight
Baby

[Chorus:]
One shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free

One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
One shot of poison
Come on, baby
Poison me

One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
One shot
