In my other world

There is no pain

And all my thoughts
Are clouds of happiness

In my other world

My heart beats red

There is no gun

Pointed at my head

And I don't really want your kiss

My thoughts don't make me cry
My heart's not filled with grey sadness

My ears can't hear you lie

And I can't even see your face

I've never heard your name
My heart is still my thoughts are calm

And light has filled this space

In my other world
My pain is bliss

I own your soul
I own your kiss

In my other world
