The time for lenience has passed
A call to all beneath will sound
I radio for back-up mallets
And they crawl up from the undertow
A machevelian portrait crashes
A meteor of steam collides
We will be searching through your ashes
To find exactly why you tried to
Doom us all to save yourself

If i could reach salvation i'd take that path
But i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
If i could leave this nation you'd never have a chance
'cause i'd bury all the races...

I see the white blind faith corrupting
The future of my tis of thee
It's easier just not confronting
But i'd rather die than let you lead

Now if i could reach salvation i'd take that path
But i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
If i could heal this nation you'd never have a chance
'cause i'd bury all the races and fade to black
If i could reach salvation i'd take that path
But i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
If i could heal this nation you'd never have a chance
And i don't think it's racist to watch you crash and burn!

All the kings horsemen are dead
And i'm left to clean up the mess
Realizing your shame
I choose to revel in it
Fucking stupid game
But i love to watch you lose it

Leaders changed beyond the color
Forced to face a weaker flex
One that swallowed shit forever
Has now come raging back... back... back!

Now if i could reach salvation i'd take that path
But i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
If i could heal this nation you'd never have a chance
'cause i'd bury all the races and fade to black
Now if i could reach salvation i'd take that path
But i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
If i could heal this nation you'd never have a chance
And i don't think it's racist to watch you crash and burn!
Watch you crash and burn...
Watch you crash and
Watch you crash and
Watch you crash and burn...
