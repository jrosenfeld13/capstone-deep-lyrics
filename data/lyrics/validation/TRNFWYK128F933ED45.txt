Deep inside, we're ready for a ride
For a jump over gaps to the secret side
From time immemorial, from time immemorial
Imagine thoughts sent from lightsyears away
By a star still shimmering at the sky
A star that exploded ages ago
It never will get your reply
If we'd only knew 'bout the cosmic rules
Why circles run in periods
If we'd only knew 'bout the unknown codes
We'd cry, we'd cry
One grain of sand contains an universe
And sunsystems in a grain of sand
Are we actually living in a micro-
Or a macro cosmic land

Philosophers stone is rolling
Somewhere to the nuclear bomb
Should a fool once presses the button
Than it's rather too late to rock and stomp
Rather too late to rock and stomp
Rather too late to rock and stomp
Rather too late to rock and stomp

All you possess is in our mind
So start with the inner revolution
Einstein discreeted his last formula
'Cause it wouldn't have been mankinds solution
Mr. Hitler was obsessed by demons
Mr. Nero py a perverted game
"Panem et circenses" for the crowd -
Today isn't it just the same?
What's all about those hexagrams
Is it the "J" in their names, that has them killed
Jimmy H., Janis J., Jim M. and B. Jones
Or just another public-relation-thrill?
So brother they tell you, to be jive to survive
Save your believe, teeth, car and your guitar
And take yourself just by the hand
Smile gently while you explode like a star!

While you explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
Explode like a star
