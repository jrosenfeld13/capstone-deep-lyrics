I know you never asked for my opinion
But I'd say that horse is crazy
I know what I think doesn't matter any more
But I'd say his mind is gone
And I know you know what I know
Even though you'd rather die than say it
I know you feel the same way
Or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me

There was a reason why I came here
But I guess now it doesn't matter
I had a good, good, good, good reason
But I guess now you couldn't care
There is a certain kind of feeling that you get
When you're totally helpless
And there's a different world waiting for me
When I lift my head up from your thick, dark hair

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big nostrils flaring
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me
