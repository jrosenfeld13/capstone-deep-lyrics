See her there
She hangs from me
See her face
She can't let go
I can't look in here eyes
She's holding on
She needed this to hurt me so
So it shot out of me
As if all of the love just got ripped out of me
She said I'm such a sap, I'm such a jerk
Can't I ever forget the way that we are
Spend all your time with your eyes on the ground
Looking for the stars

So it shot out of me
As if all of the love just got ripped out of me

And just for that moment I saw in her eyes
How it all could be
It shot out of me

Say this is it
This is all there is
You have to remember this
This is all there is

(chorus)
Spend all your time with your eyes on the ground
Looking for the stars
So it shot out of me
As though all of the love has been ripped out of me
