Manowar, Manowar, living on the road
When we're in town, speakers explode
We don't attract wimps
Cause we're too loud
Just true metal people
That's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up
We're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
Other bands play, Manowar kills
Other bands play, Manowar kills

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps
Man, they blast
True metal people wanna rock, not pose
Wearing yeans and leather
Not Cracker Jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up
We're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
Other bands play, Manowar kills
Other bands play, Manowar kills

Now listen to me

We are the kings of metal
Coming to town
When we light up
Have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
Cause there ain't no way
That we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up
We're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning
We always will
Other bands play, Manowar kills

We're the kings of metal
Kick your ass
Kick your ass
Manowar kills
Coming to town, we're gonna
Kick your ass

We're the kings of metal
Manowar kills
Coming to town, we're gonna
Kick your ass
We're the kings of metal
Manowar kills

Kick your ass
Manowar kills
We're the kings of metal
Kick your ass
Coming to town
Manowar kills
Coming to town, we're gonna
Kick your ass

Kings of metal
Manowar kills
Kick your ass
