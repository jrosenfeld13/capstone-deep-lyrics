Wake to sound again, still tinnitus reigns
Waiting for the call, and the time to state it all
Don't say a word
Just lay like a stone and gather what it's worth
I long to see her eyes, shining like a light
That's taken hold my soul, and everything I know
Don't say a word
Just breath like the breeze, till those eyes open slow
Before I rise I wish that I and everything I am
Will never fail, fall or bail or be a spineless man
Carry love till death and open up my chest
To damn the world, damn the pain and find our way
The will ist unsurpassed
The courage always lasts
The passion's always warm
The spirit's never torn
Don't say a word
Just wake with the sun, and stand up for the one
Now I rise I wish that I and everything I am
Will never fail, fall or bail or be a spineless man
Carry love till death and open up my chest
To damn the world, damn the pain and find our way
