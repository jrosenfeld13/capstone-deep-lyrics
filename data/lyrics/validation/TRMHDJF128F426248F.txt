Tonight we're alone and the music is right, tonight
Do you feel good? Do you feel alright tonight?

I'm out on the streets tonight
I'm with a few friends so it feels alright
Shouting out loud to this song doesn't do it
If it doesn't sink in then I say, screw it

Same old vices not much to dream about
Is there anything left to fight about
Fight to live is the only fight
I've got left in me

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

Well, I've never been the same since that first show
I close my eyes and let myself go
To place I'm never alone or scared
Somehow I had a reason to care

I get so lost in it
I get so lost in it
I get so lost in it
I get so lost in it

Live to fight
Fight to live
Live to fight
Fight to live

Tonight we're alone and the music is right, tonight
Do you feel good? Do you feel alright?
Tonight we're alone and the music is right, tonight
Do you feel good? Do you feel alright tonight?

I'm on the train and I've got my phones
People all around but I'm good all alone
I won't worry what I need to be
Wherever I am, that's the place to be

Go go! (wherever I am, that's the place to be)
Go go!
Go go!
Go go!

Tonight we're alone and the music is right, tonight
Do you feel good? Do you feel alright?
Tonight we're alone and the music is right, tonight
Do you feel good? Do you feel alright tonight?
We feel good we feel alright tonight
