Body working overtime
Emotion overload it's crazy
I'm into you (got the habit)
Know what do to (got the habit)
I'm into you

You and me working up an appetite
While on the telephone you tease me
That's what you do I know that you hunger too
(Got the habit)
I'm into you
Don't say no

Let me come on aver again
I just got to have you again

Waiting for your waterfall
Just let me drink you down I want to
D'ya want me to (got the habit)
I'm into you (got the habit)
I'm into you

Just say yeah

I'm into you
Listen to me
You know I've got be next to your body
Don't want to find you're leaving me behind
Don't change your mind
Oh baby won't you

Let me come on aver again
I just got to have you again

Come again
Come again
Come again
