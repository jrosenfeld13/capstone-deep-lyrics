I called my baby back (How did you call?)
I called her on the telephone (What did she say?)
She told me she was all alone (What did you do?)
Got a ticket on the very next train (Going where?)
Going home so I could explain
Why I was a thousand miles away that day
When she needed me

I finally got home now (What did you find?)
My baby had slipped the scene (Where did she go?)
Over the mountain and across the stream (What did you do?)
Tried to follow her every track (How come?)
I had to try to get my baby back
Because I was a thousand miles away that day
When she needed me

Fellas, let me tell you, pay close attention to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you love your baby (What should we do?)
Dont you ever let your baby down (What should we do?)
Always be there when she needs you around (And if we dont?)
If you dont youll be just like me (How are you?)
Im as lonesome as I can be
Because I was a thousand miles away that day
When she needed me (Where were you when she needed you?)
I was a thousand miles away that day
When she needed me (Where were you when she needed you?)
Oh, I was a thousand miles away that day
