She walks in the street's at midnight
Full moon shines in her hair
A victim of circumstances blinded by fear
She's stalking her prey she's looking for
To be set free, Misleading all men with open arms
And false security

Lost in the shadows of times long ago
Look for the answer how does she know

She waits to be released from chains set long ago
She waits to sleep silent again
She waits to be released from a pain she didn't know
She never understands the pain

Passion runs deep inside her soul
She's cursed for their sins
Search for a friend she may never know
The peace that lies within

She journeys forever she's lost in the night
She's forced to stalk again
Walking the streets she's hoping to find
An end to her shame

Lost in the shadows of times long ago
Look for the answer how does she know
