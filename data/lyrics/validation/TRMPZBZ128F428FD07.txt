I want to tell you about the way I felt yesterday
My emotions they got in the way
How quickly I forgot to trust you Lord
To stand upon the promise of your Word
But faith grabbed a hold of me, and it changed my unbelief
My heart has been restored once again
I believe in you Lord. I'm sorry for not trusting you before
(But faith grabbed a hold of me and changed my unbelief)
My heart has been restored once again
Now things are different, than the day before
God made a way. He opened up a door, oh
In just one day everything has changed
God answered me and now I'm no longer the same
Oh, some things I've lost some things I've gained
My heart will never be the same. I have been restored once again
I believe in you Lord
(Ohh Ohh Ohh I believe in you Lord.)
I'm sorry for not trusting you before. (I thought I was trusting you before. Sorry for not trusting you with my whole heart, but faith grabbed a hold of me and changed my unbelief.)
My heart has been restored once again
My heart has been restored once again
My faith is renewed! Yes I'll trust you
My heart has been restored once again
My faith... Yes I'm trusting you Jesus
My faith is renewed right now. Oh Lord yes I'll trust in you Jesus
I'll trust you like I never trusted you before my faith is renewed. I feel stronger Jesus. I feel better Jesus
My faith looks up to Thee. Oh lamb of Calvary
My faith, my faith is renewed Jesus. Daily it's renewed! Daily it's renewed! Oh yes I'll trust! Yes I'll trust you all the more! My faith! Yes my faith's renewed
Yes... I'll trust you. I thought I was trusting you but now I can trust you all the more. I can trust you better than I did before
My faith, (yes it's renewed
)Yes I'll trust you Lord, through the thick and thin, through the muck and the myry clay
Yes I'll trust. I'll trust in you! My faith is renewed... Oh! I'll trust in you, Yeaha!
My heart has been restored once again, ohh... yes it is. My heart... it's restored, once... See if I never had a test, how could I have a testimony my heart...
Where you lead me that's where I'm gonna follow. My faith looks up to thee my heart (been restore, yes it has, yes it has)
