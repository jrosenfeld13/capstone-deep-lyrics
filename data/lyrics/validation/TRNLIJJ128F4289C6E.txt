Out along the edges of the night
Somewhere between the dawn and the light
She said, love's not just a picture in a book
And then she made me take another look

Sweet release, she's lettin' her love show
Sweet release, I'm lettin' it all go
Take me, please, won?t you take me, please
Oh, my sweet release

It's the way that she makes up for what I'd lack
The way she gives herself without holdin' back
And when I come to tell her of my dreams
It's the way she knows exactly what I mean

Sweet release, she's lettin' her love show
Sweet release, I'm lettin' it all go
Take me, please, won?t you take me, please
Oh, my sweet release

And when I've spent the time I have to spend
And I have seen a picture of the end
After all the words have flown away
And love has finally found a place to stay

Sweet release, she's lettin' her love show
Sweet release, I'm lettin' it all go
Take me, please, won?t you take me, please
Well, you've got to take me, please
Oh, my sweet release
