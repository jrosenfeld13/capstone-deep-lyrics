I should'a know back then
When I said
Why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then, but then again

I should'a know back then
When I said
Why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then, but then again

Knife in my hand and a girl, named Maria
Kneeling by my side
Staring at me with exaltation in her eyes
Speakind to me in spanglish
I don't know who I am but I understand the language
She says, you've been dreaming since the 7th century baby

I should'a know back then
When I said why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then
That i'd wind up on my knee's like a bull in a pen

I should'a know back then
When I said why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then, but then again

I got a locust in my throat
Right now she's sleeping
Yesterday she got intoxicated on my speaking
I tried to tell her not to drink all my saliva
I tried to tell not to leave me behind
I said can't you see you're leaving me sore
I swear I heard her laugh as she drunk some more

I should'a know back then
When i said why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then
I should'a know back then, but then again

I should'a know back then
When I said why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then
That i'd wind up on my knee's like a bull in a pen

Maria's crying as she takes my knife
She says sometimes I wanna kill myself
But I'm scared that I might die
Sometimes I fly through liquid sky
Faking it all the way to heaven
When I get there I'll tell them that I tried
I tried to save men Mau
But they didn't want what I gave them mau
I tried to save men
But they didn't want what I gave them

I should'a know back then
When I said why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then
That i'd wind up on my knee's like a bull in a pen

I should'a know back then
Why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know, know, know
I should'a know, I should'a know I should'a know...

Why, what, who, where, when
I should'a know back then
That i'd wind up on my knee
She says
Hold on
One last thing
