In the middle of the night she struts around
A yellow taxi to the heart of downtown
Black stockings and a cocktail dress
Purple eyeshadow
Its so hard for her to meet a man
With a secret they wont understand
But her emotions are much deeper than...
The underground freakshow

Now if a man feels like a woman
Does that make him less a man
If he hides the truth inside his painted hands
No esta una chica
Un chico un chico
No esta una chica
Un chico un chico, claro

After hours under candlelight
She pulled a vision in a suit and tie
Masculine with a willing smile
They went home together

"you know im different than you think i am."
He leaned over by the bedside stand
The suit and tie had a gun in his hand
An affair to remember...

Chorus
