You spoke my language
And used no words at all
Some long lost melody
A distant bird call
And so we walked along beneath the city street lights
And it was magic
And it was all right

An explosion of creation
Never ending inspiration
And I could write a million songs about this love we
Share cause every minute that we spend
Is like a song to me

And it all comes so soon
And it all rings so true
And not a moment too soon
Now I'm falling I'm falling

You can't own it
And you can't see it
But you can feel it
And you can be it
And just like the bird which belongs to the sky above
Love cannot belong to us
Cause we belong to love

And it all comes so soon
And it all rings so true
And not a moment too soon
Now I'm falling I'm falling

In an instant it's forever
Scattered pieces come together
And you must tear down all the walls you built around you
Cause love is so big and now it's found you

And it all comes so soon
And it all rings so true
And not a moment too soon
Now I'm falling I'm falling
