My eyes wander in their blindness
My eyes consume truth
Take this time to decide my beliefs and stay true
Take this time to look inside my heart and find
If you look among the masses
You will wind that sex lust lies and greed only bring pain
Just remember where your heart lies and never let it fail or die
My God, I'm yours
