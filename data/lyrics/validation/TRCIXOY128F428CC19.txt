There's something strong that's coming from you
Oh and I'm picking up on it, baby
And the message that you're sending
I can put it on through, oh, good luck to me from you

I can tell someone's messing you around
Not treating you right and it's getting you down
Oh, I've got the cure

I wanna be your doctor
Has anything been ailing you?
Is anything been failing you?
Tell me the condition of your heart

Oh, I wanna be your doctor
Oh, I may not have to operate
Maybe I'll just vaccinate
Shoot you with some love
Until you get enough of me

Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart

Like a love is the condition, it's ailing you
And I'm picking up on you baby
Attention is all you need, that's what I conclude
Administer medicine on you

I may not have a PhD
Come and sit and talk with the lover in me
'Coz oh, I've got the cure

I wanna be your doctor
Has anything been ailing you?
Is anything been failing you?
Tell me the condition of your heart

Oh, I wanna be your doctor
Oh, I may not have to operate
Maybe I'll just vaccinate
I'll shoot you with my love
Until you get enough of me

Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart

Oh, I work on you just as much as I can
So I can get to feel your healin' hands
Oh, I can see the doctors, doctor in you
Maybe I can be your patient too

I wanna be your doctor
Has anything been ailin' you?
Is anything been failin' you?
Tell me the condition of your heart

Oh, I wanna be your doctor
Oh, may not have a PhD
But you can come and sit
And talk with the lover in me

Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart

Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart
