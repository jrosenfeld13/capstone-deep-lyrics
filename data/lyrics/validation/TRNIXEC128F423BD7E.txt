You got a new best man and I hope his hands will patch up what they can
Asleep with the tv on, marked funeral songs and many careless nights
Standing around in festival crowds

Turn on yr the phone and call him out
Drive through the cops so awkward
Darken the trail like jungle tracks
Waiting with heart shaped smoke rings
Candy? Cane!

You are the sum of your plans and burlesque won't stand for tan lines; make new plans
Asleep with the tent wrapped back, marked firesafe paths and many careless nights
Standing around in festival crowds

Turn on yr the phone and call him out
Drive through the cops so awkward
Darken the trail like jungle tracks
Waiting with heart shaped smoke rings
Candy? Cane!
