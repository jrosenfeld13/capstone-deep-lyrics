You broke my heart
'Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now I'm back
To let you know that
I can really shake 'em down

Do you love me (I can really move)
Now do you love me (I'm in the groove)
Ah do you love me (do you really love me)
Now that I can dance

Watch me now, oh
(Push, push) Ahh! shake it up, shake it up
(Push, push) Yea! Shake it, shake it down
(Push, push) Just a little bit of soul now

I can Mashed Potato (Mashed Potato)
I can do the twist (do the twist)
Well now tell me baby (tell me baby)
Do you like it like this (like it like this)
Tell me, (tell me), Oh tell me

Ah, do you love me (do you love me)
Now do you love me (do you love me)
Well do you love me (do you love me)
Now that I can dance

Watch me now, oh
(Push, push) Ahh! shake it up, shake it up
(Push, push) Yea! Shake it, shake it down
(Push, push) Oh! just a little bit of soul now

(Push, push) Well get rhythm baby
(Push, push) Oh! you're drivin' me crazy
(Push, push) Well just a little bit of soul now

I can Mashed Potato (Mashed Potato)
I can do the twist (do the twist)
Well now tell me baby (tell me baby)
Do you like it like this (like it like this)
Tell me, (tell me), Oh tell me

Ah, do you love me (do you love me)
Now do you love me (do you love me)
Well do you love me (do you love me)
Now that I can dance
