Somewhere in the world
It's three AM
And I'm dancing to
That broken record again
I hope she knows
Before I fall
Why does she only overflow
At curtain call

CHORUS
I wouldn't wish it on you
I wouldn't wish it on you
But I want to dive into
Into the deep end, in over my head
Into the deep end, in over my head

I want to be taken
By surprise by you
And I've got to stop having these dreams
You could never live up to
I've painted myself
Into a corner again
You know I've been here before
But I can't remember when

CHORUS

What was my escape is all that I have left
The further you go the deeper it gets
And if I don't get out I will probably drown
'Cause the water is sweet when it's going down

CHORUS

Into the deep end, in over my head
Into the deep end, in over my head
