Why should I hide
The way that you're making me feel inside
You're giving me signs that I can't deny
When I look at you
I've looked at love now
But love never showed me the way
But I look at you in a way
That I just can't explain

See I'm falling
And there's nothing I can do
Said I'm falling
And it's all because of you
Yes, I'm falling
And no matter how I try
There is not a day
That I can keep you from my mind

It's not that
I was looking for someone to share my life
I thought it would be such a waste of time
Until I found you
We'll I've realised
That I just can't disguise how I feel
So don't be surprised
When I look in your eyes and reveal

See I'm falling
And there's nothing I can do
Said I'm falling
And it's all because of you
Yes, I'm falling
And no matter how I try
There is not a day
That I can keep you from my mind

Don't tell me that you know
The way that I feel
Stop playing these games with my heart
Tell me that you're for real

See I'm falling
And there's nothing I can do
Said I'm falling
And it's all because of you
Yes, I'm falling
And no matter how I try
There is not a day
That I can keep you from my mind
