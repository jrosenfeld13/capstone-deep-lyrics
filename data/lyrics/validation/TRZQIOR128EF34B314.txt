When we were young they would break our hearts
You and I had to go undercover
We knew in time we would be pulled apart
We found a way we could hold on to each other

Gave our souls to another world
Sealed in blood with a sacred vow
Now we've forgotten but beneath all this
A part of you and me is still there now, yeah

Go on and sing, go on and dance
It'll all come back if you just give it a chance

Don't you remember me?
We were a secret society
Like in your memory
We were the secret society

Refresh your memory
We were the secret society
Until eternity
We are the secret society

I never see you in the waking world
We make an effort to avoid each other
But every night we penetrate the veil
Where everybody acts like sister and brother

You never speak the words in broad daylight
They're much too delicate and too naive
But everybody's been a witness sometime
It doesn't change it if you don't believe, so

Go on and sing

Secret, secret, secret
Secret, secret, secret

I never see you in the waking world
We make an effort to avoid each other
But every night we penetrate the veil
Where everybody acts like sister and brother

You never speak the words in broad daylight
They're much too delicate and too naive
But everybody's been a witness sometime
It doesn't change it if you don't believe, so

So, go on and sing, go on and dance
It'll all come back if you just give it a chance

And you'll remember me?
We were a secret society
Not just a memory
You're in the secret society

But you've got to go with me
You're in the secret society
Until eternity
We are the secret society
Ooh, we're so secret

Secret society
