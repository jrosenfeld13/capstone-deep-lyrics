Frozen forgetful again
The part where I lose my head
The scene where I'm supposed to speak but instead
I sit and listen again, I'm stuck with these cards I guessLeaping from this cliff in my thoughts
I fly like the stones in my heart
Drowning in doubt for what reason
I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can't escapeI'm ready now oh I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now come get meFearless with cape in hand
Conquer what I need to mend
Little girls get so broken
But I sit so patiently drenched in what you want me to be
I can't see no escapeI'm ready now oh I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now come get meThrough with golden roads and perfect love
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun
How I burn, how I burn
I was so patient, waiting for my turn
Fly like stone
As I break every bone
Come get meI'm ready now oh I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now come get meI'm ready now oh I'm ready now
Oh I'm ready now come get me
