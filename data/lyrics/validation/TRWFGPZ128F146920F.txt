I am where I used to be
Head under my pillow
This is where I hide, you see
From the people watching me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
I'm a big girl, I don't weep
Waiting for tomorrow
They are coming after me
They're always coming after me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
I am where I used to sleep
Head under my pillow
This is where I hide, you see
From the people watching me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
I'm a big girl, I don't weep
Waiting for tomorrow
They are coming after me
They're always coming after me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
They use electricity
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
They use electricity
They use electricity
The shadow's closing in on me
The shadow's closing in, ooh
