I'll never forget the way my eyes rolled back into my head
Drunken god, so easily bled
Fall between the seems, amputee
You're so much like me, longing to be freed
Have you come to hang me? Have you come to save me?
So violent, it seems, scar tissue that takes the place of dreams
And it screams, no
I want to hold you, but life isn't fair
I want to touch you; my arms are not there
Self mutilation, part of my life
Part of my strife
Amputee, amputee, amputee
Violent the song
And as sick as the day is long
