Hello, and welcome to the show
Its twenty for a ticket here
But tonight its gonna blow!

You heard them saying so
And everybodys there you know
So you just have to go

And phone the number on the show
You heard up on the radio
Got your ticket, pills and smoke
A little bit of both
And all the other kidsll choke, man theyll wanna see
Its gonna be the Best of partys

Raver party, Mosher party, Posher party
Dirty Party, Warehouse Party
Any kind a party, is the same old party

Sold, and standing in the cold, and spending half an hour in that queue
Whats a boy to think? I really need a drink
But waiting at the bar takes an hour too
Let me through
In here
A fiver for a beer
A system you can hardly hear
And these pills are mongy too
Youre coming up too soon
Its pressing at your stomach now, but theres a long line at that loo

Youre feeling like you need a little time to chill out
So sit down baby
Now everything is spinning out in front of your eyes
Youve realised

Its all for sale
Welcome to the commercials yo
A receipt and a guarantee
Is this the place we longed to be?
Sale of the century
Breath deeper
BREATH
Breath harder
Its all for sale
And we hope that you all enjoy
For twelve weeks boy
The city is theirs

And so, come join us at the show
Its twenty for a ticket here
But tonight its gonna blow!

Just look around the room
Its full of people just like you
Listen up
Can you hear it too?

Its ringing all around
The muffled and pathetic sound
Of the product they supply
The flyer is a lie
Their registers are jingling with a dream we tried to buy

Youre feeling like you need a little time to chill out
So sit down baby
It feel a little better when you close up both eyes
And ride on this high

Oh, and think about just how good it could be
Excuse me while I take little time to chill out

Oh, the people dance holding hands to the beat
Just make-up, Dont wake-up me if Im having a dream
One nation, one world together like peaches and cream
Excuse me while I take a little time to chill out

Well all I want is just a little time to chill out
Just chill out baby

But now hes telling you that sleeping gets you thrown out
Hes pushing from behind
Now everything is spinning out in front of your eyes
Youve realised

Its all for sale
Welcome to the commercials yo
A receipt and a guarantee
Is this the place we longed to be?
Sale of the century
Breath deeper
BREATH
Breath harder
Its all for sale
And we hope that you all enjoy
For twelve weeks boy
The city is theirs
