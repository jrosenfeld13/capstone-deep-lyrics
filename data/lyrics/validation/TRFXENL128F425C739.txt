Words and Music by Michael Reynolds

Sweet blossom grew up on my windowsill
Born on the vine like a morning chill
Left in this world with all the time to kill
Wish I'd never known her, never really known her

Sweet blossom smiled and learned to speak my name
And she spent everyday about the same
Snaking like the devil through my brain
Wish I'd never known her, never really known her

And even now sometimes I still believe
My little flower blooms for only me

Sweet blossom twined herself around my heart
And she said dying was the easy part
If I had listened I'd know where to start
Wish I'd never known her, never really known her

I'd wish I'd never known her, never really known her
Wish I'd never known her, never really known her
