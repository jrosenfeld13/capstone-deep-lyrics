[Verse 1]
I heard you late last night
You know you talk too much
Not everything comes through these walls
But just enough
To hear the things that I don't want to hear


[Verse 2]
I heard you late last night
I wish I had my distance
I hear you crash around and say
That no one listens
I wish that I could hear you say goodnight


[Chorus]
But nobody cares
Especially me
But I can't help myself
As I fall asleep

To turn out the lights
Turn back the sheets
Say goodnight and turn me on
Turn out the lights
Turn back the sheets
Turn me on


[Verse 3]
I heard you late last night
You were in such a hurry
Not a sound behind these walls
Makes me worry
I wish that I would hear you say goodnight

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Say goodnight
Say goodnight
Say goodnight
Say goodnight

[Chorus]


[Outtro]
Yeah yeah

La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la

La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la

Turn out the lights
Turn back the sheets
Turn me on


Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
