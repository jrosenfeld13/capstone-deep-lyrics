See that crocodile walk
Hey, and he lookin' my way
And he got no place to stay
And he feelin' very bad
He got a long way to walk
Lookin' for a home

See the crocodile walk
And it lookin' for its feet
Yeah, and he feels
A heavy meal he's got to eat
He got a long way to walk
Lookin' for a home

Hey, hey, crocodile
Yeah, I wanna see you smile
And, hey, hey, crocodile
Yeah, and I won't be had, had
Had, no
Yeah, crocodile

Hey, hey, crocodile
Yeah, I wanna see you smile
And, hey, hey, crocodile
I wanna stay ahead, 'head

Yeah, and I walk
Head on out through the bar
A-just a feeling in the dark
He make me knock .....
He got a long way to walk
Lookin' for a home
