The evening sky has blown apart
The fire on the hills has all gone grey
My mother's got a few days left
She thinks it's time we all
Learned to pray

My sister's in the kitchen
My brother's laying out his guns
My father's pacing in the hallway
Looks like they've all figured out a way to run

Suffering's gonna come
It's as old as the world
It's as old as the world
Sufferings gonna come to everyone someday
Sufferings gonna come to everyone someday

My mother's gone to glory
I packed my books to a bag
This family is about to explode
I guess I'll try my luck on my own

I know there's life beyond this ridge
We can test the truths that we all know
And value what we keep
But for now
We should all go to sleep

Suffering's gonna come
It's as old as the world
It's as old as the world
Sufferings gonna come to everyone someday
Sufferings gonna come to everyone someday
