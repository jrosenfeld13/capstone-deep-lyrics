I ought to get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me

A younger girl keeps hanging around
One of the loveliest I've ever found
Blowin' my mind, stealin' my heart
Somebody help me 'fore I fall apart

I ought to get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me

The things she's doing keep turning me on
And I've been happy to go right along
I know it's time that I said goodbye
I know I can't leave no matter how hard I try

I ought to get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me
