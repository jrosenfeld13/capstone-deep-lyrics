[Intro]
I gave birth to twin wire hangovers
"Oh, it's like that"
"And yeah"
"Alright, tell us when to go down, pal."
"Go."

[Verse 1]
I gave birth to twin wire hangovers
Now I am a personal space invader
I've got essays, I've got finals due
I have got lots and lots of problems

Look out!
Look out!
Look out!
Look out!

[Verse 2]
How can you put that straw up your nose
When you know how coke is manufactured?
It's made by children for the immature
It's made by babies who've been captured
It's a sin against your fellow man
It's a sin against your fellow man

[Chorus]
Oh, and welcome to this world
Have as much fun as you would like
While helping others have as much fun as you're having
And be kind to those you love
And be kind to those you don't
But for God's sake you gotta be kind!
And respectful because we're all one soul
Be the best fucking human that you can be!

[Outro]
"Sounds like shit."
