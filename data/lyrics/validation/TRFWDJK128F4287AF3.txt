We are too old to cry, too young to die
We're bound to the promise of better lives
We're bought and sold, content to know
That we'll never have to fight if we do what we're told
We are warrior sons but we run from a cause
That brings freedom and purpose and hope to us all
We would rather be a product of the world and its whims
Than have the world be a product of the force of our wills

RISE. And at the sound of our standing the earth will groan
RISE. And we will break their backs

And we will stretch for days and miles and years
Pulled across the fabric of our hopes and fears
We'll pay the price, the sacrifice
Rebels and angels, a storm of white light

Earth shakers, life takers
Passion and purpose makes men of us all
The slow rotting, the cancerous fear
The corruption, we put a stop to it here

Brothers in arms to me!
RISE. And at the sound of our standing the earth will groan
RISE. And we will break their backs with the weight of our will

Give us insurrection
Give us something to say
Give us thirst for vengeance
And we will break their backs with the weight of our will
