It was on the 23rd of June
As I lay blasted in my room
A small bird sang on an ivy branch
And the song they sang was the "Jug of Punch"

Tu-ra-lu-ra-lie, tu-ra-lu-ra-lay
Tu-ra-lu-ra-lie, tu-ra-lu-ra-lay
A small bird sang on an ivy branch
And the song they sang was the "Jug of Punch"

I don't need my junkie friends
All knockin' on my door
I just wanna do an old time waltz
With a buxom Irish whore

Call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon

Call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon

I'll be drinking whiskey in a ditch
With Scruffy, and Brick and Noel
Now I've gone and lost my gear
And I'm looking for my hole

We are Tex's riders
And we come from Nenagh town
One of these nights, durin' one of those fights
Gonna burn the whole place down

Call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon

Call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon

When I die don't bother me
Just dig me a six foot hole
With a candle at my head and feet
And a jar of alcohol

Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon

Call me Paddy Rolling Stone
I've a jug full of Mountain Dew
Just call me Paddy Rolling Stone
When I'm howling at the ceilidh moon
