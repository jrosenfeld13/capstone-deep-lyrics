Young little meat
When I'm down on the street
I'm lookin' at their young little meat
She might be five - she might be ten
I'll take her home and slip it in
Young little piece of meat
You're the youngest you see
I don't f*ckin' care
If you ain't got no c*nt hair
You're young little meat
Young little meat
Hangin' out on Elm Street
You think you're f*ckin' sweet
But you are a piece of meat
Young little meat
Meat
You're young little meat
You might be four - you might be sweet
You might be five - you might be ten
I take it out and slip it in
Young little meat
Young little meat
Young little meat
You're always teasin' me
And when I'm done you will bleed
I'll put you down to the ground
And you'll cry
You wish you never were around
Around
Young little meat
