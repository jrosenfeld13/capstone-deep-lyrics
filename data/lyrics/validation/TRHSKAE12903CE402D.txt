Oh I don't know, oh I don't know, oh I don't know
How you're suppose to relay the complicated message of desire
No I don't know, no I don't know, no I don't know
How to do it when you look at me I look away
With nowhere to go and nothing to say
Lay your hand on me
See if it belongs
We're all tangled up in evolution
We can't work out the simplest of sums
Lay your hand on me
No one could deny
Therein lies the vital information
So elegantly put that it could make you sigh
Everyone knows, everyone knows, everyone knows
That delicate time when all you want is lying beyond your fingertips
But language is hard, language is cold, language is too rude and angular
No no we need another method for our lips
So lay your mouth on mine
No one can deny
Therein lies a friendly explanation
Of how the fundamental laws apply
Lay your mouth on mine
And I won't ask again
If you want to do this one thing for me
No question worth asking will remain
Lay your hand on me
Lay your hand on me
See if it belongs
We're all tangled up in evolution
We can't work out the simplest of sums
Lay your hand on me
No one could deny
Therein lies the vital information
So elegantly put that it could make you sigh
