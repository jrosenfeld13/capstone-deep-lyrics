Whose that woman with the sparkling dress?
A diamond brocade on its chest...
She's a big time woman from way out west...

Automobile, a cozy home, but you always see her all alone...
She's a big time woman from way out west...

Always she treats New York men how to sing...
She's keeps them askin' the same darn thing, all over again...

Every fellow has a winning smile...
But she treats them all just like a child...
