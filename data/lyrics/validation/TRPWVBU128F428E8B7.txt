I think I'll write him a notice...

[Verse 1:]
He lives on the 5th floor
I'm on the 1st floor
Whenever he comes down he hops in his 6'4
K-Ci and JoJo flows out of his window
And I can tell by what he drives he's a fly guy
In my mind he pulls off slow
I'm watching him
Don't know about 12:26
Cause I'm in 1226
I watch him as he comes home
And wonder why he's alone
If he only knew about the girl on level 1

[Chorus:]
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention
If I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And we get more better acquainted
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention
And if I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And p.s. don't forget my extension

[Verse 2:]
I'm getting impatient
And my time is wasting
Should I make the first move before he's taken?
Or maybe he's taken
Oh, I can't take it
I just gotta know about the guy on the 5th floor
And I don't know what to do
I'm lost in my lust for you
We never met, it's true
But I feel like I know you
Can I get through?
Can I make you feel the same way about me as I do, bay?

[Chorus:]
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention. (Tryna get your attention, yeah)
If I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And we get more better acquainted. (We can get more acquainted baby)
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention. (Oh, I'm trying, I'm trying)
And if I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over? (I think I'll write you)
And p.s. don't forget my extension. (A notice)

[Bridge:]
I think I notice everything just by watching you. (Watching you)
Judging by your car, I think your favorite color's blue. (Color's blue)
Same routine everyday
You hit the gym at 2:00. (Gym at 2:00)
I think you'll feel the same once we're properly introduced. (Introduced)
It's this face you make everytime something's wrong. (Something's wrong)
Before you go to bed you take two shots of Patron. (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everynight you fall asleep with the T.V. on. (Ohhh)
I don't know why you're alone

[Chorus:]
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention
If I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And we get more better acquainted
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention
And if I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And p.s. don't forget my extension

[Chorus:]
I think I'll write him a notice, a notice
So he can notice that I'm trying to get his attention
If I write you a notice, a notice can you come on over?
And we get more better acquainted
