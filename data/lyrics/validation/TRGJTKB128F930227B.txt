Well I think it all happened, when I was three years old
The running man showed me a step, that made me loose control
So I used it as a boy... and when I grew up...
I never thought this running motion would bring me such luck
So I skanked it in the morning and I skanked it in the night
It was then I decided that SKA would be my life
It cheered me up and it made me feel good
When it comes to skankin' I think that everyone should
I recall this girl I knew, she always seemed so sad and blue
She never ever skanked this was and look at where she is today
She would say I was retarded and that would leave me brokenhearted
'Til I faced reality and I realized this girl was not for me!
So I skanked it in the mornin'... I skanked it in the night...
And when I was done I was feeling alright
You say I have to change, well what's with that?
You say to come inside but there's no welcome mat
Will this game we're always playin' ever end
But would you want it, if in the end we'd just be freinds
Lookin' through the mirror
