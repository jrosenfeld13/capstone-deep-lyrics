[Verse 1]
As soon as you are able
Woman I am willing
To make the break that we
Are on the brink of
My cup is on the table
Our love is spilling
Waiting here for you to
Take and drink of

[Chorus]
So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Yeah, whoo

[Verse 2]
I knew it had to happen
Felt the tables turnin'
Got me through my darkest hour
I heard the thunder clappin'
Felt the desert burnin'
Until you poured on me
Like a sweet sunshower

[Chorus]
So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh yeah
Whoo

[Chorus]
So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, baby, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Baby, roll with the changes
Oh, you know, you know, you know you got to

[Bridge]
Keep on rollin' (Oh yeah)
Keep on rollin'
Oh, roll with the changes
(Keep on rollin') Keep on rollin' (Oh yeah)
Keep on rollin'
Oh, now roll with the changes
(Oh baby) Keep on rollin' (Oh baby)
Keep on rollin'
Oh, you've got to learn to roll with the changes
(Got to, got to, got to, got to)
Keep on rollin'
(Got to keep on)
Keep on rollin'
Oh, you've got to learn to
Got to learn to
Got to learn to roll

[Outro]
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
