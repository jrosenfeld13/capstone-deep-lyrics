Once the light has turned my face
Into the look of a dying grace
Displaying what I'm supposed to be
But it's not me

Watching me from behind the glass
Through contenting eyes from the past
Cold, beneath my dignity
But it's not me

Rejecting that I am the one
Knowing that myself has gone
To the other side of the mirror
And getting bigger
What is left to my side
Perhaps my aim, perhaps my pride
Smiling through the other side of the mirror
Still getting bigger

It's not me
