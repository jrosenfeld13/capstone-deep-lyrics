I feel it is hidden in your eyes
And it speaks to me like dreams at night
So the tale will be told
I know, it was clear right from the start
That the road was paved with misery
Oh it's worth it, you'll see

We're taken by the wind
The waves of fate, forcefully
Let our weary souls be one

Like a smile from heaven's eye
It's a flame that will never die
In my dreams you are glorious

It's late, but I cannot close my eyes
I've been seeing such a tragedy
It's been hunting my dreams
But I know, since you walked into my life
That the sun has shed a different light
I'll remember, for life

And as we're taken by the wind
The waves of fate, forcefully
Let our weary souls unite

Like a smile from heaven's eye
You're the flame that will never die
You're the heart of the rising storm
It's in the stars that commence the fall
Like a dream that you can't recall
Without you it all fades away
My soul, you are so glorious

Like a smile from heaven's eye
You're the flame that will never die
In my dreams you are glorious
My soul, you are glorious
