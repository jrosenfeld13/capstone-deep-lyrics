Well, here's a love song but I don't care
No, I don't care 'bout it
'Cause I don't fall for it, yeah
No, I don't fall for it

Well, I'm so tired but I don't understand
'Cause I slept twelve hours last night
I can't keep my eyes open, yeah
I can't get things right

Well, if you want me maybe let me know
'Cause I'm so done with feeling low
And If you want me maybe let me go
'Cause I can't take this torture no more

La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it, don't kid yourself, no
La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it
La la la la la la lo

Most love stories go on and on
But this one's short and sweet
I don't want no encore, yeah
This one's short and sweet

Well, I don't want you
You don't want me
That's what I think
Maybe it's me

Well, if you want me maybe let me know
'Cause I'm so done with feeling low
And if you want me maybe let me go
'Cause I can't take this torture no more

La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it, don't kid yourself, no
La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it
La la la la la la lo

Well, now it's gone and I am so low
What is love if we don't know anyhow?
Is it just the things that we think, we think of?
Is it just the things that we're told to dream of?

Well, let's kicks some rocks so what? You know what
Late from the start with two broken hearts
Well, let's kicks some rocks so what? You know what
Late from the start with two broken hearts

Well, If you want me maybe let me know
'Cause I'm so done with feeling low
And if you want me maybe let me go
'Cause I can't take this torture no more

La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it, don't kid yourself, no
La la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it
La la la la la la lo
