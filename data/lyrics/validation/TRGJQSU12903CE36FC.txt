[Chorus]
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Sure good looking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Always cooking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

[Verse 1]
You couldn't call him handsome
But he's loaded with style
Always wears a t-shirt
And a great big smile
Something 'bout this crazy kid
We all love so
When he's around
The girls all holler, Daddy-o

[Chorus]
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Sure good looking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Always cooking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

[Verse 2]
He's got a big convertible
Fire engine red
Howling and a-prowling
Never goes to bed
He's really Mister Big
To all the kids in school
Everybody knows that
Daddy-O's real cool

[Chorus]
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Sure good looking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Always cooking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

[Verse 3]
You never have to see him
To know that he's around
He's got a set of horns
With the craziest sound
The girls start to jiving
When they hear him blow
They all jump and holler
Here comes Daddy-O

[Chorus]
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Sure good looking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Always cooking
Daddy-o (Daddy-o)
Ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

[Outro]
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o
(Daddy-o, Daddy-o)
(Daddy-o, Daddy-o)
(Daddy-o, Daddy-o)
