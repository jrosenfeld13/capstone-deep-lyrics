My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark (x2)

I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
When I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days (days)

Now someone's on the telephone
Desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor
Doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom

But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
Yeah but I'll tell you...

My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be...
(By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn
For the Prince of Darkness any longer)

Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
And he almost pulled me under (under)

Now someone's on the telephone
Desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor
Doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom

But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
Yeah but I'll tell you...

My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be...
(By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn
For the Prince of Darkness any longer)
