[Spoken Intro]
Je suis prte
Vous tes prt aussi?

[Verse]
Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Don't give me one of your lines

[Chorus 1]
Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

[Post-Chorus]
Are you just being kind? (no)
Am I losing my mind? (losing your mind)
Oh no baby (yeah)

[Verse]
Are you wasting my time? (wasting my time)
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time? (time, time, time)
Are you just being kind?
Don't go give me one of your lines

[Chorus 1]
Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

[Modified Post-Chorus]
Ooh, are you just being kind?
Am I losing my mind?
Don't (wait)

[Bridge]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run
Seem to have all the fun
But am I wasting my time? (she's so fine)
Are you just being kind? (no)

[Chorus 2]
Come try to tell me what your enemies told you
Show them now how I didn't do you wrong
That this is not a love song

[Post-Chorus]
Are you just being kind (no)
Am I losing my mind (losing your mind)
Oh no baby (oh yeah)

[Verse]
Are you wasting my time? (wasting my time)
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time? (time, time, time)
Are you just being kind?
Don't go give me one of your lines

[Modified Chorus 1]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
That's how I feel
Don't fog my mind (don't fog)
Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh are you just being kind (embrasse-moi) (what)
Am I losing my mind (pour la dernire fois)
Love song, love song

[Modified Chorus 2]
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know (love song)
That this is not a love song that I want to sing
