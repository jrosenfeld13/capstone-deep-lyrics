[Verse 1]
And when I see you, I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around, turns you around
If you feel discouraged that there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams
From absorbing everything, the spectrums A to Z

[Verse 2]
This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years
All the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone to call at 7:03
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late, I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay

[Outro]
This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years
