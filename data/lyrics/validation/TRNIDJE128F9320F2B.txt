I been drinkin all day
And day before
When i get sober
Ain't gonna drink no more

Well they'll call you sugar
And they'll call you pie
They'll take all your money
Call you country guy

Gonna move to Kansas City, sure as your born
Gonna move to Kansas City, sure as your born
Gonna move babe, sugar where they don't 'low you
No they don't, no they don't

Walkin down fifth street, twenty-nine Vale
Lookin' for that woman that sell cocaine

Gonna move to Kansas City, sure as your born
Gonna move to Kansas City, sure as your born
Gonna move babe, sugar where they don't 'low you
No they don't, no they don't
