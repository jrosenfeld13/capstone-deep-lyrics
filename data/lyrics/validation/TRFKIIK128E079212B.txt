[Verse]
Take off those working clothes
Put on these high heeled shoes
Don't want no preacher on the TV baby
Don't want to hear the news
Shut out the world behind us
Put on your long black dress
No one's ever going to find us here
Just leave your hair in a mess
I've been searching long enough
I begged the moon and the stars above

[Chorus]
For sacred love

[Verse 3]
I've been up, I've been down
I've been lonesome, in this godless town
You're my religion, you're my church
You're the holy grail at the end of my search
Have I been down on my knees for long enough?
I've been searching the planet to find

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The spirit moves on the water
She takes the shape of this heavenly daughter
She's rising up like a river in flood
The word got made into flesh and blood
The sky grew dark, and the earth she shook
Just like a prophecy in the Holy Book
Thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not doubt that this love is real
So I got down on my knees and I prayed to the skies
When I looked up could I trust my eyes?
All the saints and angels and the stars up above
They all bowed down to the flower of creation
Every man every woman
Every race every nation
It all comes down to this

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Don't need no doctor, don't need no pills
I got a cure for the country's ills
Here she comes like a river in flood
The word got made into flesh and blood
Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill
But if you don't love her your best friend will
All the saints up in heaven and the stars up above
It all comes down, it all comes down
It all comes down to love

[Bridge]
Take off your working clothes
Put on your long black dress
And your high heeled shoes
Just leave your hair in a mess

[Outro]
I've been thinking about religion
I've been thinking about the things that we believe
I've been thinking about the Bible
I've been thinking about Adam and Eve
I've been thinking about the garden
I've been thinking about the tree of knowledge, and the tree of life
I've been thinking about forbidden fruit
I've been thinking about a man and his wife
I been thinking about, thinking about
Sacred love, sacred love
