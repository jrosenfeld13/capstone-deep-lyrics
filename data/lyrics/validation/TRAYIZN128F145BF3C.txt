How can I review to you?
No other words just stamped in through
A thousand miles but not too far to see
The day will come for all so pleasantly

A better way
A better way

Half the things have not been said
When the days go by in times ahead
A thousand miles but not too far to see
The day will come for all so pleasantly

A better way
A better way

And all the time
Enriched in style
Shines on me
Like a billion smiles
(billion smiles)

And all the time
Enriched in style
Shines on me
Like a billion smiles
(billion smiles)

Every way you book's a mess
Seems like fate won't work for us
A thousand miles but not too far to see
The day will come for all so pleasantly

A better way
A better way

And all the time
Enriched in style
Shines on me
Like a billion smiles
(billion smiles)

And all the time
Enriched in style
Shines on me
Like a billion smiles
(billion smiles)
(billion smiles)
(billion smiles)
