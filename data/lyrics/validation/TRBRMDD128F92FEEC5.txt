Hey everybody wherever you are
There's a new way of talking and it's gonna go far;
You take the letters in the words
Turn 'em all around; you say the last ones first
And you check out the sound
Talk Backwards

I know what you're thinking;
That sounds strange
You've talked forward so long that it's hard to change
But it's just like metric once you get the drift
You twist your tongue and you give your palate a lift
You take your favorite phrase
And you read it in the mirror
Practice that about a half a year
And then sdrawkcab gnikiat mi em ta kool
You're a regular talking bassackwards fool
Talk backwards

Talking backwards is sweeping the nation
Talking backwards is the new sensation
You amaze your friends when you start to rap
Don't say pass the butter, say rettub eht ssap
Rettub eht ssap? Rettub eht ssap
And if you're out with a girl and she's a little bit shy
Don't say I love you; say Uoy evol I
Uoy evol I and I always will
Now see if that doesn't take off the chill
Talk Backwards

The other day now I was walking down the street
There's this little girl I thought I'd like to meet
I said excuse me miss but
Sserd taht teg uoy erehw. thgin ta tuo emoc
Yeht srats ekil era hteet ruoy
And I said am I getting through to you yet
She said you're a gent in the first degree
And I love it when you talk backwards to me
Talk backwards

Never can tell, one of these nights
Those who talk backwards will demand their rights
They'll rise up angry and get a solution
In the form of an amendment to the constitution
That guarantees 'em freedom of reverse elocution;
And then every T.V. show that airs
Will have to be captioned for the forward impaired
Talk backwards
Talk backwards
Talk backwards
Talk backwards
