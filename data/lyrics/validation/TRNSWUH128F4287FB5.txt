[Intro]
Stone love
Stoned in love again
So in love

[Verse 1]
You say that
You wanna
Be mine and
You're gonna
Feel love
You never felt before

This is the
Beginning
Of love with
No ending
True love
That time cannot erase

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl I've waited for)
All night for love to find the place
(Cause I make that soul)
Soul sacrifice our lovin' will sustain

[Chorus]
Girl you got me stoned in love (Stone love)
I'm stoned in love again
Oh you got me so so stoned
So in love (Pretty baby, give it to me baby)

Girl you got me stoned in love (Stone love)
I'm stoned in love again
Ah you got me so so stoned
Yeah, so in love (Pretty baby, give it to me baby)

[Verse 2]
And you're
So special
You're someone
I treasure
No one
Can ever take your place

Let's stay here
Together
To make love here
Forever
True love
Time cannot erase

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl I've waited for)
All night (For love to find a place)
(Cause I make that soul)
Soul sacrifice our love will sustain

[Chorus]
Girl you got me stoned in love (Stone love)
I'm stoned in love again
Ah you got me so so stoned
So in love (Pretty baby, give it to me baby)
