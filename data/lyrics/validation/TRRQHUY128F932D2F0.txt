Oooh this hot summer has got me down again
Fry an egg on the street
Heatwaves are wiggling on the sidewalk
Cops are dropping like flies on the beat
I need a new lover to take me in
Protect me from this humid air
Be you from brooklyn, staten island or queens
I don't care

It don't matter kinda lovin' you're into
Or how big your apartment might be
All you need's an air conditioner
And you're the man for me

You can pour me a glass of Perrier
You can fan my fevered brow
You can rub me down with alcohol
But ain't enough know how

You can lay me in a tub of ice
You can stand me in a cold shower, too
But if you don't have an air conditioner
I will not go home with you

It don't matter kinda lovin' you're into
Or how big your ego might be
All you need's an air conditioner
And you are the man
You are the man
You are the man
You are my man
You are the man for me

Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Buh buh buh badadadada
Aooh aooh

What's that you say?
You live by the Hudson river?
And a breeze blows through your door?
Well, honey, if you don't have
A freidrich's in your window
I don't want to hear anymore

You say you live in a penthouse
You got a terrace with a view of the night
Well, that's swell
But I really must tell you
An air conditioner is a much prettier sight

It don't matter kinda lovin' you're into
Or how big your wallet might be
All you need's an air conditioner
And you're the man oh
You're the man

I don't care what kinda lovin' you're into
Or how big your ... might be
All you need's an air conditioner
And you're the man oh
You're the man oh
You're the man for me

Bada dah dah dah dah
