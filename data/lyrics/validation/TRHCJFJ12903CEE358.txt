You'll be gone when the dawn comes tomorrow
You'll be far, far away out at sea
So I give you this croce di oro
It will bring you home safely to me

Ev'ry hour we're apart will be sorrow
In the chapel a candle will burn
Take my love and this croce di oro
I will pray for you till you return

My darling, my darling, my darling
Do you see that star in the blue?

Each night I will give it a message
And the star will give it to you

Till we meet on that far-off tomorrow
May the Good Lord be with you and then
With the help of this croce di oro
You'll be back in my arms once again

With the help of this croce di oro
You'll be back in my arms once again (croce di oro)
