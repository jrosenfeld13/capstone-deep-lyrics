Well I been lookin' pretty hard at our time now
And I been thinkin' 'bout the things that you did
If you come back again, you'd better not leave me
It isn't hard to find a girl who can give
Well I been thinkin' pretty hard 'bout it lately
I tried to let you know just what you mean to me

Too many long for yesterday
But yesterday's over
So many things we couldn't say
But yesterday's over

Well I been findin' pretty hard to believe how
I've no regrets or advice to give
And my reflection don't recognise me now
Must be a symptom of the way that I live
Well I been goin' up high, far and low now
I tried to let you know just what you mean to me

Too many long for yesterday
But yesterday's over
So many things we couldn't say
But yesterday's over

I don't even know what you say half the time
Lookin' back at you, shoulda seen a dead end sign

Too many long for yesterday
But yesterday's over
So many things we couldn't say
But yesterday's over

Too many long for yesterday
But yesterday's over
So many things we couldn't say
But yesterday's over
