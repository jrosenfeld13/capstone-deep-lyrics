It's the things that you miss
When you just seem to miss it
It's the hard times, hard times
It's the simple little kiss
When you don't want to kiss me
It's the hard times, hard times

I could fall for something sane
My cuts are bleeding napalm
I could fall for something sane
I am just a time-bomb

I got a bone to pick with all but my own business
Hard times, hard times
It's the Mr. Silhouette that's behind every summit
It's the hard times, hard times

I could fall for something sane
My cuts are bleeding napalm
I could fall for something sane
I am just a time-bomb

It's the same old step and
The same old step and song
You got me tickin' like a timebomb
The same old step and
The same old step and song
You got me tickin' like a timebomb
Like a timebomb... like a timebomb

I could fall for something sane
My cuts are bleeding napalm
I could fall for something sane
I am just a time-bomb

It's the same old step and
The same old step and song
You got me tickin' like a timebomb
The same old step and
The same old step and song
You got me tickin' like a timebomb
Like a timebomb... like a timebomb
