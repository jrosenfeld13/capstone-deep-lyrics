Birds, birds everywhere I see
I wanna live like they do
I wanna be in their trees
So heavenly

Bird, birds everywhere I go
I wanna know what they know
I wanna live in harmony
So simply

Dear God, I know sometime I'm gonna die
And when I do I hope you'll give me one more try
Up in the sky with those

Birds, birds everywhere I turn
Looking down there's no boundaries
Looking down there's no countries
No misery

Dear God, I know sometime I'm gonna die
And when I do I hope you'll give me one more try
Up in the sky with those

Birds, birds everywhere I see
I wanna live like they do
I wanna be in their trees
So free
