My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is "bring it on"
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

Ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me
