[Verse 1]
I tip my cap to the heavy heavy rain
I wave hello when I see a snake go by
I ain't a fighter, never been in a fight
Can't get no answers from the other guy

[Chorus]
So let's just clear the air
I am over here, I'm over there

[Verse 2]
I am the youngest of a family of spiders
I got a web of my very own weaving
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna beat it
So I ain't going home just because I'm leaving

[Chorus]
So let's just clear the air
I am over here, I'm over there

[Verse 3]
Well the last time that I got lonely
I didn't even know your name
Once and again for the first time
Yeah it's old but it ain't the same
I remember everything you told me
I remember you walking away
I felt it on the moment that I met you
And that felt like a place that I should stay

[Chorus]
So let's just clear the air
I am over here, I'm over there

[Verse 4]
We were around long before my birthday
We'll be around to throw flowers at my grave
Me and you got a history of history
Me and you, two continuous waves

[Chorus]
So let us feel the air
We are over here, we're over there
We are over here, we're over there

So let us feel the air
We are over here, we're over there

We're over here
We're over there

We're over here
We're over there
