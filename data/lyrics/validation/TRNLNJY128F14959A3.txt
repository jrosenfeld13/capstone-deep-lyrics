I got on my wheels and I went out on the town draggin'
I hit a big oak tree it looked like a wreck to the wagon
I got a hospital bill and the judge a waitin' for me to pay
I had a sweet little honey just two six packs away
I told the judge there was two trees and I went 'tween 'em
He said from what I hear your condition that's the way that you seen 'em
He laid down a hammer and he gave me ninety long days
And I had a sweet little honey just two six packs away

Well I'm workin' on a country road but it's sunny weather
It's gonna take a while to put my wheels back together
Now Sunday rolls around that's my cigarette day
And my baby's still a waitin' just two six packs away
When I get out of this place and don't say I never saw one
Goin' down to Joe's and have that big bartender draw one
For my throat is dry and my mouth feels like day
And my baby is a waitin' just two six packs away
And my baby is a waitin' just two six packs away
And my baby is a waitin' just two six packs away
