[Verse 1]
Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey
You would call it a perfect day
And naturally I'd have to agree, if you were here with me

[Verse 2]
When I'm hanging out with all my friends
Something still holds back my smile
Something tells me they're the enemy, the enemy
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

[Chorus]
And I know she was everything
When everybodys having fun
I sit and stare at everyone
Back to myself again

[Verse 3]
I took a walk outside along the beach
Watch the waves roll along the shore
The things I felt aren't there anymore, not anymore
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

[Chorus]
And everybodys having fun
But not me
I sit and stare at everyone
Back to myself again

[Outro]
Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey
Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about
Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about her
