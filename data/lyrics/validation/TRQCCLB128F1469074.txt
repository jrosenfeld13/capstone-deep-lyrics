Your two eyes got too close to be framed
When I can't see I can't say
You rushed in with the weather in your hair
And my perspective's changed
And the landscape's like an overcoat
And my thoughts are like rain
There's no one queuing up to take your place
Now, you're gone again
I left for somewhere south of her pretty hair
Out there all alone, it's a wilderness
But I'm coming back for her
Careering down the same old road
On the wrong side of town
Its 12.30 and the bare walls like semaphore
Say this apartment's closed down
And the landscape's like an overcoat
And my thoughts are like rain
Her two eyes got too close to fit the frame
I left for somewhere south of her pretty hair
Out there all alone, it's a wilderness
But I'm coming back for her
I'd be the first to admit my doubt
But you just say somewhere
Well, I pulled the words from your mouth
But you just say somewhere
I pulled a flame out of your mouth
But you just say somewhere
'Cause I'd be the first to admit my doubt
But you just say somewhere south
