Never dared to have your arms around me
Not that I considered it a sin
But tonight I want your arms around me
It's the mood that I'm in

Can it be the music that they're playin'
Or the magic of the violin
That intrigues my heart to obeyin'
It's the mood that I'm in

Maybe it's the cocktail that I'm sippin'
Tonight I'm so romantically inclined
So speak to me of love
In words so tender

Let the rhapsody of life begin
I could give my heart in sweet surrender
It's the mood I'm in
