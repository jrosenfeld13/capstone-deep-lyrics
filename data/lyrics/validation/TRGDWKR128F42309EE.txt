Everybody get on your feet
You make me nervous when youre in your seat
Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doing a dance that can't be beat

We're barefootin', barefootin', barefootin', barefootin'

Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
She threw her wig and her high sneakers too
She's doing a dance without any shoes

She's barefootin', barefootin', barefootin', yeah, she's barefootin'

Hey, little girl with the red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away
Come back and get them another day

Barefootin', barefootin', yeah, yeah, barefootin', yeah, barefootin'

Oh, lil' John Henry, he said to Sue
If I can barefoot, you can barefoot too
Sue told John : I can get out here and groove
I been barefootin ever since I was two

Barefootin', barefootin', yeah, she's barefootin', yeah, barefootin'

Take off your shoes and dance

(Barefootin ooh-ooh, barefootin' ooh-ooh, barefootin' ooh-...)
Take off your shoes and dance
(Barefootin ooh-ooh, barefootin' ooh-ooh, barefootin' ooh-...)
