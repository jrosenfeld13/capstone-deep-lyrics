Sitting burden on the office chair
Empty mind, empty bank account
If this is your piece, your piece is a mess to me

Hundreds killed on the internet
Life delete, all is set
If this is your truth, your truth is a mess to me

If common sense means no control
You've got it all
If common sense means no control
You've got it all, you've got it
If common sense means no control
You've got it all
If common sense means no control

Sitting choking on the office chair
Empty mind, empty bank account
If this is your piece, your prophet is piece to me

Thousands killed on the internet
Life delete, all is set
If this is your truth, your truth is a mess to me
Yeah

If common sense means no control
You've got it all
If common sense means no control
You've got it all, you've got it
If common sense means no control
You've got it all
If common sense means no control
You've got it
You've got it

Love your money, love your money
Love your money, love your money

Love your money, love your money
Love your money, love your money
