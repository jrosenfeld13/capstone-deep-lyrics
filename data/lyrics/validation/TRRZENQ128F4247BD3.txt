Pretty little china girl
Tiny oriental pearl
Hold me in your dragon magic
Willow pattern smile

How does it feel?
Is it unreal?
And the other side of the plane
Pieces of my heart somewhere
Locked inside your raven hair
Won't you love me?
Don't you care?
Need that love, yeah
But you're just walking away
I'll see you some other day
On some other planet

Pretty china girl
Pretty china girl
I'm ah dig on you
Pretty china girl
I'm ah dig on you

Puffy diamond, dribbling eyes
Sitting in your sun blast skies
Fly me just one sunrise of your China painted land

Paradise but delicate wild, like snow
Shelters in its own mess
Burning leaves, the trees unfurled
Of emptyness and naked world
That falls around our mellow herd
Like you disparing, fading into your sun
I don't know what you've not won
Or how much i'm bleeding

Pretty china girl
Pretty china girl
I'm ah dig on you
Pretty china girl
I'm ah dig on you

China girl,China girl
China girl,China girl
China girl,China girl
China girl
