Believe you me the price is clear
A child born the mother near
To death and life as hand in hand
A failed life exposed the man
Who led her off into the flame
To cast her back to hell again

But hear you me the break of dawn
Will wash away the sins thereof
Unto the lake beyond the tree
The child waits alone is he

The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
