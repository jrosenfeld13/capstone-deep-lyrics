The only thing that he feared was God
He was tough as nails, he didn't spare the rod
'Cause he loved us kids, yeah he did

He raised us up straight and strong
Said be your own man, don't you tag along with the wrong crowd
He said, listen now

Don't you let nobody tell you what you need to do
Just listen to that voice that's talkin' deep inside of you, sayin'

Don't sell out, don't you compromise
If it's something you believe in, son you may have to fight
But you can't go wrong when you're doin' what's right

Well, things have changed in the world today
No black and white just shades of gray and we know it ain't right
Taking pills to sleep at night

My old man still lives in me
And I'm seeing things that he said I'd see
But I won't give in 'cause I remember when

He told me not to live my life for anybody else
Son, the only thing you have to do is answer to yourself, sayin'

Don't sell out, don't you compromise
If it's something you believe in, son you may have to fight
But you can't go wrong when you're doin' what's right

He said, it may be the hardest thing you'll ever have to do
And if anybody's got your back it'll be a precious few, sayin'

Don't sell out, don't you compromise
If it's something you believe in, son you may have to fight
But you can't go wrong when you're doin' what's right

He said you can't go wrong when you're doin' what's right
When you're doin' what's right
Son, you can't go wrong when you're doin' what's right
He said you can't go wrong
