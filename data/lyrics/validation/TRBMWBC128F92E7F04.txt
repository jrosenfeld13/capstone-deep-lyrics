Good Luck, Bad Luck
It's all invisible tides of highways
Don't ya think, Charlie?
It's all random shit like waves
I don't believe in luck, do you?
Yeah, Fuck you Charlie
Across this country filled
With islands of disappointment
We seek family, we find augeries they say:
Stop your crying, keep on driving
Things will be better in California!
You like to play it safe
But you want what you paid for
I can't stand California!
The next day changing tires
We attract the usual flies and homeless
And it's 'cigarettes and change man?'
Consequences that await you
Bad faith you're pushing West
You can't outrun or let run over you
I won't stoop to prayer
'cause the physics were already there
When Charlie wished us luck saying, you

Stop your crying, keep on driving
Things will be better in California
I'm sure we had our reasons
But I can't recall them
I can't stand California

Yeah, foundations can never be relain
And anyway its always too late for weak hearts who won't, decide
So, don't stop when you hit the ocean
Panicked ants on the coast of slow motion
I smell a dream dying, die dream die
The rotted rind of this rotted country
Rots in the West and its beyond me
Why anyone would look there for anything unless

You don't care what you're finding
Is blank and confining
There are no answers in California
You're dumb enough to move there
Than you belong there
I can't stand California
Stop your crying, keep on driving
Stop looking to California
All your reasons are cheap and see-through and
I can't stand California
