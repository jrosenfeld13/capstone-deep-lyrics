A row of mirrors before me and i can't see my reflection
My life is so far is far from my expectations
It's getting lonely in this parking lot of life
I guess my punishment is my salvation
I wish i could find a way to roam
Driving home always gives me the blues
Singing songs about what i feel like inside
Keeps me coming back for more
It's getting lonely in this parking lot of life
I guess my punishment is my salvation
I tread the thin line
You don't know who to follow home your life is so far
Is far from your expectations
It's getting lonely with this parking lot of life
