CHORUS
Jesus, You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do
Jesus, You're the center of my joy

VERSE 1
When I've lost my direction
You're the compass for my way
You're the fire and light
When nights are long and cold
In sadness, You're my laughter
That shatters all my fears
When I'm all alone, Your hand is there to hold

CHORUS

VERSE 2
You are why I find pleasure
In the simple things in life
You're the music in the meadows and the streams
The voices of the children, my family, and home
You're the source and finish of my highest dreams

VAMP
Jesus, You are the center of my joy

ENDING
Jesus, You are the center of my joy
Joy, of my joy
