And you can tell it take it to someone who cares
Tell it take it to someone else
I revel in my inabilities
But big daddy knows best
Always eyes and ears glossed over
Until it passes at some point, someday

So I play dumb and I pretend
Because it's so much better than being dragged into an argument
And being told that I don't understand

Tell it take it to someone who cares

It must be nice to have that certainty in every single thing you say
I was never sure of what direction to take
So many ways (so many ways)

I chose simplicity for a change, guess how many friends I made!

So I play dumb and I pretend
Because it's so much better than being dragged into an argument
And being told that I don't understand anything;
Anything at all
The one thing I know is that you care and I do not
Do not!

(You're probably right but I'm to stupid to care)
