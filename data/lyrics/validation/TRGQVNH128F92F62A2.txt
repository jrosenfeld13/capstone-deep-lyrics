[Verse 1]
Every week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8am's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up
Everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (go, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends, and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up
Everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (go, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up
Everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up
Everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (go, oh, oh)
