Okay

I'm coming a-round
I'm coming around for her
I follow a-round
I follow around for her
Yeah I'm coming right down
I'm coming right down, down, down, down
Let me at it cuz

I'll swallow it down
I'll swallow it down for her
And I'll swear it a-round
I'll swear it around for her
Yeah I'll swallow it down
I'll turn the lights down, down, down, down
Forget about it cuz

Shes not okay
Turn out the lights
I feel so good
Dim out tonight
It takes two
The other side
Come on savior
Go on and hide

I'm feeling a-round
I'm feeling around for her
And I'm wandering 'round
I'm stumbling around, the dark
But I'll follow it down
I'll follow it down, down, down, down
Forget about it cuz

Set it up
Well pull it down
No body here
Were all alone
Silent Night
Turn out the lights
Well now or never
Ready for love
The time is now
Nobody 'round
I feel somethin'
Turn out tonight
I'll take you to
The other side
Come on savoir
I wanna go down down
Wanna go down down
Wanna go!

I'll tear it up
I'll pull it down
Come on savoir
Were not alone
Dead light
Turn out the lights
Now or never
Ready for love
The time is now
No one to ask
I feel someone
Ready tonight
I'll take you to
The other side
Can't stop this fever
I wanna go down down
Wanna go down down
Wanna go!
