From a fast paced 'with wire taps
As I inspire'
Please don't flash and reach for the mic
When this booky down fast, sound the sound check
Clowns ready to click, they call it cheat around
But hands down, I'm the man now
Some fans clown, now they stand around with '
Kills beats, keep it real street'
Getting plenty stacks'don't give me crap
My mind's intact, rhymes are fat, lines are packed with all kinds of stacks
'don't beg for dough, let you know'
Technology is how I display my ways
Electric output got mad scientist pondering for days
Week and then years, how other do, do this
Break 'em down to tears for fears, full light, dancing through the night
Listen to the beats'bills I must pay, never enough time'
All in all, God, why me?
Why I gotta think this way?
Why does injustice hurt all day?
Please, God, take it away
I beg you, I plead, I pray
Some say I shouldn't be this way
A man with no religion is still respected
True living
I respect the birth that God has given 'cause God has wisdom
Weirdest thing to call rap music
