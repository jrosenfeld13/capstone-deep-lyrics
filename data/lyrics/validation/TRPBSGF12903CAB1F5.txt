(Verse 1)
I ain't lookin' for trouble
I'm just lookin' to cheat
Don't push me, man
'Cause I can get real mean

(Pre-chorus)
When you leave the house
Be Ready!
For you know not the hour that I come
So, be ready!
In the city, you can carry a gun

(Chorus)
So show me your teeth!
And cover your neck!
Oh, meat-eatin' girl
They make the best pets!

(Verse 2)
Heard you're searchin' for favors
Well, don't call on me
In control of it all
You were well deceived. HAH!

(Pre-chorus)
When you leave the house
Be Ready!
For you know not the hour that I come
So, be ready!
In the city, you can carry a gun

(Chorus)
So show me your teeth!
And cover your neck!
Oh, meat-eatin' girl
They make the best pets!

(Verse 3)
For corset house-girls
Are what you've become
No hand-me-down harlots
Who gonna give him none

(Verse 4/Middle 8/Lift)
So, I'm buildin' it
Display that all the heavens
Will make beggars cry
Held it up, brace it like a hammer
Leader of the claw

(Bridge/Solo)
So show me your teeth!

(Chorus)
So show me your teeth!
And cover your neck!
Oh, meat-eatin' girl
They make the best pets!

Oh, show me your teeth!

(Outro)
So show me your teeth!
