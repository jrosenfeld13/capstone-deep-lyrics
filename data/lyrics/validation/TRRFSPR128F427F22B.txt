[Verse 1]
Too many mornings, been lost there somehow
Put your head on my shoulder, wipe sweat from my brow
And it feels like I'm fallin', somewhere a voice was callin'
That all things start anew, for you, for you, for you

[Verse 2]
Now you got a blue notion, so bittersweet
But one stolen moment, could make it complete
But I'm gettin' weary, so say to me clearly
That maybe it came true, for you, for you, for you

[Verse 3]
I remember what you said, love can't be denied
And that nothing is sacred, but for what is inside
Well my mind starts to wonder, for your love I will hunger
Till I can make it through, for you, for you, for you
