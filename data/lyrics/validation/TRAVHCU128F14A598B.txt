I am trying to read your mind
We have stopped to smell the roses
I am trying not to lose mine
The roses or my mind

You are going to break my heart
I can see it in your eyes and I can
Feel it when the rain starts
Falling with my heart

I will watch the rain fall harder
I will stay and you will go
I won't beg and I won't barter
I won't say I told you so

Oh, oh

You are stringing me along
You'll pretend that you're not going
Try and comfort me but you're gone
And there's another song

And this is better after all
I will keep the holy sweater
Tend the roses when the leaves fall
It's better after all

I will watch the rain fall harder
I will stay and you will go
I won't beg and I won't barter
I won't say I told you so

Oh, oh

I am trying to read your mind
You are going to break my heart
You are stringing me along
And this is better after all
Yeah this is better after all
It's better after all
