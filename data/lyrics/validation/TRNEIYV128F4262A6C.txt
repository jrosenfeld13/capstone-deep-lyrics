[Verse 1]
I had given up on you 'cause you have made it clear
You couldn't give a damn whether I was far, I was near
But  you heard I got a man and suddenly you're here
The challenges must turn you on 'cause I know you ain't sincere

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What we had is over, even though I thought we'd last
But somehow you just think that you can hold on to the past
You hated that I'm doing fine without you in my life
But I bet you'd never guessed that I'd be someone else's wife

[Chorus 1]
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Yeah, you had your fun
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
'Cause you're not the one (you're not the one)

[Verse 2]
Lately in the middle of the nights you decide to call
You're telling me you want me back and that I am your all
Ever since we parted, those three little words you refused to say
Are said to me so sweetly almost every single day

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no use in lying 'cause I really love my man
There's no use in trying 'cause I can see right through your plan
It's time that you move on and make yourself a brand new start
But I wouldn't be surprised if next time someone breaks your heart

[Chorus 1]
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Yeah, you had your fun
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
'Cause you're not the one (you're not the one)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no use in lying 'cause I really love my man
There's no use in trying 'cause I can see right through your plan
It's time that you move on and make yourself a brand new start
But I wouldn't be surprised if next time someone breaks your heart

[Chorus 2]
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Yeah, you had your fun
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
'Cause you're not the one (you're not the one)
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Yeah, you had your fun
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
(You're not the one)
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
'Cause you're not the one
When you see me, bet you love me
Then you leave me, played your games
Yeah, you had your fun
Boy, believe me
If you think I still need you
Boy, you're wrong
'Cause you're not the one...
