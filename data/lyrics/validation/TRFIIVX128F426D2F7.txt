You know you shook me
You shook me all night long
(You wouldn't turn me loose)
Whoa, you shook me, pretty mama
You shook me all night long
(Couldn't rest a bit)
Whoa, you just crept on me, shakin' me, baby
Whoa-oh, you done messed up my happy home

You know, ya move me, baby
Just like a hurricaine
(Boy, an that's a strong wind)
Whoa, you move me, pretty mama
You know, you move me
Just like a hurricaine
(Didn't have a chance)
Ooh, you move me, pretty mama
Just like a earthquake can move the land

(Boy, she shook me all over)
(harmonica & instrumental)

'Have Mercy On Me! '

Sometimes I wonder-ooo
What's gonna happen
To my po' wife and child?
Lord, sometimes I wonder-ooo
What's gonna happen
To my po' wife and child?
Now baby, you done made me love you-ooo
Lord, I just can't be satisfied

You know ya shook me
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me, mama
(Wouldn't even stop)
You shook me all night long
You know you kept on shakin' me, darlin'
Lord, you done messed up my happy home
