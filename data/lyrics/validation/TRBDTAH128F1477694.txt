You know who I'm thinkin bout right now right?...

I, Girl I feel you, think that you may not be
The kind of a girl, that everybody
Looks for now-a-days, but I... gotta say
That it doesn't, really matter to me....

Chorus:
Cause in you're eyes, I can see the skies and all the heavens
And you're my angel (oh yeah)
And I just wish that the world could witness
All the joy that you make me feel

Bridge: (repeat 2 times)
Cause when I'm with you...
I couldn't even see myself being nothing wit another woman
Cause when I'm with you...
Nothin else matters, and I ain't even thinkin about nobody else

Verse 2:
Don't you ever, ever think that you're not beautiful (no)
Cause I'll always be the one to tell you so
Lookin back, back on love and all the things that I've been through
I feel God's presence when I'm with you (oh oh)

Chorus:

Bridge: (repeat 2 times)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ music breaks down to instrumental ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Nooooooo)

Bridge: (repeat until music fades away)
