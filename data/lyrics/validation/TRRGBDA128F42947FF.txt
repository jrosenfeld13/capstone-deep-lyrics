Oh c'mon luv me
You can feel the fire
I'm drownin' in my lonely tears
How many hearts are lost in my desire
See all my love and fears
If that's the way babe
You want my sweet devotion
I'll be there if you want me
Come see my heart
Is burnin' in emotion
I'm not your souvenir

Madonna Blue
Come kiss me kiss me baby
Madonna Blue
Come touch me touch me now
I'm gonna make you feel like a lady
I know heav'n must have sent you
Madonna Blue
Come love to love me baby
Madonna Blue
Oh feel my heart tonight
My first hello oh I want you my lady
Is your love too good to be true

Come live for love babe
But diamonds are forever
Oh nights began to drive me down
T'day we could've
Been so good near together
Love makes the world go round
Don't talk to strangers
Only to surrender
Oh baby I'm too young to die
Oh hear my heart
C'mon love me tender
Come with me where clouds fly
