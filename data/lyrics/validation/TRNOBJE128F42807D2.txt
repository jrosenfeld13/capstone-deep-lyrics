Yeah, I want to tell you baby
Kinda how I feel
Yeah, I'm up when I'm down
My head is so turned around
I know that it's real
When I'm on my knees
I said oh, help me please
Got that love disease
Got that love disease
Aah, such a good feelin'
I'm here with tears on my cheeks
I'm so glad but I'm mad
Most folks cry when they're sad
I'm so strong, yet so weak
I got that fever
Ohhh, I'm so at ease
Oh, won't you help me please
Got that love disease
Got that love disease
I went to see the witch doctor
To ask him what's wrong with me
Gave me soup for my head
An old ball for my eye
For nerves, there was chicken feather teeth
Yeah, I cried for my mama

Said, "Mama, what's wrong with me?"
She said, "Son, don't you worry now
Been goin' on since beginnin' of time
Want to find that woman
Put her lick on you
Just act natural-like
I believe you know what to do."
Yeah, help me please
Got that love disease
I got that love disease, baby
Yeah, I saw my woman
Down on avenue
Yeah, I knew how to cry
When I saw that in her eye
That woman had the fever, too
Wanted to tell me, 'bout some things I knew
I said, oh, help me please
Got that love disease
Got that love disease
Oh, come on baby
Can't stop it now
I can't stop it now
Got that love
Got that love
Ohwo
