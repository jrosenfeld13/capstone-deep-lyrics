Going' alone, life is your own, but the cost sometimes is dear
Being complete, knowing defeat, keeping on from year to year
It takes some doing, monkery's the blues you hear, keeping on from year to year
Life is a school, less' your a fool, but the learning brings you pain
Knowing at once, you're just a dunce, trail and error loss and gain
It takes some doing, monkery's a slow slow train, trail and error loss and gain
Finding your one Place in the sun, Doesn't come the easy way
Shallow or deep, Nothing is cheap, Measured by the dues you pay
It takes some doing, Monkery's a blue highway, Measured by the dues you pay
