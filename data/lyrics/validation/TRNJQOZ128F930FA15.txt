Hook:
Blood pours out my vains
And i will not break down and cry again
My love for you was strong tonight
And thats why you had to die, my friend

Verse 1:
One step left - two steps right
Thats where we were, when we began to fight
One step back - three steps left
Thats where i ripped the shirt off your chest
And you screamed - and i smiled
When you had your face, pushed against those tiles
And my hand - over your mouth
Preventing you to scream and shout
Just you and me - all alone
No one to save you, nowhere to go
One two three - four five six
Spin around and embrace my dick
And i impale - your fucking cunt
Please dont faint, ive just begun
To fuck you hard - take you from behind
Bash your and smash your face, everytime you cry

Bridge:
(Please now please, dont cry my love)
(Now please now please, you'll die my love)
(Please now please, dont cry my love)
(Shut the fuck up or you'll drown in blood)

Verse 2:
It doesnt matter - how long you scream
No mather how hard you wish, you know it's not a dream
This pain is real - and so am i
Youve seen my face so now you have to die
So i grab your hair - and bash you to the ground
The brain shows between, the cracking sound
Of your skull - smashing down
One two three, then turn around
Laying on the ground - twitch and twirl
Not talking anymore, now thats a nice girl
Carve in my arm - one two slice
A scar for everytime another girl dies
Clean up the mess - dump the corpse
Let the stupid cops, take you to the morgue
Now im done - with this shit
I'll continue my dance with another bitch
