A wall of denial is falling down
Whoa it's fallin' so hard, down to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
But this wall of denial was just built on fear

We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
Dressed them, amused them, pulling' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go
All the while they were killin' us, but we couldn't let it show

No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
We're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumbling down
Down to the ground

Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure
A smile, a kiss, a little baby's laughter
It makes no difference if we run away in fear
The little things in life hold us so near

No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
Never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial must tumble down
Down to the ground
