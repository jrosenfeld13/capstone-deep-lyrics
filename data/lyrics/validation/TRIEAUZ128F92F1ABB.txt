Cut me out of this role
I can't play it anymore
It must be something in the water here

Give me up
I confess
I feel as though I'm living less
The strangest gravity affects my way
Because I was born incomplete
Drowning in the brevity
Kind of like a road you're traveling on

Chorus:
Everything in 2's
You often lose
You make me whole again
Everything in 2's
You never knew
You'd make me whole again

Someone said, someone wrote
We're floating tethered to a rope
So complicate me
I could use the weight
In how you move the scenery
Lover, how you mirror me
But stop me if you've heard it all before

Chorus

And now and again
You find yourself over your head
In a cynical time, in you I find
A reason to live

Chorus

Cut me out of this role
I can't play it anymore
It must be something in the water here
