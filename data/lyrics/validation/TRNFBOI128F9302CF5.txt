When the old man
Was talking to the young man
You know the young man
He didn't give a damn

When the young man
Was talking to the old man
You know the old man
He wouldn't understand

Though each appear to be sure he was right
The seeds of doubt have been planted inside
So they argued on into the night
Too proud and stubborn to see eye to eye

There were two men
Talking when the day came
When the day came
Neither remained again

Both agreed that the motives were right
They couldn't see other's methods applied
So they argued on into the night
Too proud and stubborn to see eye to eye

When the old man
Was talking to the young man
You know the young man
He didn't give a damn

When the young man
Was talking to the old man
You know the old man
He wouldn't understand

Though each appear to be sure he was right
The seeds of doubt have been planted inside
So they argued on into the night
Too proud and stubborn to see eye to eye
