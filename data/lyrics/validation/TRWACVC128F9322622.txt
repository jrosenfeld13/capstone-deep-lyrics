On the day you left I didn't know
Which way to turn -- which way to go
I felt so bad -- I cursed the day that I was born

And even now I just can't stand
To think of you with another man
But does he know, does he really know
What he's taken on?

I searched my soul, I wracked my brain
At times I thought I'd go insane
And every night I lay awake until the dawn

Yes I was lost, I was confused
But he's the one who's being used
Yeah does he know, does he really know
What he's taken on?

Now he might think he's got your love
And that it came from God above
Threw you a line -- he sowed the seeds
He sees your beauty but I know your needs

He believes that you're sincere
When you say love ain't living here
Yeah does he know -- does he really know
What he's taken on?

Now he might think he's got your love
And that it came from God above
Is he so blind that he can't see
You'll leave him like you left me

You sailed away all by yourself
And I was left here on the shelf
I never thought I'd say these words
But I'm glad you're gone

Yeah he's found truth -- certainty
Resolution, veracity
But does he know -- does he really know
What he's taken on?

Well does he know? Well does he know?
Well does he know? Well does he know?
No no no no no!
