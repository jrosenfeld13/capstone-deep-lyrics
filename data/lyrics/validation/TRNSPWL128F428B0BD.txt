An ideological system, constructed to guarantee
That the public remains passive, uneducated, in apathy
That the crimes committed, they just pass us by
As the state continues to fill us with lies
Face the flag, in the land of hypocrisy
Free to conquer, free to rape, free to kill, free to take
Free to do whatever's in your will
How many actions, in the name of democracy?
When we don't even know, who's our enemy
Survival of the filtest, blend with superiority
So many untold stories, can't spell credibility
How many lies in the name of:
Freedom, Peace, Progress, Democracy?
Tolerance is acceptance
The 5th freedom
