[Chorus]
She was a small town girl
In the big city (she was a small town girl)
I lost my love
In the big city

[Verse 1]
And the big town (big town)
Is a cruel town (cruel town)
Something starts happening
When the sun goes down
And if you don't watch out
For all those hip cats (oooh)
And they will try to talk your babe
Into a Cadillac

[Chorus]
And that's how I lost my love
I do believe
In the big city
I know, that I did
And I'm tellin' you
I lost my love (my love)
In the big city

[Verse 2]
Always some place to go (place to go)
If you are in the know (in the know)
And you can go high class
Or you can swing 'em low
And everywhere we went
She heard a different line
And truly changed the heart
Of that little girl of mine

[Chorus]
And that's how I lost my love
I know
In the big city
Yes I did, yes I did
I'm tellin' you
I lost my love (my love)
In the big city

[Verse 3]
She was still [?] sweet
She swept me off my feet
But, she was just a small town girl
Her kisses were divine
She said that she'd be mine
The city was a strange new world
At them Hollywoods
Where movie makers are
And they can tell you babe
"I'll make you a star"
And if this kind of jive
Goes to her head (oooh)
You can kiss tomorrow goodbye
Young romance is dead

[Chorus]
I lost my love, I know
In the big city
I wanna tell you people
That I lost my love (my love)
In the big city

[Outro]
In the big city
In the big city
Lost my love
I lost my love
