Thought I was gone
I came back
I want you to know
I'm as serious as a heart attack
Let me love you
Let me try
I want to stay today
I wanted to share your life
I'm serious
Serious
Serious
Serious as a heart attack, hey-hey
I'm serious
Serious
Serious, serious

One cup of coffee
Two cups of tea
One for you
I need, two for me
I see you like to, wine and dine
Yes I do babe
You get the glass
And I'll buy the wine
I'm serious
Serious
Serious
Serious as a heart attack, hey-hey
I'm serious
Serious
Serious, serious

SOLO

Serious about the music, that I play
Serious about the way, you look everyday
Serious about the way you wear your hair
I know you like my hair, yeah
Serious about been at home, when you ain't there
I'm serious
Serious
I'm serious
Serious as a heart attack, hey-hey
Serious
Serious
Serious, serious

Serious
