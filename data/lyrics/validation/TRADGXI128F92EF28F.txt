Get me out of here
This isnt slowing down
Weve hit black ice and lost control
Were spinning faster now
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesnt come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you dont give a damn
About the days when you would live the words you wrote
Not the person who you were; I hate the person youve become
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from
A person I will not become
A jaded liar, unforgivable

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable

You said you started up this home
Because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Dont ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from
A person I will not become
A jaded liar, unforgivable

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable

This is The Fallen

This is the last time you will have us
You're lawless and purely dishonest
A scandal that we have funded for you
Make no mistake this all is about you

No, we never knew
(This is the last time you will have us.)
Don't buy what they sell you
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from
I will never lose my youth
All of this is too unforgettable

Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling love
Some stop feeling...

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from
A person I will not become
A jaded liar, unforgivable

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable
