I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silv'ry sea

I long to hold you near
Baby kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore

Now I know the lonely nights
While all the while my heart is whisp'ring
Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me
