It's not a matter of being bored
But the things that we've ignored
Are coming back to haunt us once again
I close my eyes, the lights are dim
But I see you stagger in
With crumpled photographs of where you've been

I'm feeling guilty I confess
It's hard to see you such a mess
I know no matter what I say
You'll just lose it and turn away

If you're going to walk then walk away, walk away
We'll have time to talk about it some day
Fortunes change, your luck is strong
Hope your journey lasts that long
If you're going to stay then stay for real
Pick up the pieces of the way you feel
Sometimes you can fly around, but everyone hits the ground
Call me up sometime when you come down

Walking the streets that we have named
Arm around you, not ashamed
To be the last ones that we'll ever see
I followed the look that was in your eyes
What's the point in apologizing
We were left alone and seventeen

I've seen it a million times and yet
I never remember the way you get
You walk in just like it's victory days
And wind up screaming in a drunken haze

If you're going to walk then walk away, walk away
We'll have time to talk about it some day
Fortunes change, your luck is strong
Hope your journey lasts that long
If you're going to stay then stay for real
Pick up the pieces of the way you feel
Sometimes you can fly around, but everyone hits the ground
Call me up sometime when you come down

Alright I guess we've closed that door
I still don't know what you're waiting for

So much to lose not much to gain
But you don't see it you're an angel flying high above us all tonight

There's not an answer that I have found
I just want to know you'll be around
I know no matter what I say
You'll just lose it and walk away

If you're going to walk then walk away, walk away
We'll have time to talk about it some day
Fortunes change, your luck is strong
Hope your journey lasts that long
If you're going to love then love for real
Pick up the pieces of the way you feel
Sometimes you can fly around, but everyone hits the ground
Call me up some day when you come down
