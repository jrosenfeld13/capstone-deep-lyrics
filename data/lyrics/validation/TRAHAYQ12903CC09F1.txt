I rise from my trench
Blood rushing in my head
Out into no-man's land
Out to join the dead

Sick of living, unwilling to die
Killing just to stay alive

On frozen fields of horror
March through the firestorm
Mangeled victims lay
Forgotten and forlorn

To voiceless cries only
The deaf ad here
Blinded I rage uncontrolled

Fool killing fool
Conflict makes us tick
Pig killing pig
The human race is sick

Pain twist my body
As my enemy splits my face
Another fucking victim
Left to die in a bloody haze
