Escape- only in my mind
Hate- within these walls I find
Break- the cycle of viciousness
But not in here
Take- nothing from me, Don't
Make- a bad man out of me
Hate- within these walls I find
And I'm right here

There is no place for the weak here
This is the home of the wicked men
Even if I'm just passing through
At any time in my life could end
I will die fighting if I have to
I will bring one of you with me
I'm only here for moment in time
It could become an eternity

I'll take with me what I see behind these walls
So that I'll never forget when I start to slip or fall
Wait; remember those behind the walls who live in regret
And some won't make it out at all

Don't forget I am all alone in here
That is how I'll do my time
These are the days of reckoning
I'm lucky to be just a passerby
I will stay longer if I have to
I will retain my dignity
I am only here for a moment in time
It feels like an eternity
I'll take with me what I see behind these walls
So that I'll never forget when I start to slip or fall
Wait; remember those behind the walls who live in regret
And some won't make it out at all
