I know I told you no before
I wouldn't let you past my door
Cause there was someone else inside

Well I guess he found somebody new
And nothing I can say or do
Will put her out of his mind

CHORUS:
And he,he was just leaving
Your just in time this time
And i sure could use a friend
I,I've got this feeling
He was just leaving
So come on in

Funny,you should come around tonight
Just when things aren't going right
Just when the door is open wide

CHORUS
