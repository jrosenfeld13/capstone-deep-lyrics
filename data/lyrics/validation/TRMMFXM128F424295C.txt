I could talk to you for days
You make me laugh one thousand ways
And I realise - you fill me up
Like hot water - in my tea cup
I'm enchanted by your smile
I must admit it took a while
For me to see that - this was something
More than - he's my friend, it's nothing

I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real

There's something about you and you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good

Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good

You got me good

There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good

Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good

Your style, your voice, your points of view
The good, the bad and ugly too
Boy I'll take it - give it to me
I'll be careful - give it to me
Addiction don't come close to this
Official is what this shit is
Still I can't say it
No, I can't say that I'm in love

I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real

There's something about you and you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good

Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good

You got me good

There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good

Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
