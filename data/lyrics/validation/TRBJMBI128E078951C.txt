Down through the ages peace
Prevails the countryside
Magistrate makes order and every
Clan maintains their tribe
Law is to the letter and kinsmen
Cling to their pride
Until the son of the baron raped
And stole my daughters life

[Chorus]
It's a Blood Feud
Vengeance is pursued
Winds of war intrude
With a Blood Feud

The baron set to appease me
Just an attempt to stall
His only son's salvation but
No man is above the law
The warriors stood in waiting
All along the fortress wall
The blood began flowing as
One by one they fall

[Chorus]
Hate is awakened, truce is forsaken
An eye for an eye
Every man, woman, child alive
Everyone is gonna die

The clouds of smoke are clearing
To show the final dread
The village lays in plunder and
The land is bathed in red
Revenging life and honor by
The blood that has been shed
The baron's son in shackles and
I'm gonna take his head

[Chorus]
It's a Blood Feud
