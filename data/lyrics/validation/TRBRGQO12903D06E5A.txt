So, meanwhile back at the ranch
My boy, you grovel for an olive branch
Your arms outstretched, fabrication spoken
You severed all ties and the bond was broken

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
And it makes me sick
You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
In a bit

Meanwhile back at the bar
Big time Charlie gone to far
Bore him with your stories
From all that you know
You know everything from Wikipedia and it shows

Because he's full of shit and so are you
You're a weasel and I've had a bird's eye view

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
It makes me sick

So everyone is at your place
Cameras out for Facebook
Shoe in the face, not one is a friend
There is a reason for this
The pragmatics of which you've seem to have missed

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
And it makes me sick
You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy

And it makes me sick
And it makes me sick
And it makes me sick
And it makes me sick
