I'm wearing my hands to the bone
I can't stop thinking and it's just because I'm human
Taking no comfort that I know
An unknown number in this countless swarming million
I keep dreaming of the places where I used to spend my days
And they're the places where the children run and play
Take me to that place
I think I've nearly had my time
Take me to that place
I wait to dance with the lord of the flies
