Could it be I'm stuck in a world of repetition?
With people pretending they're so in love
Could it be I found a way out of this one?
'Cause all I ever do is sleep
Come take me now

Ah you make me want to
Use my imagination

Could it be I'm here but I was never breathing?
I was running circles around my head
Could it be my lungs won't take what they're given?
'Cause all I ever do is sleep
Come take me now

Ah you make me want to
Use my imagination

All I want to do is believe I've got you
Even if it's never to be enough to
All I want to do is believe I've got you now
'Cause all I ever do is sleep here
And use my imagination
We can imagine!
