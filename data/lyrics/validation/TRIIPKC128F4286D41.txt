[Verse 1]
I got on the phone and called the girls
Said, "Meet me down at Curly Pearls
For a 'Ney nah neh nah'"
(Ney nah neh nah)
In my high-heeled shoes and fancy fads
I ran down the stairs, hailed me a cab
Going, "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)

[Chorus]
Ney nah neh nah
(Ney nah neh nah)
Oh, nah ney nah neh nah
(Ney nah neh nah)
Nah neh nah

[Verse 2]
When I pushed the door, I saw Eleanor
And Mary Lou swinging on the floor
Going, "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)
Sue came in in a silk sarong
She waltzed across as they played that song
I mean, "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Annie was a little late
She had to get out of a date
With a "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)
Curly fixed another drink
As the piano man began to sing
That song "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It was already half past three
But the night was young, and so were we
Dancing "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)
Oh Lord, did we have a ball!
Still singing walking down that hall
That "Ney nah neh nah"
(Ney nah neh nah)

[Chorus]
