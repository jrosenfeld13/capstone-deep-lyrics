If you see me and I look away
Please don't ask me
There's nothing to say about the way that I feel
It's hard to conceal when it's in my eyes
If I tell you that I'm doin' fine
Please believe me
It may be a lie but I've got to move on
I've got to be strong
Now what else can I do?

Cause I've been
Wanting waiting hoping praying
Oh I feel like I'm suffocating
There's nothing left to lose

If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I'm over pretending
That I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love
But I guess that nobody's immune

There's a poison
That runs through my veins when I'm sleeping
And just like a secret
That I try to keep
I buried too deep
Like the memories of you

But I'm still here
Wanting waiting hoping praying
Oh I feel like I'm suffocating
There's nothing left to lose

If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I'm over pretending
That I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love
But I guess that nobody's immune

If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I'm over pretending
That I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love
But I guess that nobody's
If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I'm over pretending
That I can survive without you (I can survive without you)
Thought I was stronger than love
But I guess that nobody's immune
