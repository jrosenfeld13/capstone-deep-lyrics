[Verse 1]
Eve, you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hanging in the tree?
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why, I can't even count the good friends I've already lost

[Chorus 1]
'Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues

[Verse 2]
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say "I feel your pain"

[Chorus 2]
PMS blues, PMS blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying, PMS blues

[Bridge]
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?

[Verse 3]
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvinist or just fall victim to

[Chorus 3]
Those PMS blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS blues
You don't want to cross my path 'cause a pit bull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenching, fluid retention
Head a swelling, can't stop yelling
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
PMS blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swinging, tears a slinging
Nothing fits me when it hits me
Rantin', raving, misbehaving, PMS blues

[Verse 4]
It's the only time in my life I ever think about wishing I'd been a man
But you know that only means one thing
If I'd have been a man, I'd be somewhere right this very minute
With some old cranky, nagging, ragging hateful woman

[Chorus 4]
With those old PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't want to talk about it, we both could do without it
Got those treat your kids bad, don't you talk back
Gone ballistic, unrealistic
Awful lowdown, bitch to be around, PMS blues
