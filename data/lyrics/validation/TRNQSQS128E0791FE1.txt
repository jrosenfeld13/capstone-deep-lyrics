It's twenty one hours - I have been up today
I'm doing handstands - yeah, I feel OK
I got a new way of living - it ain't no phase
It's a new begining - yeah I changed my way
I walk down the street got the sun in my hair
Got my route laid out and my mind is clear
Got my pen and my pad, gonna get it all down
'Cos words are a raod that lead outta town

But I got twenty five tickets and a week to pay
It don't worry me none, cos it's a week today
I see mighty colours in all of my dream
I see rainbows in puddles as I walk down the street
Ain't got now worries, got the beat in my shoes
I'm picking up waves, yeah, I'm making the moves
And I won't get had, I won't get fooled
I won't get had, I won't get fooled!
'Cos I got the one thing I learned at school

Ain't no rules
Ain't no rules
Ain't no rules
Ain't no rules

I been out on the road, busting my butt
But I love what I do, I love it so much
'Cos it keeps me cool, it keeps me small
I walk down the street with the sun in my hair
Got my route laid out and my mind is clear

Got my route laid out and my mind is clear
Got my route laid out and my mind is clear
Got my route laid out and my mind is clear
Got my route laid out and my mind is clear

And I won't get had, I won't get fooled
'Cos I got the one thing I learned at school

Ain't no rules
Ain't no rules
Ain't no rules
