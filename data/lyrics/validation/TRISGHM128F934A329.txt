Puts a hard line darling
What's all the news I'm hearing
Is it so that you've been nearer
Since I've gone
Since I've gone away
You know I live for you

I would feel much better
If I knew you got this letter
Cause the road that lays between us
Is one week long
And I don't have the will
To come and see you now

Say you never said you loved him
Say your thoughts are miles above him
Say you never said you loved him
Say it again
Say it a million times
Say it once for me

Cause I feel alright
I feel alright

I would feel much better
If I knew you got this letter
Cause the road that lays between us
Is one week long
And I don't have the bread
To come and see you now
And I don't have the bread
To come and see you now
