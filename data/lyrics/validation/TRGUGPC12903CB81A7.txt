It seems I'm always lookin' for something I can't find

Love that's true and lasting to ease my troubled mind

Just when I think I found it and new light starts to dawn

Darkness closes in and love is gone

Chorus:
Here to stay then blown away and gone like the smoke

From a fast mail train rollin' down the track

Whistle blows off she goes

Gone and she's never comin' back

Gone, gone, gone

I told her that I loved her She said she loved me too

Neither one was lyin' and yet it wasn't true

We kept on hopin' love would find a way to carry on

Then we woke up one mornin' love was gone

Chorus

Why does this keep happenin, is this the path I chose

Is there something deep inside that makes me bound to lose

That makes me turn this love away when closest I am drawn

The moment that it's finally here it's gone

Here to stay then blown away and gone

Chorus
