Listen up here said a wise man to a fool
Here unlike there there are no set rules
Remember one thing you came here alone
Thats how youll do this bid, thats how youll go home
Learn how to do time, dont let time do you
Now that youve entered your humanity is withdrawn
Known only as a din number, your life is at pawn
I bet you never imagined to be beaten
And caged with no one to pity your prayers nor your pains
And you thought in the streets that your life was so unfair and cruel
Make one careless mistake here boy
And youll drown in your own pool
So take this advice stay alert and on cue
Keep only to yourself and your ears in hsarp tune
