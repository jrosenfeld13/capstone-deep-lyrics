Pick the one you like
Love the one you're with
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

A prize in every pack
Take it from the top
You're going down the wrong road
And it doesn't even matter

Remember you're a girl, remember you're a boy
Cause interesting people always spread the joy
Interesting people, get away with it

It's time to run the race
We're all on the way
Going down the wrong road and it doesn't even matter
Show up on the day
Take it all the way
You're living in the wrong time but it doesn't even matter

Forget that you're a boy, forget that you're a girl
Cause interesting people always rule the world
Interesting people get away with it
All the time

Ooooh, ooooooh
