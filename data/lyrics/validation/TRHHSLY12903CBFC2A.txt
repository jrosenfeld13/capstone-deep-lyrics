How can I give you what I'm asking for
Oh, oh baby, when the feeling's gone?
(When the feeling is gone)
How can I respect the things you say
Oh, oh baby, when the feeling's gone?
(When the feeling is gone)

You promised together we'll always remain
You said my love wouldn't be in vain
Now didn't you, baby?
You changed everything about me but my name
Now didn't you, baby?
There's nothing more to say
Let's go our separate ways. oh baby

How can I take you back into my arms
Oh, oh baby, when the feeling's gone?
(When the feeling is gone)
And how can I forgive what you've done
Oh, oh baby, when the feeling's gone?
(When the feeling is gone)

Where were you when I needed you?
You know what you said and do
You said, "And to each life some tears would fall"
Now didn't you, baby? Hey, hey, hey!
You said your love for me would dry them all away
Now didn't you, baby?
It's all over, dear
I cried my last tears for you

But I want you to know I'm gonna keep on giving my love
But not to you, baby, hey, hey, hey!
I want you to know I'm gonna keep on needing someone
But it won't be you, baby
Oh, oh baby, oh how can I give my love
When the feeling is gone?
How can I love you?
