So it's finally over, huh?
Yeah, look at you
I guess you really miss your baby now that he's gone
And I think you realize you'll never miss your water
Until the well runs dry

Now you're free
To do as you please
Love's in the past
You're a free girl at last
You can do all the things (Do all the things)
He never let you do (He never let you do)

Won't be around to check up on you

But when you're alone
You're gonna find you still care
Call out his name
And you wish he was there
Don't you miss him now?

Go on, live it up (Live it up)
Have yourself a ball (Have yourself a ball)
There's no one there
To cause you trouble at all
You can go out each night (Go out each night)
And hang out till dawn (Hang out till dawn)
He won't be around
To fuss and carry on

But when you're alone

You're gonna find you still care
Call out his name
And you wish he was there
Don't you miss him now? Yeah, yeah

Now you're all alone (I know you miss him)
Mm, mm
You got no one to call your own (I know you miss him), yeah
I know you feel like crying (I know you miss him)
'Cause there's no denying
He's gone (He's gone), yeah, yeah

When you're alone
Oh, you're gonna find you still care, ooh ooh ooh
Call out his name, yeah, yeah, yeah
And you wish he was there
He's you're baby
(Don't you miss him there)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
When you're alone
Baby, you're gonna find you still care
No, no, no, no, oh, oh
Well, well, well
Yeah, he's your baby
