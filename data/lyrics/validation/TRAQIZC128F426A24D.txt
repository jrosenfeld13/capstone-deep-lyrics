Pain, pain inside my brain
I'm going just insane
When I see this times
Now, it's getting dark

Greed, greed is ruling the world
A voice that can't be heard
Wants to save their souls
But no one cares

[Chorus:]
Yes, I don't wanna know
Where the good times gonna go
Yes, I don't wanna know
Where all the tears are gonna flow

The years, the years are blown away
Night instead of day
Nature has to die
It's a silent cry

[Chorus 3x :]
Yes, I don't wanna know
Where the good times gonna go
Yes, I don't wanna know
Where all the tears are gonna flow

Greed, greed is ruling the world
A voice that can't be heard
Wants to save their souls
The years are blown away
But no one cares

But no one cares
