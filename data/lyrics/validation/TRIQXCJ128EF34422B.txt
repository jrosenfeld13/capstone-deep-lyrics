Girl I like what you do to me
Girl I like what you say to me but
Lately now you've been the biggest distraction whoa
Just trying to get all of my attention on you
But you're never, never satisfied
Never good enough, it's never good enough
Never good enough, it's never good enough for you
Girl I tell you that I love you
Girl it's such an easy thing to do but I
I can't stay all around talking forever, oh
You always think somethings wrong when we're not together, you hung up the phone
Think I'll finish what I need to say
It's never good enough, it's never good enough
It's never good enough, it's never good enough for you
Maybe I got no one left to
Seems you're never, never satisfied
Never good enough, never good enough
Never good enough, it's never good enough for you
It's never good enough
It's never good enough for you
