Elladonna
Each cry
Passing incandescent creatures
Dark recess

Living is hot
To retort
???
Evaporate
Teaching nothing new
No truth
Conform, conform, conform, con-

Conflate in the forest
Everything that's hot
It's melody
Morality, morality

It's him the beast
Forest creeps
Steep rocks
The paws bleed
Waving her
A cold rabies whir
Seeking a gut clench
Best prolong the dread
The fiends set upon him
To tear to pieces
Him heart to hide

Eyes feeling
Credibly rapidly
Definitive bits
Contemplate edify my grace
Blood beaks
