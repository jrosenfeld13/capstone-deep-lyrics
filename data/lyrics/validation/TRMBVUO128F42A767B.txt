You told me
That you would leave me here in tears
But now you're gone
And hours seem like years
So, darling, I sing my song

You're leaving
Makes my heart beat low and slow
Now I'm wondering where did you go?
Please tell me what is wrong

I still love you
Won't you please come back to me?
Come back where you oughtta be
Don't stay from me
'Cause you'll always be my own
We'll be together for eternity

You told me
That you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone
And hours seem like years
So, darling, I sing my song

I still love you
Won't you please come back to me
Come back where you oughtta be
Don't stay from me
'Cause you'll always be my own
We'll be together for eternity

You told me
That you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone
And hours seem like years
So, darling, I sing my song
