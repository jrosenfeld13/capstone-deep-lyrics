[Verse 1]
You are young, and so am I
And this is wrong, but who am I to judge?
You feel like heaven when we touch
I guess for me, this is enough

[Chorus]
We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

[Verse 2]
You are young and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years, but I don't care
And I can feel your heartbeat
You know exactly where to take me

[Chorus]
We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

[Bridge]
"Will you remember me?"
You ask me as I leave
Remember what I said?
"Oh, how could I? Oh, how could I forget?"

[Chorus 3x]
We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight
