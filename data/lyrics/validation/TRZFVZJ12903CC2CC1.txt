When the bells all ring, and the horns all blow
And the couples we know are fondly kissing
Will I be with you
Or will I be among the missing?
Maybe its still too early in the game
Still i thought Id ask you just the same
What are you doing new years
New years eve?
Wonder whos arms will hold you oh so tight
When its exactly 12:00 that night
Welcoming in the new year
New years eve
Maybe Im crazy
Crazy to suppose
Id ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations youll receive
Oh, but in case i stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing new years
New years eve
