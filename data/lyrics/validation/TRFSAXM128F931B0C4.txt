[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he live or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 2]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]
