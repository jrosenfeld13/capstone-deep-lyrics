In his home, a dark cavern
Lay Smash the Dregon, he is so sad
His whole life, no adventure
Lazily lolling in gold of bad
Then he hears, little creature
Creeping slowly towards his hide
Oh, don't worry, Smash the Dragon
Swallow the beast when he's in sight
Flix he loves deceit
With only the black stone in eye
Worth more than the eyes can meet
The ring he'll now apply
Smash he know, someone's near
Smash he is spying but he can't see
Where are you? What is your will?
When my breath lights you belong to me
Flix he loves deceit
The stone has flashed in his eye
Like a breath we can not see
Like the ring he did apply
Hear, I'll show you this
The ring and his might surely will use you
Hear, I'll show you this
The ring and his might slowly destroys you
Flix calls: Hey! Over here!
The echo it fools Smash's ear
The dragon he thinks he is near
Flix got the stone
Running fast away
I've got the stone! He did chant
Smash sent his fiery flame
Burned the thief's seat of his pants
