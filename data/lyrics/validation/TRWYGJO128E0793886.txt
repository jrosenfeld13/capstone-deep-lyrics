Written by B. Setzer

There's a place where you can go
Music's hot and lights are low
But there's something you should know
Before the night is through

'Neath a buzzing neon sign
Dressed in style so cool and refined
Stands a man from another time
Who's calling out to you

There in the night that has heard a thousand voices
Whispered a thousand names
Sang out a thousand love songs
He lives his Hollywood nocturne

There's a place he'd like to go
Where it's cool and lights are low
But the shadows won't let go
They dance and call his name

As he roams the streets at night
Haunted by this devil sight
There's a man in dark red light
Who's calling out to you

There in the night that has heard a thousand voices
Whispered a thousand names
Sang out a thousand love songs
He lives his Hollywood nocturne

His Hollywood nocturne
His Hollywood nocturne
