You can't all pretend
That you don't know enough
Enough to make sense
All this will be gone
And you can sink beneath
The rapture we've spawned

What have we become

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this

The Blind will bleed the blind
When the only thing to see is their lies
Let not the sun go down
On the wrath of this inconvenient truth

What have we become

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this

Just smile like the idiots you are, and swim

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this
