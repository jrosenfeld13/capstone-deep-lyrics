Dont you ever be sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you are down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

I'm on my way, your lover
If you get cold, yeah, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry, 'cause I'm here
No need to suffer, baby, cause I'm near

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

Looky here
Reach out to me
For satisfaction, yeah
Looky here, Dave, thats all she got to do
Call my name, yeah, for quick reaction
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
When the day comes and you are down, baby
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
