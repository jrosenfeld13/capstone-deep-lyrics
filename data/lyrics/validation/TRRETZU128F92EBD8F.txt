One night when the stars were right
For the gypsy queen
And she found she could drog you down
To a place that's in between it all
She's a madman with a delicate hand
And evil eyes
And I've heard she'll only say a word
But that's enough to satisfy

Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go

She's not above
Death by love

One spell from the wishing well
And you're nevermore
A bad start for the sacred heart
'Cause the end has come before the beginning
Knee deep in the darkest sleep
But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky
And never feel the fall to come

Strong men die
But what a way to go

She's not above
Death by love

Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go

You've got symptoms of
Death by love
She's not above
Death by love

Don't ask why
Don't even guess about it
All men die
But this is death by love
