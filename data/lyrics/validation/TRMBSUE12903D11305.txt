Crickets back, shotgun in front set
Playing god with what used to be
If not for you I would agree
Mistakes are empty and promises are for free cry

Pick a line I heard um does he maybe want to use 'em all
Break your silence as you hit your wall
I taste your freedom it tastes of shit
A force of nature will repeat itself

Cry...and say goodnight
Say goodnight

C'mon and taste it... taste the light

The gravity of you actions are fillet to see
Your cowardice approach of annihilation day

C'mon taste it... taste the light
