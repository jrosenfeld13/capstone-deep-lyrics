Here she comes, you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize, just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows (she's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book, you're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows (she's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks
'Cause everybody knows (she's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale)
Oh-oh-oh, she's a femme fatale, oh-oh-oh, she's a femme fatale
Oh-oh-oh, she's a femme fatale
