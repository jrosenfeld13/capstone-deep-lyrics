I saw that warning sign
But I paid no mind
I just kept on
Rolling on

I saw that warning sign
But I had no time
I was
Headin' for your arms

I saw that warning sign
But I just went blind
Never read a word
That it said

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, "Danger, heartbreak ahead"

I saw that warning sign
It was in your eyes
It was flashing off and on

I saw that warning sign
But I kissed your lips
I just couldn't do no wrong

I saw that warning sign
And it felt so fine
I fall in love with every word you say

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, "Danger, heartbreak ahead"

I saw that warning sign
But I just went blind
Never read a word
That it said

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, "Danger, heartbreak ahead"

Danger ahead
