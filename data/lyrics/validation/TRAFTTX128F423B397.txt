Don't you worry about their kind
They'll be gone long after time
We'll be here, yes we'll be fine, we'll be fine
All the treasure that they sought
Has led them, bled them, just fear not
All their souls, their souls were bought, ours were not
When they think your scene
All they think, the green
Don't you know just what I mean, just what I mean
All the treasure that they sought
Has led them, bled them, just fear not
All their souls, their souls were bought, ours were not
Revelation machine --- move
Revelation machine --- get up and move

We are bringing what is raw
We are bringing tooth and claw
Oh your show, yes that I saw, yes that I saw
But after two times it got old
Yes the story it got cold
After two times it got old, bought and sold
Join me now in saying fuck
Join me now in saying you
Join me know in saying fuck you, fuck you
All the treasure that they sought
Has led them, bled them, just fear not
All their souls, their souls were bought, ours were not

Revelation machine --- move
Revelation machine --- get up and move
Revelation, revelation, revelation, revelation
Come, here, with, me, now, it's, the trip, it's so good
Come here with me now
Come here with me now

Revelation, revelation, revelation
Revelation machine --- move
Revelation machine --- get up and move
Revelation, revelation, revelation, revelation
