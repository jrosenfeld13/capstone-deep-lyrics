I know that you've heard it all before. (Or have you?)
Statistics go in one ear, out the other
And you may say that this is all a bore
And tuck your head back underneath the covers
It's a slaughter of the innocents. It's wasteful, hateful, inefficient
The carcass that you call a feast is a parasite for man and beast
You say that chickens don't deserve to live
'cause after all they eat each other's feces
But could it be that we don't understand
'cause humans are a different fucking species?
I've listened to your obstinate defense
It seems to me your mind's a little lazy
You stubbornly hold on to your excuse
That eating meat is worth it 'cause it's tasty
Now please don't think that I expect that everybody must be perfect
I'm just hoping that these words I say will teach someone something someday
