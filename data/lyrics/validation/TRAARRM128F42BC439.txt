[Verse 1]
In and out of honky tonks from one town to the next
But anything worth loving, Lord, just too hard to forget
Everyday's another way of feeling more the same
Looks like I'll run out of highway before I out run the rain

[Chorus]
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

[Verse 2]
So I'm reaching out to someone wishing, she was you instead
And everything I left behind was waiting up ahead
Pulling on the bottom baby, looking back on you
'Cause anyways the right way babe as long as I pull through

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, when the flame burned out
You left a cold dark cloud a raining down, a raining down on me
Down on me
Raining down on me
Raining down on me
