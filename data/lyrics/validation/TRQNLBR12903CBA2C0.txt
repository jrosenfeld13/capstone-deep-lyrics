Over you I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G"
Tell me how I can't miss this R&B

Me and Jay-z were coolin at the ?
Seen a all-world cover girl
I said hey lady Im sorry if youre in a rush
Dont let me hold you up or intervene or interrupt, but
You got the look - I wanna get to know you better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didnt sweat her
Cause if you would've seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogony - twins name was Ebony
I said my name was Rob, and this is Jay-Z

Baby, aw yeah
I want you to be my, aw yeah

[Repeat: x2]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G"
Tell me how I can't miss this R&B

It's funny how times flies when your havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow
But you know how far a kiss go
Fuck around & miss the show
So I told her hold that thought real tight
We'll finish where we left off later on tonight
In a rise, I knew that she wanted my agony, agony, agony in her body

Baby, oh yeah
I want you to be my, I want you to be my

[Repeat: x2]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy

Drove to some sights, then I took her to the condo
She was pipin hot but don't know me so well
She asked me how come I don't smile
I said everything's fine
But I'm in a new york state of mind, baby
Yeah, I said everything's fine but I'm in a new york state of mind baby

Oh yeah

Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G"
Tell me how I can't miss this R&B

As we reach the kingdom she said
"Bring some champagne, I'll entertain, then sing some
Sentimental song, real gentle"
It hit the spot then you know where we went to
As we embraced & felt our heart pumpin'
She was in the mood for somethin'
So I layed back on my back & relaxed
It wasnt the Perignon that made me collaspe

[Repeat: x2]
Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
