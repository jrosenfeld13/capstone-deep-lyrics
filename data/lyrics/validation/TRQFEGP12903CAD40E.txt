I remember the look on your face
And all the memories of you
A loving girl with no fear in her eyes
A riotous decision to choose

A careless man with no reason inside
He took the life out of you
A bitter end to a brief stay in life
I wish there was some way to choose

Why can't we choose?

We aren't here to stay
We're all the say way
See us fall away
I'll see you in the next life

25 with no reason to die
I know you should be right here
He paid the fine but never did any time
Why is this life so unfair?

We aren't here to stay
We're all the say way
See us fall away
I'll see you in the next life
