This is the middle of the road

Well since our separation you have taken up with thieves
They tell you just how wonderful you are
Baby I have nothing but respect for you
I would never try to rip you off
Cause I know your heart still runs with mine
Youre just afraid of getting soft

Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
Well, its summer time in California
I never felt so cold
Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But I still love you baby
Why dont you come on home?

Well, I put the bat out of my mind and my
Memories are good
The hardwood floor neath your kitchen door
Where you taught me all your dirty words
When we first made love under your ivory cross
It was a rainy Easter Sunday
And we were drinking champagne in the Mulholland hills
When I finally felt that stone roll away

Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But you still got a hold on me
Even though youre getting old
Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But I still love you baby
Why dont you come on home?
Why dont you come on

Well happy birthday baby
Hope youre getting realistic
Youre two months and two years away from the same old sad statistic
To live out in the wilderness
You gotta learn to start a fire
But you can stand out there with your fist in the air
While the rest of us get on with our lives

Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But dont you listen to me baby
Ive been bought and sold
Its a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But I still love you baby
Why dont you come on home?
Why dont you come on
