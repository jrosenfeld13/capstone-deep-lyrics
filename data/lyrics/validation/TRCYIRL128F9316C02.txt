Pearl, listen to me now
I'm about to bring it down
Here are things I need to tell you
That can't wait
I've been doubting in my sleep
There are secrets I keep
Maybe in the end I'll find a way to stay
Pearl, it don't feel that way today

It wasn't long ago, I was down upon my knees
Begging you to change your mind again
You were tired of trying to love me
You had put yourself above me
Tried to leave but, Pearl, I don't let go
That is until tonight, now I know

There's a world outside our window
There's the mystery of desire
I could wait to make you happen
I could set this house on fire

Listen, now
I'm about to bring it down
Are we meant to be, I'll ask again
As I wait for your reply
Hear the traffic passing by
Tomorrow I'll be far away from here
Pearl, I'll be far away from here

Through the world outside my window
Though you're all that I desire
I couldn't make you happen
So I set this house on fire
