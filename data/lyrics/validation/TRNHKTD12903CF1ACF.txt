Went inside the caves of seven wolves
Felt of the forces that lend themselves to speed
Those final words to fracture the very structure
Can't stand this glacial pace
The damage done

It seems these days are getting shorter
Derails my train of thought

What said in hand was done
Chased unforgiveness down these corridors
Locked down the basis for the willing form
A trail far from strayed
The damage done

Set aside from eyes of others
Our frail structures can't keep up with the pace

Brought out for all to see
The damage done
Face contradicting needs

We bring our cages home
For none to see
In vain to lessen
Responsibility
The damage done
