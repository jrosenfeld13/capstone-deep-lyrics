Let's, let's, let's, Let's, LEt's, LET'S (gon' boy)

[Chorus 2X]
Let's get a room get high and get naked
L-L-Let's get a room get high and get naked

[Nasty Nardo - Verse One]
Now I'm feelin kinda tipsy off this Cris' that I been gulpin
Plus I'm gettn drunker off this damn Incredible Hulk-in
Ready for some bonin; shawty, what's the biz' baby?
Three in the mornin and the club is closin quick baby
I don't wanna sound shady I just wanna get witchu
And do the butt, naked thang that grown folks do
In a hotel room, on a hotel flo'
In a hotel bed, this a hotel dough
Wit Nasty, Nardo, pretty boy Capone
Mr. Do-it-to-you-hard, Mr. Do-it-to-you-long
Mr. Back-stayin-strong-when-I'm-swimmin-in-you
Mr. Run-and-tell-ya-friends-how-I-give-it-to-you
'Cause they want some to, they want a sample of dat!
Mr. Splack-her-belly-when-I'm-breakin-yo-back
You tappin out on a mat, I got 'em ringin a bell
When I'm {?} river plungin you in the hotel

[Chorus 4X]

[Nasty Nardo - Verse Two]
I'm on that 'Yac baby, 'cause I'm a Mack baby
I ridin chrome and pushin' Cadillacs baby
I keep a stack baby, 'cause I'm a money hog
I other words baby, I'ma ball till I fall
I'm ten toes tall, I posted up bitch (Be-yotch!)
Just let me know a dope boy's what you fuckin wit
Wit a fat dick workin wit a lil' sumthin
Like ya boy Grim said, "Trick I'm tryna bust sumthin!"
I'm tryna buck sumthin, baby beat that pussy to death
Down to the last drop, 'til it ain't nuthin left
To give ya whatcha ain't felt, from that boy at home
Boo I'm crackin headboards while you holla and moan
Nasty Nardo, Mr. Buckwild
Mr. Break-ya-back-when-we-in-the buck style
Mr. Pow-wow, Mr. Bang bang
Mr. Won't-stop-when-you-screamin-my-name

[Chorus 4X]

[Nasty Nardo - Verse Three]
Now baby, what' the SCOOOOOO'? (Now baby, what' the SCOOOOOO'?) [score]
If you goin, let's GOOOOOOOO (If you goin, let's GOOOOOOOO)
I got a sack fulla DROOOOOOOO  (I got a sack fulla DROOOOOOOO)
That we could smoke 'til we CHOOOOOOOKE (That we could smoke 'til we CHOOOOOOOKE)
I'm talkin all night LOOOOOONG (I'm talkin all night LOOOOOONG)
'Til we see the sun a-gaaaain ('Til we see the sun a-gaaaain)
Me, you, and yo FRIEEENDS (Me, you, and yo FRIEEENDS)
Y'all broads know the BIIIIIIZ (Y'all broads know the BIIIIIIZ)
You know the biz when the playa go and buy you a drink
You know the biz when the playa layin back in the seat
You know the biz when I'm touchin you and just won't stop
You know the biz when a playa grabbin you on the crotch
You know the biz when I'm rubbin you, all on yo tits
You know the biz when I'm tounge-kissin you on yo lips
You know the biz when I'm sweatin like it's hotter than hell
You know the biz when I'm pullin up, in a hotel

[Chorus gets mixed up 'til end]
