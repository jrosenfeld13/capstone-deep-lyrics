So we went after the crash
We step out alone
An undivided healing
That swallows us whole

The air cuts like glass
And you taste like winter
And how long will you last, forever...
And congratulations
You've become what you wanted
Stepping out of this car with that look in your eye and knowing that you've never looked so beautiful

Telephone lines away
Death on the end and I'm screaming
226 on the door
Asking to make out while watching the war

So we went after the crash
We step out alone
An undivided healing
That swallows us whole

Nothing's like this exit
Pale white skin on memory

And I've got the proof to frame the way
As we danced, we bled across the floor
And that never-ending supply what we wished for
It took me 14 hours to get this sore and knowing that you've never looked so beautiful

Telephone lines away
Death on the end and I'm screaming
226 on the door
Asking to make out while watching the war

So we went after the crash
We step out alone
An undivided healing
That swallows us whole

Nothing's like this exit
Pale white skin on memory

25 days and I still can't get this right

So we went after the crash
We step out alone
An undivided healing
That swallows us whole

Nothing's like this exit
Pale white skin on memory

Telephone lines away, felt through a phone line
