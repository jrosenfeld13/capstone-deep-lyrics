Maybe you'll jump into
My ship and blast away
Over the blueish sky
Into out starry night
We'll travel to the moon
Over the Milky Way
Straight for orion's belt
And into Saturn's rings
And when I'm gone
We'll wish on the same star
Jump into my spaceship
Into my spaceship
And we'll blast away
Follow my lead Off to a new scene
Jump into my spaceship
Into my spaceship
And we'll blast away
Come on let's run away
And find a distant land
With no gravity
Let's bounce right up and down
We'll do it on a Wednesday
Maybe a Friday, too
We'll stare right at the earth
Never go back again
Take my hand and follow
We'll travle off to distant lands
With distant sands?
