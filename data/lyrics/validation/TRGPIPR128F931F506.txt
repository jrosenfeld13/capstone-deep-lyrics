What will you give ?
What will you give ?
Made it round and circled it
Stamped my form into the ground
Beneath it I lit a fire sinkiller
Where is it ?
It's at your feet
Where will we meet ?
Ohh not in the pit where the fire is lit
Hot foot it
Hot foot it up above...
What will I find there?
What will I find there?
Your naked sprite
Your dried up spit - your eyes gone blind
Your faithfull mind
Beneath god's heel it's one long grind
Beneath god's heel it's one long grind
Up above that's my trick
Hot foot it
Hot foot it
Hot foot it up above, hey sinkiller up above
