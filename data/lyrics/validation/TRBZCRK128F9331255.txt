Keep the weatherman sweet
Then begin sweeping the driveway
News is that the heats
Coming in, Thursday or Friday
Now Im a little slow to see
How weathermans words are gonna satisfy me
Words can change my point of view
Only if they prove to be true

Seven inches of rain
I believe its gonna get wetter
Seven days of the week
Hopes are high its gonna get better
Now, Im not in the hoping game
Thats a kind of a pity and a bit of a shame
But hope can be a two-edged sword
And a luxury that I just cant afford

[Chorus]
Twelve days, snow would spread the cold around
Twelve days heat would melt the snow on the ground
Twelve days sun is what Im looking for now
Twelve days grey whats in store

Keep the weatherman sweet
Then go off, buy an umbrella
Go and wait for the sun
Go and dream beautiful weather
Im much too old for dreams
Now thats a little bit sad
But not as sad as it seems
When dreams have been a thorny crown
Its not so sad when theyre tumblin down

[Chorus]
