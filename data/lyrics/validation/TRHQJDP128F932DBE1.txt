I'm a great example to the dogs
I grease the wheels and move the cogs
And I'm a friend to you, more than you'll need me

I've walked a world, I've took it in
I'm the eclectic bag of sin
And I don't need to pray, I'm built for better days

I'm the one that took the meanness from the mean
The one that made the moment and the one who will believe
And I was there when everybody left your side

I'm a bad example to the cats
They run around with all the rats
And I reject their style, and I resent their smiles

They've got it all but they take more
And every maiden makes a score
And so I chase my tail
Who wins?
Who cares?

I'm the one that took the meanness from the mean
The one that made the moment and the one who will believe
And I was there when everybody left your side

In the end you nearly killed me with a smile
And you would never speak again
And I was out of time
And I was was crying just before you shut the door
'Cause love was all I'd known
