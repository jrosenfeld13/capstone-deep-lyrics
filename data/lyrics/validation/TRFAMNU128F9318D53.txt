Now I ain't marching anymore
Got my head up to the wall
'Cause I can't hear you whine
Fingers and my feet are selling cheap
Just to keep you mine

You're so big, one step ahead
Said less than zero
No one's hero better left for dead
No one to blame but me for this mess
I made is what you said

Shame on me, shame on me
I believed this was so easy
No one sees you're so pleased
To put the blame on me, it's all on me

I can't stay on the tracks
Discipline is what we lack
But you ain't stopping me again
Don't know if you understand
You made me drop, I have to end it
Hollywood, don't know where to go

Little girl abandoned, left me stranded
And now I'm on my own
It feels so fake but looks so real
Feed the devil, make a deal
Brought us in, how does it feel
To know you sold your soul?

Shame on me, shame on me
I believed it was so easy
No one sees you're so pleased
To put the blame on me, it's all on me

Lost my way, I've come unhinged
Low on strength, I'm on the fringe
I'm on the edge and tipping it
You tell me not to meddle
If there is no end to settle it

You're so big, one step ahead
Said you're less than zero
No one's hero, better left for dead
No one to blame but me for this mess
I made is what you said

Shame on me, shame on me
I believed it was so easy
No one sees you're so pleased
To put the blame on me, it's all on me

Take my heart to heaven

You got the Hollywood flow
And now I'm on my own
It feels so fake but looks so real
Feed the devil, make a deal
Brought us in, how does it feel
To know you sold your soul?

Shame on me, shame on me
I believed it was so easy
No one sees you're so pleased
To put the blame on me, it's all on me
