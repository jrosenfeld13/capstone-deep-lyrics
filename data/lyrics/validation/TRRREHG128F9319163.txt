You want to see me hang around, don't bother me
You wanna know if I'll get down, don't bother me
Well can't take your kind of life no more
Oh can't you see?
So understand the simple truth
Don't bother me
You, you love to hear me say I give up you
You wanna hear me say I break with you
You can't believe that I could love you
You wanna know if I could hate you
Got no time for compromise, don't bother me
You're all the same just a bunch of lies
O can't you see?
Well pretty soon there won't be no more of you or me
Understand the simp
Le truth
Don't bother me
You, you love to hear me say I give up you. You wanna hear me say I break with you
You can't believe that I could love you
You wanna know if I could hate you
