The words you said still linger on
It's just like you're still here
I wonder if you hadn't gone
The waters would have cleared

Are you hiding from something
Do you hear me call your name
Ain't it strange how we behave now
After all that we became

Why, why does everybody hurt
Ain't we been here once before
Too often you walk out the door
Why does everybody hurt

We stand alone
Two hearts divide
Some secrets never show
The sadness glows within your eyes
The sorrow in your tone
There's no point in returning
cause the answers stay the same
Still pretending it's not ending
So instead we start to blame

Are you hiding from something
Do you hear me call your name
Ain't it strange how we behave now
After all that we became
