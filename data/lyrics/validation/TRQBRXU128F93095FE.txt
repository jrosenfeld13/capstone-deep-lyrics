[Verse 1]
I see you every day
And I can't seem to think of anything to say
To you baby, how can it be?
That breaks my heart when you're smiling at me

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

[Verse 2]
In you I see something I won't find
Never again, baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment that I laid my eyes my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

[Bridge]
Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're going to make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you
I'll never decieve you, I'll give you every piece of my heart
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me

[Chorus]
Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

[Outro]
You're all I need to survive
And girl you keep me alive
And girl you shine
Like the sun in the sky
