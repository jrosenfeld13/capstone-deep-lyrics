This ain't working out
(This ain't working)
It's not worth the time I spent on it
When I've been next to you
(This ain't working)
It's not the way you want it
And all I wanna do
Is get away and as far away from it

There's no point 'cos I'm not winning
There's no point going back to the beginning
There's no point in hesitating
There's no point to keep on waiting
There's no point in talking it over
There's no point in getting any closer

If it was up to you
(If it was up to)
We'd go around in circles forever
There's nothing left to do
(There's nothing left to)
I go around - around in you
I've tried to see it through
All I've seen is the stormy weather

There's no point in still pretending
There's no point 'cos this is never ending
There's no point in keep on trying
There's no point to carry on lying
There's no point acting like children
There's no point 'cos this time I'm gone
I'm gone

There's no point in talking it over
There's no point in getting any closer

There's no point in still pretending
There's no point 'cos this is never ending
There's no point in keep on trying
There's no point to carry on lying
There's no point in talking it over
There's no point in getting any closer

There's no point 'cos I'm not winning
There's no point going back to the beginning
There's no point in hesitating
There's no point tonight
There's no point at all
