This little lady down in Texas tight tank top and a tan
Rockin' True Religion britches drinking beer in a can
She was too hot to two-step I was too dumb to just leave her alone
But I made up my mind and I felt the fever coming on
Kinda getting hot

My knuckles turned white and my neck turned red
My one good eye rolled straight back in my head
It makes a Texas tornado seem like a cool breeze
I can feel it coming over me, mad cowboy disease

I was online away from scoring a win
But I was two shots shy of three sheets to the wind
I must've drank a hundred dollars sitting there just trying to work up the nerve
Well one more Jager for my jitters and I was stagger-reaching over to her
I really couldn't walk that good

Well exuse me there honay kinda's trippin' all over myself
Oh lordy, oh boy, here we go again

Talking like Mel T-T-Tillis I said w-what's your n-name
She said you ain't no player boy and I ain't no g-game
But you are kinda cute so when you're feeling better give me a call
And with her black eye-liner she wrote her number on my trembling palm

My knees started shaking I was breaking out a sweat
Trying to memorize her number 'cause my hand was getting wet
I was showing the symptoms looking for a remedy
I can feel it coming over me, mad cowboy disease
Aw, I got that mad cowboy disease

Little hoof in the mouth
Makes ya' tongue hang out all the way to the floor
Down on hands & knees beggin' like a hungry dog
What do ya mean get off my knees
I kinda' like it down here anybody got a leash
