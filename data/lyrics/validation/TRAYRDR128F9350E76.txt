[Verse 1]
Yeah, I want a seven figure swagger (seven figure swagger)

Bow down, pay homage
I'm all up in your frillies like fuck your knowledge
Only real teachers teach
I'm Martin Luther King of this feast
I'm like, preach (I have a dream)
The richest man in Babylon
I am neener neener, make it, I make it mean
I get the knowledge, wisdom of us down in a creek
Cash rules everything around me and
Only cos I wanna feed my family and
Guess that makes me a family man
Most I got for (?) and, that's my fam
I got friends in high places, 10 Downing Street
Chilling with my trainers on your seat
Lean back with the slouch
Mud on your sofa, fuck your couch

[Chorus]
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger

Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger

[Verse 2]
Yeah, loads of cheese mate, loads of cheese, double cheese
I'm making it this year, yeah we're massive

Yeah, I'm on a seven fig swag
Smuggle in the jam holding seven big bags
I get the hella sick slags
Even though I'm still wearing benefit rags
Yeah I'm in it for the swag
In it for the yuppies try'na get a quick shag
In it for the fans thinking 'he's a bit mad'
So if you want it from the bag
Darling get your tits out (Go on darling)
Go on, get your bits out
Yeah I said 'go on get your tits out'
Thick prick, Imma hit you with the sick raps
While your girls chewing on my dick like a KitKat
You can guess who's stacking them chips
I'm for the man and not just banging them chicks
Stop blagging it, please settle down, take a rain check
Seven figure then I swagger off with your paycheck

[Chorus]
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger

Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger

[Verse 3]
(Hola, loud ting) How we doing

[Chorus]
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger

Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
Seven, seven, seven figure swagger
I'm gonna have a seven figure swagger
