[Verse 1]
Beauty over wisdom to fit in with their styles
Your Cinderella story's for a price
Vanity's a business built to fleece the unique
Silicon and stars collide; the rest will fall in line

[Chorus]
Just as beautiful as you are
Its so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along

[Verse 2]
Visually you're stimulating to my eyes
Your Cinderella syndrome's full of lies
Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your ego will kill whats left inside

[Extended Chorus]
Just as beautiful as you are
Its so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along
(Beautiful)
Its so pitiful what you are
As beautiful as you are
You should have seen this coming all along

[Bridge]
You're everything that's so typical
Maybe you're alone for a reason
You're the reason

So pitiful what you are
Should have seen this coming all along
(Beautiful)
Just as beautiful as you are
(Pitiful)
It's so pitiful what you are
(Should have seen)
Should have seen this coming all along
