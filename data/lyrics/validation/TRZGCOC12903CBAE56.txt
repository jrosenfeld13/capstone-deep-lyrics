[Verse 1]
Mornings go best with sunrise
The sunrise I used to see
But never see now
If I was waiting, we'd build it all up
We'd look all around 'til we find, we find

[Chorus]
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky
Threatened to fall
Still I don't believe, no I don't believe
We'll be just fine, We'll be just fine

[Verse 2]
The future was born with a sunrise
The sunrise that builds into days and even more years
And as it rolls burning
Burning up trails
We look all around 'til we find, we find

[Chorus]
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky
Threatened to fall
Still I don't believe, I don't believe
We'll be just fine, yea we'll be just fine

[Verse 3]
The sun it rose up from the belly of sea
Found his bedding up in those clouds where it hung for years
Still I don't believe
While colors rained
And poured from the cotton bound pools and the drips
Those drips stained us all, painted us all
Still I don't believe

[Chorus]
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through that crack in the sky
I don't believe, I don't believe

The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky
I don't believe, I don't believe
That we'll be just fine, we'll be just fine
We'll be just fine
I don't believe, no I don't believe
No I don't believe
