Your smile once warm has turned so cold
Feel the fire fading
A house divided sure must fall
So let's unite here one and all

Tell me why we're waiting
Tell me what we're waiting for
Tell me why we're waiting

Alone a broken heart can't mend
Still we search how long it takes
Are we slaves to our own fears?
Break the silence, show your tears
All this fear leads us nowhere
Raise your hands and show you care
Beyond the hatred and the lies
Awaits the love we keep alive

The storm we ride the wind howls cold
Darkness that we sail in
Some distant light brings us to shore
Release these chains forever more

Tell me why we're waiting
Tell me what we're waiting for
Tell me why we're waiting

Alone a broken heart can't mend
Still we search how long it takes
Are we slaves to our own fears?
Break the silence, show your tears
All this fear leads us nowhere
Raise your hands and show you care
Beyond the hatred and the lies
Awaits the love we keep alive

Alone a broken heart can't mend
Are we slaves to our own fears?
All this fear leads us nowhere
Beyond the hatred and the lies
Awaits the love we keep alive

Alone a broken heart can't mend
Still we search how long it takes
Are we slaves to our own fears?
Break the silence, show your tears
All this fear leads us nowhere
Raise your hands and show you care
Beyond the hatred and the lies
Awaits the love we keep alive
