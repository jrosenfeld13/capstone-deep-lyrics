[Intro]
People are people so (people are people so)
You and I should get along (you and I should get along)
People are people so (people are people so)
You and I should get along (you and I should get along)

[Verse 1]
So we're different colors
And we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I never even met you
So what could I have done

[Pre-Chorus: x2]
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

[Chorus: x2]
People are people, so
Why should it be
You and I should get along
So awfully?

Help me understand
Why should it be

[Verse 2]
Now you're punching and you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fist

[Pre-Chorus: x2]
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

Help me understand
Help me understand

[Chorus: x2]
People are people, so
Why should it be
You and I should get along
So awfully?

[Chorus: x2]
People are people, so
Why should it be
You and I should get along
So awfully?

Help me understand, yeah
People are people, so
Why should it be
People are people, so
Why should it be
People are people, so
Why should it be
You and I should get along
You and I should get along

[Repeat]
Should get along-
