Don't you notice something different tonight
Look here, i took off all my clothes
And you may touch me anywhere you like
Oooh, everywhere you like me

If you are somebody different tonight
Than you were only yesterday
Please don't tell me, no, don't explain
I get easily confused these days
Oooh, sometimes i even cry

And now i found, that when i open my eyes
I fall and that's all i ever do
So if you touch me, if you move me now
Oooh, we make love, falling

We make love, falling
We make love, falling
