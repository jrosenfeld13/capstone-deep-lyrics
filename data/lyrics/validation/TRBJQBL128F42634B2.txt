Just straight up the plane from L.A
Just take a look at me
A real good lookin'
I'm all designed up
I've got my lipstick on
My bucci bag
And my proud ski dress
And I am ready to rock

Straight up the plane from L.A

I've got my proud ski dress
I've got my proud ski dress
I've got my bucci bag
I've got my bucci bag
I've got my lipstick on
I've got my lipstick on
I've got my bucci bag
I've got my bucci bag
