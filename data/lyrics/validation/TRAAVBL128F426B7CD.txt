Surely I am willing but I won't
Claiming that I'll do it but I don't
Knowing I'll do anything you want
Pretending I am someone that I'm not

Good God, my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I'm determined to create
These things up in my head
That never happen
In time I've gotta choose
Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you have done
What am I gonna do?

So now that you have made a mess of me
And showed me stars that
I have never seen
I know it's wrong why does it feel so right
You haven't got me yet
But you might

You're smiling back at me
I wanna do it
I wanna be with you
Let me get through it
Am I gonna make it back alive
When you show me all the things that you can do?

Good God, my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I'm determined to create
These things up in my head
That never happen
In time I've gotta choose
Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you have done
What am I gonna do?

Good God, my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I'm determined to create
These things up in my head
That never happened
In time I've gotta choose
Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you have done
What am I gonna do?
