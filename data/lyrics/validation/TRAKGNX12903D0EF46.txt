Long distance information
Give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number
But I know what place to call
Because my Uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis Tennessee
Her house is on the south side
High upon the ridge
Just about a half a mile
From the Mississippi bridge
Help me information
More than I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart
Because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home
In Memphis Tennessee
Last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her
In Memphis Tennessee
