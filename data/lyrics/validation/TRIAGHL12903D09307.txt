I'll set your ride on on a storm
I'll set you ridin on a storm
I'll set your ride on on a storm
I'll set you ridin on a storm

Don't you know that love will find you
Wherever you are
I'm in love and you're crushing
Everything you are
Don't you know that love will find you
Wherever you are
I'm in love and you're crushing
Everything you are

I'll set your ride on on a storm
I'll set you ridin on a storm
I'll set your ride on on a storm
I'll set you ridin on a storm
