"Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, today"

Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Are we evil, are we good?
Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Would you save them if you could?

What are the children to do with it?
Kill the mules in South America
This is the sewer where the filth unite
This is the place where Dark tramples the Light

It used to be pretty
Now it's such a pity
Brings out the animal in all of us
No more sad sob stories
No more preachin' and cryin'
Falling like soldiers of fortune

Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Are we evil, are we good?
Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Would you save them if you could?

It won't get any better, it will only get worse
Cry to God and plead the Fifth
Who's to blame for our demise?
Cleanse our hands from all the lies

It used to be pretty
Now it's such a pity
Brings out the animal in all of us
No more sad sob stories
No more preachin' and cryin'
Falling like soldiers of fortune

Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Are we evil, are we good?
Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Would you save them if you could?

This spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
Cain visits Able, the Earth, the meek
Lift up the children when you can
Jezzebel's cocaine in the devil's hands

It used to be pretty
Now it's such a pity
Brings out the animal in all of us
No more sad sob stories
No more preachin' and cryin'
Falling like soldiers of fortune

Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Are we evil, are we good?
Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Would you save them if you could?

Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Are we evil, are we good?
Dropping rattlesnakes in the playground
Would you save them if you could?
