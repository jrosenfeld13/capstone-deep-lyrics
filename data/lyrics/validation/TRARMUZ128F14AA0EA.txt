[Verse 1]
Hung up in Oakland on a Saturday night
Lord, I said I just didn't feel right (goodnight)
Goodnight, ladies all around
But the right one hadn't found me
Such a bad night (uptight)
I didn't feel right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then a friend came over 'fore it got too late
Asked me if I'd like you as a double date

[Chorus 1]
My stars above, I fell in love
With the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Yeah, the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

[Verse 2]
Now Queenie's a lady, she's quiet and shy
Oh, she'll make you feel fine (good time)
Remember the time that a trucker from Dallas
Was callous to Queenie with his rude side (suicide)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now he can't deny
That he got much more than he bargained before
Queenie's right across running to the floor

[Chorus 2]
Now he knows better than to mess
With the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
The queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

[Bridge]
Oh, as fast as a bullet (yeah), she can jam all night (yeah)
Makes a full grown thunderbird die with fright (yeah)
When we get home (yeah) alone in love (yeah)
She murmurs like a sweet mourning dove, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh, such a lady, she's quite a child
She'll make me feel good in this heart of mine

[Chorus - Outro]
She's my love, she's a lady
She's the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
My little queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
I'm talkin' 'bout the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Yeah, she's the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Oh, queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
She's the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Ooh
