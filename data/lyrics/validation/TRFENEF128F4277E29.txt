I'm afraid of the stars
When I gaze at the skies
My death is a flute
And it fills up my eyes

Do you wake in the night
To the eyes you don't see
To the horrible sound
Of your heart beating free

I do, Oh I do
No I do, I do

Should we listen to love
The emergency there
Leaves a man with a cane
At the end of the stairs

I embraced my ?????
And I throw myself in
I believe ????
To believe way I spin

I do, Oh I do
No I do, I do
