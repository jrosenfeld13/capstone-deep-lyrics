It's over now
You walk away
After goodbye there's nothing left to say
How could I miss by so much?
Did I finally lose my touch?
Or simply lose my way?

I guess it's true
You live and learn
Take one last look and watch
Your bridges burn
When did love leave me behind?
Did I lose what you seldom find?
Or simply lose my turn?

Next time I love
Won't be too soon
Next time I fall, I'll fall beneath a kinder moon
And should that moon turn cold
And fade away
I'll feel the chill
But still I'll stay

Next time I love
Next time I dance
Next time I fall, will these old feelings
Stand a change?
This lonely heart and I- we'll both survive
For I'll be whole, and so alive
Next time I love

A little prayer
Some compromise
A little time to grow a little wise
And should he ask me for more
Will I foolishly close the door
Or simply close my eyes

Next time I love
Won't be too soon
Next time I fall, I'll fall beneath
A kinder moon
And should that moon turn
Cold and fade away
I will hold on and find a way
Next time I love

Next time I lvoe
Next time I dance
Next time I fall will these old feelings
Stand a chance
This lonely heart and I- we'll both survive
For I'll be whole and so alive
Next time I love
