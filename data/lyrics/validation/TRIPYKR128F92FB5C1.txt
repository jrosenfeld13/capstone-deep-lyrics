A troubled mind in search
Of a bright neon bay
I swim to shore
The only route to take
Is perfection itself
The stars lead the way

As waves make oceans complete
Fate is the shell of my beat
O how I feel all that I need
Under my thoughts under my fears

Little things I know they're real

They make my soul complete

Little things and all they bring
Are fragments bitter sweet

Little things not everything
'Cause glitter is no goal
Simple things are all I need
A friend to guide to hold

If you should go
(Go now)

I find myself alone
With no center no home
But I won't close my eyes
The thing I love the most
I'm letting you go
But I won't give up hope
