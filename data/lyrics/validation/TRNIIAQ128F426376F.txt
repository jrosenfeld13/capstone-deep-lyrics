(Walt Aldridge/James LeBlanc)

Well it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun

And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Woo...

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side
Oh, Lord...such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Yeah...

Whoa
Well...
Woo...hoo
