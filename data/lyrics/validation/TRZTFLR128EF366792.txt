I never saw the profit
I never saw the ?
But I can see the faces and there living in my dreams
You people make the moment
You people turn the tide
This is the reason that we're here and still alive
Yeah it's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
It's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
I could not see the future
I could not see the change
But I can see the reason and its staring in my face
You people sing the sorrow
You people change the view
Make the connection cause
You bleed for us and we bleed for you
Yeah it's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
It's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
For you we take the burden
And for you we take the pain
For you we learn the lesson
And for you we fan the flames
For you we sing the sorrow
And for you we come alive
For you we tip the scales
And for you we turned the tide
This is for all those who live down in the basement
And this is for all those who are trapped underneath the pavement
And this is for all those still believing after all these years
And this is for all those who are still standing after the smoke clears
This song is for you
Yeah it's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
It's about time
It's about time
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
It's about time
We wrote this song for you
