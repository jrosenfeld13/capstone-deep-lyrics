If I said something smoothly, could it be a little symphony
Breathing a break, oh that's what you want me to do
Riding along emotions unaware of my own age, darling

Lauren, I'm growing much faster than you

And if that Andy drew my soul, I will tear me 'till I'm dry
Poetic drivel, oh, that's what I want it to be
How can a girl so strong, go and blow it on her own, darling

Lauren, I'm growing much faster than you

And if that cunt tries to beat me in rhythm
And if that cunt tries to prove me I'm wrong
I'm sure that

Lauren I'm growing much faster than you
