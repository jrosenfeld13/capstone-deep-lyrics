No teacher to follow
No prophet to tell me how
But I know what I want
I know what I want now

Like water, it rushes
It's the last thing you see
When you close your eyes
It's the one place you want to be

But if it doesn't brush my shoulder
And it doesn't beat my heart
That's not what I want, no
That's not where I will start
I never kissed somebody
So that they would break my heart
That's not what I want

If you don't know what you're missing
'cause you don't know where to start
Follow your wishing heart

I was restless, I was restless
I was restless, I was restless
I just want this to be good
I just want this to be good
But you don't understand
You don't understand me
And I want to be understood

But if it doesn't brush my shoulder
And it doesn't beat my heart
That's not what I want, no
That's not where I will start
I never kissed somebody
So that they would break my heart
That's not what I want

If we all leap before
We crawl, we might fall
And it's not always candy
Spun from head to heart
And it's not always meant to be
And it's not always up to me

But if it doesn't brush my shoulder
And it doesn't beat my heart
That's not what I want, no
That's not where I will start
I never kissed somebody
So that they would break my heart
That's not what I want

If you don't know what you're missing
'cause you don't know where to start
You don't know what you're missing
Follow your wishing heart
