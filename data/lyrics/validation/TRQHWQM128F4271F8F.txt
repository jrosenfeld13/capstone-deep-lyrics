No the days just glide in
The eyes rest in the sky
I hear lies

The tones just come here
Try to make it my home
I need to praise
Them dreams that I erase

Oh father don't wake me up
Don't try to wake me up
Don't wake me up

And you people just live on rails
I can't fix my time or space
I can't take place

Oh father just wake me up
Just wake me up

Oh father don't wake me up
Don't try to wake me up
Don't wake me up
