Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengence is boiling
He's Returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon!

Ha Ha Ha

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon!
Hey, yeah, Bark at the moon!

They cursed and burried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning hell - Unholy One
But he's returned to prove them wrong, So wrong
Oh, Yeah Babay!

Howling In shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He fins his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon!

Hey, Yeah Bark at the moon!
Hey, Yeah Bark at the moon!
Oh, yeahHey, Yeah Bark at the moon!
