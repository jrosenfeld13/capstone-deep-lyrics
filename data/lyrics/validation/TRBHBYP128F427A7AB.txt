On the legs of lightning
The storm rears in defeat
Rising in vain once more with the sea
Grey hand's reaching
Cold under the swell
Withered in the forge of our unbelief

All gods breed
All gods die
All gods will pay

We'll exorcise
All of these fathers of lies
Burned holes for eyes
Behold the pyre of gods

Uncrusaders, heretics to all faith
No slavery beyond death
Every idol will feel our scourge
They can't hold us in this life

All gods breed
All gods die
All gods will pay

We'll exorcise
All of these fathers of lies
Burned holes for eyes
Behold the pyre of gods

The ransom of your soul
Must be paid for your dead
The way out for us all
We'll take the jailer's head

All gods want
All gods need
Their sacrifices must bleed
All gods breed
All gods die
All gods will pay

We'll exorcise
All of these fathers of lies
Burned holes for eyes
Behold the pyre of gods

We'll exorcise
All of these fathers of lies
Burned holes for eyes
Behold the pyre of gods
