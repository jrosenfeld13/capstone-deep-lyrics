I know what it takes
To break you
And then sweep the proof away
You know there is no escape

The hunter and the pray
Become one whenever we embrace
Love is the strangest place
Wherever you hide
I will find and capture you
You won't sleep tonight
Cuz I am wide awake
What I want I take so

Stop don't talk
I have decided
Girls on top
Don't try to fight it
Won't give up not till you try it
It's my turn tonight
We're like
Fire and water
One might
Burns out the other
You can't stop
Yourself forever
Girls on top tonight

The place is mine to trade
So let's make
The master become the slave
Love can go either way
I'll lay you down
I'll take care of everything
So open your eyes
And I'll show you what
You're imagining so...

Stop don't talk
I have decided
Girls on top
Don't try to fight it
Won't give up not till you try it
It's my turn tonight
We're like
Fire and water
One might
Burns out the other
You can't stop
Yourself forever
Girls on top tonight(x2)

Stop don't talk
Don't give up
Girls on top
We can't stop
No don't talk
Till' we stop
Yeah...

Stop don't talk
I have decided
Girls on top
Don't try to fight it
Won't give up not till you try it
It's my turn tonight
We're like
Fire and water
One might
Burns out the other
You can't stop
Yourself forever

Girls on top tonight(x2)
