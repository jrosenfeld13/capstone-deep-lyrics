I should have known better than to expect it all
You want everything and you end up grabbing at air
I had so much to give so much hope, we held each other high
But the heroes are gone and all that's left is you and me
I learned the hard way that life should be easy
But I want you to know that it was hard to show the things that I know now

All that's left is you and me and here we are nowhere
All that's left is you and me and here we are nowhere
