Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing
In my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything's right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Woke up late one Thursday
I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But had to stop from the shock of what I found
The room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
And I thought hello new shoes, bye bye blues
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn
Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Oh hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
