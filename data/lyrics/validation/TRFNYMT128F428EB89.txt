Mother and daughter fighting it out
Who's gonna stay home tonight
Who wears the make up, hangs on the phone
It always seems to end in a fight
It don't seem long since momma was a child bride

She got married in a hurry
Sixteen years old on the day
Ooh what a wedding, driving 'til dawn
With a rock n'roll band to play
She wore black when daddy gave the the bride away

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's getting married but she's still her daddy's little girl

Now the years roll by - the family brings
Big changes onto the scene
Sweet sixteen's turned thirty four
But boy, she's still the same little queen
Life's full of trips - she's gonna follow every dream

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl

Mother and daughter fighting it out
Who's gonna get their own way
Doctor says, "Take it easy now
Take two of these every day."
Doctor, doctor, you can throw your pills away

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl
