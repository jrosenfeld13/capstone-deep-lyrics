Off with our heads
They wanna see blood
We come down with a heavy and hollow thud
They'll work their way through all of our bones
A generation of people throwing stones

We'll never see this place again
I will see to it
No-one will ever find us here
We'll never see this place again
I will see to it
No-one will ever find us here
No, no, no, no

We'll start a fire in every home
We'll start a fire in every soul
So call the cavalry
Yes call the cavalry
No

We'll never see this place again
I will see to it
No-one will ever find us here
We'll never see this place again
I will see to it
No-one will ever find us here
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
