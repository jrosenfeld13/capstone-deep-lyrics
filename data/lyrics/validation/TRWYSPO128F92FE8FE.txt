He'd beat her up to come, she ran around
She shot him and they laid him in the ground
There's two children left without a home
Wondering what in world is going on

Guilty of murder first degree
Rushy mountain penitentiary
There's two children left without a home
Wondering what in world is going on

=CHORUS=
Who showed who
Who played it smart
One in jail one in the grave with a bullet through the heart

Who showed who
Who's right or wrong
Two children left without a home
=CHORUS=

Well I guess the tragic happenings never end
You don't think these things happen to your friend
Well I thought I knew them both so very well
But he's in the grave and she's in a cell

I guess they both found they were justified
But I can't say that I saw either side
But for Tommy and Mary right or wrong
There's two children left without a home

=CHORUS=
Who showed who
Who played it smart
One in jail one in the grave with a bullet through the heart

Who showed who
Who's right or wrong
Two children left without a home
