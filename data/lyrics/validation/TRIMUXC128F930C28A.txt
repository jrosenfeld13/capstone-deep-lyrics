I'm so sick of TV
You know, I'm getting bored of the tube
And I'm so sick of romance
I'm getting real sick of you

I wanna get on out of here
And find something to do
Yeah get on out of here
Just ain't nothin' to do

Listen
I'm so sick of FM
I don't play my stereo too
Just wanna get out on the street fight free
That is something to do

Wanna get on out of here
Ain't nothin' to do
Yeah get on out of here
Just ain't nothin' to do

There ain't nothin' to do
I gonna beat up the next yuppie I see
Maybe I'll be beating up you
Here I come baby
In your mouth

Ain't nothin' to do
Ain't nothin' to do

There ain't nothin' to do
Gonna knock down the next suit I see
Maybe I'll be knocking down you

Ain't nothin' to do
Ain't nothin' to do
Ain't nothin' to do
