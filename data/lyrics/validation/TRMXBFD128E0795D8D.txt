Flocking to the sea
Crowds of people wait for me
Sea gulls scavenge
Steal ice cream
Worries vanish
Within my dream

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

Fishing boats sail past the shore
No singing may-day any more
The sun is shining
The Water's clear
Just you and I walk along the pier

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

A cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
Some get stung it's worth the cost
I'd love to stay
The city calls me home
More hassles fuss and lies on the phone

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Living free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
Living, living
And I, living, by the sea
