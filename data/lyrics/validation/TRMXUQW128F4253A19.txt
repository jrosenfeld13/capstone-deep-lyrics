When i think of you you know i think of rotten fruit
The world would be a better place if you were born a mute
That old time rock n roll is something we could do without
Kill Bob Seger right now, Kill Bob Seger right now

I like to take your records and i throw them in the trash
I wanna cut your brakes and make your tour bus crash
You think you're like a rocker i dont get you any how
Kill Bob Seger right now, Kill Bob Seger right now

When i think of you you know i think of rotten fruit, KILL
The world would be a better place if you were born a mute
That old time rock n roll song is something we could do without
Kill Bob Seger right now, Kill Bob Seger right now, Kill Bob Seger Right Now. OOOHHHH
Kill die, kill die, kill die, kill bob die
