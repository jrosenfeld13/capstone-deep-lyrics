The nights are long
And the days roll into each other
In the city of angels I can't get no sleep
I wish that I was sipping coffee in your kitchen
Yeah I'm stormy from the mountains to the sea

Left her standing
At the gate
Couldn't talk I was running so late
Thought I heard her say goodbye
Saw the sun fade in her eyes

Chorus

I brought my rain to California
All the way from Philadelphia, PA
And on the way my tears fell for you
I brought my rain to Cali, oh Cali, California

Wandering down to sunset strip in the morning
6 a.m. is that a rainbow that I see?
I interrupt my own damn conversation
Yeah I'm talking to myself at the Whiskey

(Chorus)
Inside this heart that smiles no more
Lies the ghost of a love so beautiful
And all the time
The rain inside my mind
Goes on and on and on and on and on

(Chorus)
