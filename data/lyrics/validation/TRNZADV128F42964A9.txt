[Verse 1: Substantial]
(Its Showtime) strap yourself in
Once the rapping begin you can start packing in
(Im a goldmine) watch him drop gems
Got them rocking, popping, locking
(Closed minds) I open them wide
The quotes that I write have you hoping I died
Got you open tonight lets go for a ride
(Sky high) from the dope I provide
(Why try) that would really be silly duke
Cant you see that they clearly aint feeling you
Lyrically leaving crews visibly miserable
(Hes too invincible) these dudes are pitiful
Giving you heat since Invisible man
And to this union you know who I am
All Nighter (raw writer)
Pyro rhyme flow (more fire)!!!

Are you making the face yet?
Dropped in 1st round go get his replacement
(Albums finally here youve been patient)
Though you wanted it so bad you can taste it
Took my time with it the vision was beautiful
Couldnt just hit it as business as usual
Something exquisite so its just more musical
Sad this caliber of hip-hop is new to you
(Who is you?) Substantial the merciless
One of the nicest they dont mean I courteous
Dont get beat down til youre bluish and purplish
Doubting my skill cause you never heard of this
(Purposeless hate) Youre truly wor-th-less
Only crew you gots emergency services
Murdered it Berkowitz style (The Summer of Stan)
Now give it up for your man

If it moves you
Why not move two
Better yet three
Or four get me

[Verse 3: Substantial]
Im from the place where music was cranking before it was crunk
Life is an elevator Joe live it up
(U.V. is here) til youre sick of us
On some Neosporin shit (we in the cut)
Til we peel like a scab! Rappers
Like strippers revealing their ass!
Thats only surface but whats with your inner beginner
Remember to spit from your soul
Spit something cold as Cube in his prime
Why would I sell out Im doing just fine
Perusing no crime doing no time
Donnan Links gave me a tune thats sublime
(So hate on!) But you know what your momma think
You sensitive sounding real soft and pink
Cause I stole the show before you blinked
Plus wifeys a fan you saw her wink
