50 Cent - Amusment Park
Shorty you ain't gotta take 'em panties off just move it to the side
If you wanna ride on a roller coaster baby come on and ride
It goes up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its only night I know what you like
And I just had a break yall
Good Evening Ladies I tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities fun things to do
And now I find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast some rides go slow
If your heights went up high HELL yeah I go low
It tastes so sweet let's dig in cotton candy
If we get carried away we'd be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl you know there's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now it's the first half of my act
Started as a pimp now I'm more like a mack
I don't need your paper just don't f**k with my stats
Oh it's like that Yeah it's like that
Shorty you ain't gotta take 'em panties just move it to the side
If you wanna ride on a roller coaster baby come on and ride
It goes up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its only night I know what you like
And I just had a break yall
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions Trojans all in the hotel
Put me to the test girl I don't fail
I work it out
Without a doubt
There's plenty water rising I'm sure it'll get you wet in the pot
Have your luster's seduction considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like you know I don't care
I really want to thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak put up your hands sincere
And your pass is valid all summer my dear
So watch everything that you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, Lick that, Swallow that lollipop
Forget that, Brick that, Ride it non-stop
Shorty you ain't gotta take 'em panties off just move it to the side
If you wanna ride on a roller coaster baby come on and ride
It goes up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
Its only night I know what you like
And I just had a break yall
