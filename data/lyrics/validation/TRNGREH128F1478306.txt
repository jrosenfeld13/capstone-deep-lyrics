[Verse 1]
I rather face all on top of my face
I am the perfect target screen
For your blindly fueled rage
I bare the brunt of your long buried pain
I don't mind helping you out
But I want you to remember my name

[Chorus]
It's not all me
It's not all my fault
I need remind you
But I won't take it all on

[Verse 2]
Past riddled rage
I see the buttons I engage
With my dignity in place?
I'm all too happy to switch

[Chorus]
It's not all me
It's not all my fault
I need remind you
But I won't take it all on

[Verse 3]
Lest I find my voice
Find the strength to stand up to you
Lest I stay to my limit
And take on only what is mine to
We are a team
I'm here to help mend and rescind
All I trigger unknowingly
A job I hold in high esteem

[Chorus]
It's not all me
It's not all my fault
I need remind you
But I won't take it all on
It's not all me
It's not all my fault
I need remind you
But I won't take it all on
I'll only take some of it
