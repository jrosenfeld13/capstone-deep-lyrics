Where do you wanna go
Take me home, bring me down
Listen to all my jokes tonight

Oh we could have some fun
Let me see, do you have a plan
There is nothing else to do, tonight

Take me home, bring me down tonight
Take me home, bring me down

Is there anything
I can do to change your mind
I'm just a wreck when I'm with you

Let me play this song
Listen know, it's getting on
Take me anywhere you want, tonight

Take me home, bring me down
Take me home, bring me down tonight
Take me home, bring me down
Take me home, bring me down tonight

I'm faking everything I say
I'm faking everything I do, tonight

Take me home, bring me down
I'm faking everything I say
Take me home, bring me down tonight
I'm Faking everything I say
Take me home, bring me down
I'm faking evertyhing I do
Take me home, bring me down tonight

Take me home tonight(x3)
