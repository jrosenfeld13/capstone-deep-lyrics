Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
Unless you're mad, don't explain
Quite, don't explain
What is there to gain
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain
You know that I love you
And what loving does
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm completely yours
Try to hear folks chatter
Cause I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet
Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and my pain
My life'is your love
Don't explain
You know that I love you
And what loving does
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm completely yours
Try to hear folks chatter
Cause I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet
Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy,you're my pain
My life's your love
Don't explain
