Like snow
Like everything I feel
The world keeps turning

My hands
My hands are all I see
No path under my feet

I'm falling
I'm falling

One light
One light in all this time
The world keeps turning
I try
I try my best to see
And it follows me

It's calling
It's calling

Like snow
Like everything I feel
The world keeps turning

My hands
My hands are all I see
No path under my feet

I'm falling
I'm falling
