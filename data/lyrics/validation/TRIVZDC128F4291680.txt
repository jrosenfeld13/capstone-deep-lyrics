Walk away don't say good-bye
Turn around don't let it die
Love will find the way to you
Feelings and emotions
Are just like stormy ocean
Can you stay the way you are
Heaven knows you come so far
Love will find the way to you
So promise me forever
There'll never be a never

Baby don't don't give up
If your heart is broken
Make a brand-new start
Baby don't don't give up
Count to ten
Start again

Don't give up hold on tight
On the way see the light
Don't give up hold on tight
Let your love make it right
Don't give up hold on tight
Don't leave love out of sight
Then you'll never be alone

Need a friend so count on me
All the things in life for free
Love will find the way to you
Baby keep on tryin'
Love will keep on flyin'
Thou you think you lost your way
Tomorrow is another day
Love will find the way to you
Shadows will be fallin'
Dreams keep on callin'
