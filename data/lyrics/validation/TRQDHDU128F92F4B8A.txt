I received a letter just today
From someone close to me so far away
My heart started poundin', I begun to pray
As I opened up the letter and read what she had to say

She said, Darlin
The letter said, darlin' I love you
Yes, I love you
Bein' apart is breakin' my heart and killin' me
Your picture used to help some
Now it just makes me blue
And everywhere I look I find bits and pieces
Memories of you
