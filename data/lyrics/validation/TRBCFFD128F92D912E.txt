What hope for a generation?
Grown up behind the bars
What can history teach us?
When its covered with scars
We learn to swim
But were swimming with sharks
Time is hard, you better
Trust no shadow after dark

Theyll imprison your soul
Imprison your mind
Cause today you learn to kill
Tomorrow to be kind
They sure know how to bite
Without leaving a mark
Time is hard, you better
Trust no shadow after dark

Small hopes to resist my friend
We've already marked
Do what you got to do just to try
Small hopes to resist
The only left reason to live
Is a reason to survive

Small hopes to resist, my friend
Were already marked
You watch them burn it all in flames
Once just a spark
You watch them build a graveyard
Out of a park
Time is hard, you better
Trust no shadow after dark
