When I'm with you I'm falling
Peace is a word of the sea and the wind
Peace is a word of a day without end
Searching for a new dawn
I dwell in the unrest
Violence breeds peace
Through chemicals and meditation
I find my self
Denying society and the laws of undoing
Our temple of denial
Perversion is insanity
Lust for rape, a reality
Body scarred
Head f*cked up
Don't get involved
Sado-necro-homo-bestiality
