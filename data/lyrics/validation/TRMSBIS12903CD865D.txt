Night is like a hand
That feeds our lust
Darkness, like a temple of love
No sorrow in us
Stars above make us feel alive tonight
Wake up when night drives sun away
Feel the rush burn in our veins
Fall asleep before the dawn
Hearts ache
Under a velvet sky
Faces look cruel in daytime
And we are weak under the sun
We're strangers in the middle of the day
You are the moonshine child
And I am the one
Who's been blinded by the daylight
Come and follow me
Wake up when night drives sun away
Feel the rush burn in our veins
Fall asleep before the dawn
Hearts ache
Under a velvet sky
