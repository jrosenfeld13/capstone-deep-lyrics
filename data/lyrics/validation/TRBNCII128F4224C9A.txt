Shadows are playing with the light
All that I see
Drive me into this agony
Time blows the life far away
I follow this strange symphony

Dust nothing more then dust
Dust dust everything is fast
Dust so much is lost
Dust dust everything is dust

Time ain't a devil to fight
Looking forwards
Drive me into this agony
Something is wrong in your... mind
Time takes you away
With this symphony... symphony

Dust nothing more then dust
Dust dust everything is fast
Dust so much is lost
Dust dust everything is dust
