I retreat
By myself at the back of my brain
I cannot see
What You're showing me through this pain
I have found
That i have found
Nothing for so long

Chorus
I don't understand
I don't need to
I know You've a plan
You will see through
It is in Your hands
I believe You

I say goodbye
I leave my loved ones far behind
I'm asking
Why is this is the story of my life
I have found
That i have found
Nothing for so long

Chorus

I was only wondering
I've been trying to understand
I know there is more
So much more than i can see

Chorus 2x
