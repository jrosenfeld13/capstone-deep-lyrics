[Verse 1]
Are you ready for a good pounding baby?
Get down
Are you ready to get it on?
Get down, get down
Don't pretend you're not fucking freaky baby
Get down
I will spank that ass just for fun
Get down on the ground

[Chorus]
Ass up high!
Make a motherfucker cry!
It's so good that I could die!
Help me stay alive!
The time is right!
I want to feel it good and tight!
I'm down to do this all night!
I'm gonna beat it upright!

[Verse 2]
I'll behave!
Oh my God!
Make me beg!
My God!
Yes I'm ready for a good flogging baby
My God, get down
Come on beat my ass just for fun
Get down, my God, get down
Don't let up till my ass is bleeding baby
My God, get down
Don't let up until you are done
Get down on the ground

[Chorus]
Ass up high!
Make a motherfucker cry!
It's so good that I could die!
Help me stay alive!
The time is right!
I want to feel it good an tight!
I'm down to do this all night!
I'm gonna beat it upright!

[Verse 3]
We're going on a ride
I'm gonna turn you inside out, upside down
Don't try to run and hide
Yes it's true what they say about my kind
Are you ready for a good pounding baby?
Get down
Are you ready to get it on?
Get down, get down
Don't pretend you're not fucking freaky baby
Get down
I will spank that ass just for fun
Get down on the ground

[Chorus]
Ass up high!
Make a motherfucker cry!
It's so good that I could die!
Help me stay alive!
The time is right!
I want to feel it good and tight!
I'm down to do this all night!
I'm gonna beat it upright!
