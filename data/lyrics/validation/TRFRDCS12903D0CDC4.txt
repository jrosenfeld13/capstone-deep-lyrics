The radio's on
But I'm sittin' in the backyard
The feeling isn't gone
Oh, you know it's going to be so hard
To do what I've got to do
When the rooster next door says "Cock-a-doodle do"
I'll forget about him

I'll forget about him (Don't worry)
I'll forget about him (You betcha)
I'll forget about him

The flowers are in bloom
Well it just makes me more lonely
There's too much damn room
For me and for me only
I always thought that my love was enough
Now I know that it's going to be rough rough rough
To forget about him

I'll forget about him (Don't worry)
I'll forget about him (I'll do it)
I'll forget about him

Well have you forgotten
Have you forgotten yet?
No, not yet
The sun's on the horizon
Goin' down, down

Baby, where you goin'
Hey, where you goin'
Honey, where you goin'
Hey, when you comin' back
When you comin' back?

You're just a speck moving through the fields
When you comin' back, back

There's a boy up the road
And he wants to take me out some
Well he doesn't know
That I'm not gonna be too much fun
'Cause when he kisses me I'm gonna cry
I do believe that I'm gonna have to die
To forget about him

I'll forget about him (I'll do it)
I'll forget about him (Don't worry)
I'll forget about him

If I forget about him I'll be on easy street
And my feet will walk with a breezy beat
If I forget about, forget about, forget about him
If I forget about him and I'm gonna do it
And the whole crazy world is gonna be brand new
I'll forget a-, forget a-, forget about him

Well have you forgotten
Have you forgotten yet?
No, not yet
The sun's on the horizon going down, down, down, down
