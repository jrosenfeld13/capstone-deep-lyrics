Let me tell you of a dream I had
Sweating one late summer's night
I couldn't believe what I was seeing
From where I lay inside

When I awoke from my slumber
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I awoke from my sleep
The clouds had fallen from the sky (x2)

As if whales had poured from the sea
It seemed the clouds poured from the sky
And laid on the beach so breathlessly
And patiently waited to die

Now the air, it sticks
The air, it sweats
The air, it blocks all the light
The air looks like it did in my dreams
As I lay bed that night (x2)

As if whales had poured from the sea
It seemed the clouds had poured from the sky
And laid upon the beach so breathlessly
And patiently waited to die

Everyone's asking around
About a beautiful world they knew
Me, I just look toward the ground
And the clouds cover my shoe

When I awoke from my slumber
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I awoke from my sleep
The clouds had fallen from the sky (x2)
