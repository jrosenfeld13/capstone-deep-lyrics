We're old enough for leaving home
The old Joanna and the old trombone
It's all going on, I'm growing my sideboards long
Hey, you and me can be who we want to be
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Calling it a teenage scene and I have a dream
Don't know if I'll be a star and I'm gonna play guitar
I've seen this rocking cat, I wanna be just like that
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy youre no child
Look at you baby
We can get wild, oh yeah
We'll be on our own, Billy Fury on a gramophone
Take you to the pictures and a dance in my drainpipe pants
Check the mirror and the old DA and you can play in a day
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey, look at you baby
We can get wild
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey, look at you baby
We can get wild
Hey, we can get wild
We can get wild
Get wild
