[Verse 1]
Run desire, run, sexual being
Run him like a blade to and through the heart
No conscience, one motive
Cater to the hollow

[Chorus]
Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up, again
And temporarily pacify this hungering

[Verse 2]
So grow, libido, throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming, conquer and devour

[Bridge]
'Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

[Chorus]
Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up, again
And temporarily pacifying

Feed me, here
Fill me up, again
And temporarily pacifying
