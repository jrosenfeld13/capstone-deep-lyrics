The way she made love, me haffi request more
She gave me even on the wooden floor

Nuff compliments and me bounce her right

I'm heading over heels just for you
Loving every single thing you do
Clearly I can see you want me too
Lately I've been talking to my self
Saying, "I don't need nobody else"
"Cause all I'm searching for I found in you"

Without you in my bed
'Cause when you're not around, my love
It's messing up my head
Baby...
