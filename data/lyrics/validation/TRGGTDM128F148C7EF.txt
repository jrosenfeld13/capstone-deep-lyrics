Blue, eyeshadow girls smoking in the bathroom
They're gonna meet out on the dirt road at a quarter till two
Whispers, whispers echo through the stall
Hey isn't that her? isn't she the one?

I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to be a wierdo
Don't want to be misunderstood
I just try to be good

Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad you'd be a big sensation
Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad you'd be a big sensation

Cool dude, thinks that he's a lady killer
High school girls fighting over him at the end of the road
They don't care, if he's ten years older and a loser
Already been married three times before

I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to be a wierdo
Don't want to be misunderstood
I just try to be good

Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad, you'll be a big sensation
Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad, you'll be a big big sensation

I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to be a wierdo
Don't want to be misunderstood
I just try to be good

Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad, you'll be a big sensation
Why does everybody want a bad reputation?
You're so bad, You're so bad, You're so bad
You're so bad
