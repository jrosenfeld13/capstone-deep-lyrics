[Chorus]
Maybe you and I cannot do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

[Verse 1]
Empty words are not enough
Where there is hurt we will be a crush
When there is thirst we will fill each other is cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
In despair we will be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We will be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you will see
Love is all we need

[Chorus]
