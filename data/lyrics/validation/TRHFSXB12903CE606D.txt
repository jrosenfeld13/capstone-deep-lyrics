Sad with what I have
Never met a more unimpressed, depressed lad
Blue boy doesn't have a thing on me

Sad with what I have
Never met a more repressed
Motionless cad
Bluebeard doesn't have a thing for me

Then I think of you
How could someone so bright love someone so blue?
Guess the world needs what I have
And what you do

Guess the world needs both the sun
And the moon too
Sad with what I have except for you
