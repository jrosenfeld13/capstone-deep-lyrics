(Written by Tommy Page & L. Russel Brown)
You say you've got to go and there'll be no
Turning back, oh no
Don't know the reason why you're leaving
Though it hurts me so
Wherever you turn, whatever you do
Under the rainbow, I'll be waiting for you
I watch you walk away and I think about the yesterday
We shared but I hold on to the only
Part of you that's there
It's memories, I'm holding on to
So under the rainbow, I keep waiting for you
Chorus
I'll be, under the rainbow
I'll stay, under the rainbow
Well you know that it's true, whatever you do
Under the rainbow, I'll be waiting for you
My friends keep telling me that you're never coming
Back again and
They say that you have found another
Where the rainbow ends
But I don't believe, what they're saying is true
So under the rainbow, I keep waiting for you
And even if it's gonna take forever
I'll wait as long as I have to
My dream's for us to be back together
So under the rainbow, under the rainbow, under the rainbow
I'll be waiting for you
The color of my world's turned a misty blue
Ever since the day you found somebody new
And even if it's gonna take forever my whole life through
You'll see, I'll be, waiting for you
