When the storms of life are raging stand by me
When the storms of life are raging stand by me
When the world is tossing me like a ship upon the sea
Thou who rulest wind and water stand by me
When the midst of tribulation stand by me when the midst of tribulation stand by me
When the hosts of hell assail and my strength begins to fail
Thou who never lost a battle stand by me

When the midst of faults and failures stand by me
When the midst of faults and failures stand by me
When I do the best I can and my friends misunderstand
Thou who knowest all about me stand by me
When I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
When I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
When my life becomes a burden and I'm nearing chilly Jordan
O Thou Lily of the Valley stand by me (stand by me)
