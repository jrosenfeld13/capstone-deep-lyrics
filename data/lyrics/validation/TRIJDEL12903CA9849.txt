[Verse 1] (Metropolis)
Oh, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Mmm girl you look good
All up on my engine shaking those goods
Love to take you out on a date if I could
Maybe let me give you a taste of my wood
Dang, got back like a return trip, measure and smack
Now that's something I could work with
Can I pain you for a lap around your circuit
All this work you're putting in is definitely worth it
Hella, brothers a fiend for the market
Pray tell momma, there a fee for the service (psyche)
I'm so bang on the (?)
Not sure about your face but your ass is perfect
Aww don't get tight, I'm just pulling your leg
And if you're having doubts, I want to put you to bed
I mean put them to bed, you got me all confused
Horny as a billy goat hungry for the screw
Tell me, what can i do, You're looking so damn ohh
Just wanna stick my face in that peach and go brr
You might have guessed I'm sleazy
Gets deep underneath those sheets, believe me
Hope you're rocking thongs or a clean bikini
I'm meaning to slide something inbetween, fosheezy
Yeah, you gotta be a freak to please me
Don't (?) whether you're an ice queen or easy

[Chorus] (Metropolis)
Just shake it
Love it when you move where your waist is
Got me in the mood for the taste, yeah
And now I've got to see you all naked
Gotta base it, but just (shake it)

Love it when you move where your waist is
Got me in the mood for the taste, yeah
Maybe you're a little too wasted
And you ain't fit, but still (shake it)

[Verse 2] (Orifice Vulgatron)
I must have seen her in the club
Looking all tick, or should I say buff
No word of a bluff
She had the backstop to get the man in a whoo
Must have pulled up to the bump
Bust a couple miracle biggies to set it up
Told her lickle ting, what's feeling to hit her right
So she leaned in my ear saying (oh I like it rough)
Oh, I said 'girl you nasty'
Wait until I get up in those fancy panties
She was all about the hanky panky
Little did I know about the spanky spanky
She must have led me out the back door
Look at her eyes like oh you must have a crack whore
She was all about the crack talk
Told me how shes gonna be backing until her backs sore
Damn, I wasn't ready for the cuts
Ready for the whips and chains and other stuff
I was in the zone, thought we'd be making love
That's when the bit flips and I told you (I like it rough)
Ow, ow, ow, ow, oh, get off, ow, ow, ow ,ow, ow
Stop it, stop it, get off me, oww

[Chorus] (Metropolis)
Shake it
Love it when you move where your waist is
Got me in the mood for the taste, yeah
And now I've got to see you all naked
Gotta base it, but just (shake it)

Love it when you move where your waist is
Got me in the mood for the taste, yeah
Maybe you're a little too wasted
And you ain't fit, but still (shake it)

It's what you really want
It's what you really need
Now shake it, let me see
Shake it

It's what you really want
It's what you really need
Now shake it, let me see
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it
