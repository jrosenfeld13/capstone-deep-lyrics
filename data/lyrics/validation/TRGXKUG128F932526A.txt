You say you want a piece of me
You wanna be king of the hill
You're gonna have to pay your dues
Before you move in for the kill

Been on the streets since I was fifteen
I know every trick of the trade
I've crawled and scratched to get what I got
And you ain't gonna take it away

So come on I tell you
Just step across that line
I'll show you what I mean
Want a woman
I'll drag you through the dirt
Banging on your knees
Cause when you mess with me
You're messin' with a hurricane

So you think you've got what it takes
And you think you're gonna win
Well you better check my history
Before your losing battle begins

Other cats are trying to step in
Walking through the gates of hell
Well they had to learn their lesson the hard way
And now I gotta teach you as well

So come on I tell you
Just step across that line
I'll show you what I mean
Want a woman
I'll drag you through the dirt
Banging on your knees
Cause when you mess with me
You're messin' with a hurricane

Cruel wind won't let you survive
You're taking your life in your hands
You'll never get out alive
You're messin' with a hurricane

Oh ho!
Yeah yeah

Come on I tell you
Just step across that line
I'll show you what I mean
Want a woman
I'll drag you through the dirt
Banging on your knees
Cause when you mess with me
You're messin' with a hurricane

Messin' with a hurricane
