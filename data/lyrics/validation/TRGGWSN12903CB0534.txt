Burn it straight to the ground, to hell with this whole town transplanted youth now living in shit, gotten so bad that i just can't take it. tradition, a bastard among the rest. bullshit, a true state of disgrace. staring down the eye of the storm, i know this will never be my home. i hate this place, is rotting inside. what do you expect, raised with no pride
