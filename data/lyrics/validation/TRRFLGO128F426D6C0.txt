Freeze - thaw
Slow but sure
It breaks my heart

Either - or
Make up your mind
I'm hanging on

If I counted all the times
You are as sure as me
I'd give you up for someone else
Whose heart was free

When you change your tune
With every mood
What am I to do with you

Freeze - thaw
Freeze and thaw
Don't love and ignore me

Come and go
When you want
I never know

I open up
You close me down
We're out of time

When you show the other side
It warms the heart of me
But there again
It's not enough
To keep my love

When you change your tune
With every mood
What am I to do with you

Freeze - thaw
Freeze and thaw
Don't love and ignore me

Freeze - thaw
Slow but sure
It breaks my heart

Either - or
Make up your mind
I'm hanging on

When you change your tune
With every mood
What am I to do with you
