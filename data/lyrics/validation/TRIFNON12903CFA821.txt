Something burns inside me
Something uncontained
Breaks through the ice within me
This fire is to blame
Something's pulled me under
Feral and untamed
Never stopped to question
The nature of the game

Chorus:
My name is Loss of Conscience
My name is No Regret
My name is Nothing Matters
At least it hasn't yet

I wish intentions mattered
I wish I'd never seen
I wish the light had never
Made the truth so clear to me

Do our intentions matter
You'll wish you'd never seen
You'll wish the light had never
Blinded you so easily
