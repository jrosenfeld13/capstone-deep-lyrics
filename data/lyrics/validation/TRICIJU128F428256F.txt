Written by bob welch

Now I dont care if I get burned
Loving you is what comes first
Although youve heard a thousand lies
Please believe me for tonight

Do you know youre magic
Yeah, you little star
Walkin? through the world
Breakin? peoples heart
Do you know youre magic
Yeah, you little star
Well, shine on, shine on

Back and forth across my heart
I wont forget you, little star

Little star

I dont care if I get burned
Loving you is what comes first
I dont care if I get burned
Loving you

Although youve heard it a hundred times
Believe me, darling, so have i
But now lets live just for tonight
And let tomorrow take ist time

Repeat chorus

Back and forth across my heart
I wont forget you, little star
Little star
