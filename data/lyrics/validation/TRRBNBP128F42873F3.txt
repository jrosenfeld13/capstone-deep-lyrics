[Chorus]
Youre pushing me out
Youre pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
Youve pushed me down
Youve pushed me down
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you

[Verse 1]
This distance wont keep your words from screaming my name
This distance wont keep your words from smothering me
If I could keep you out (I'd only be [?])
If I could keep you... (I'd only be...)

[Chorus]
Youre pushing me out
Youre pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
Youve pushed me down
Youve pushed me down
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you

[Verse 2]
Your throat is worn away
Youre still screaming my name
You scream relentlessly
If I could keep you out (I'd only [?])
If I could keep you... (I'd only be...)

[Chorus]
Youre pushing me out
Youre pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
Youve pushed me down
Youve pushed me down
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you

[Bridge]
You pushed me then pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
You pushed me then pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
You pushed me then pulled me back
Back to where we started
Back to where we started
Lost, confused from this abuse
Back to where we...

[Chorus]
Youre pushing me out
Youre pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
Youve pushed me down
Youve pushed me down
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you

[Breakdown]
Youve pushed me out
Youve pushed me out (Ill try and Ill try again)
(Ill try and Ill try again for you)
Youve pushed me out
Youve pushed me out (Ill try and Ill try again)
(Ill try and Ill try again for you)

[Verse 3]
You pushed me then you pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you
You pushed me then you pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
Well Ill try and Ill try again
Ill try and Ill try again for you
