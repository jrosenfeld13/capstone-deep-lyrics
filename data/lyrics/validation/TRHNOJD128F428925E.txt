"OK, for this next dance
Move to the dance floor
Take your partner by the hand
And repeat these moves after me"

Alright

(You've got to)
Lock it, and load it, and aim for the heart
You've got to spin it, and flip it, rewind to the start
You've got to use it, or lose it, or give it away
You've got to plug it and play it, yeah
You've got to match it, and scratch it, and spin it around
You've got to mash it, and trash it, and torture the sound
You've got to loop and destroy it, and take it to town
Tell me what do you think about that?
(You've got to)
Race it, and chase it, all over the town
You've got to fly it, and crash it, right into the ground
You've got to rip it, and burn it, and pump up the sound
You've got pod it and blog it, yeah
(You've got to)
Pull it, and push it, and jump up and shout
You've got to work it, and jerk it, and slide it on out
Insert it, remove it, and wave it about
Tell me what do you think about that?

You've got to do whatever you want boy
You've got to do whatever you please
You've got to do whatever I tell you
You've got to do whatever I say to me
