I saw you sitting there so cool
Like you just come home from school
Looking such a pretty sight
Like a stick of dynamite
Sitting on a coffee bar stool

You're a gasser that's a fact and I never can relax until I've made you

I feel such a crazy clown
You're the biggest thing in town
Come on honey isn't fair
Never getting anywhere
How do I melt you down

You're a gasser that's a fact and I never can relax until I've made you

I'm not giving up the chase
I don't want to lose this case
Every time I make a play
Baby you just run away
I never make first basev

You're a gasser that's a fact and I never can relax until I've made you
