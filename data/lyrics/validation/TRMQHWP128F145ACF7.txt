I hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be

Baby, I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby, I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Living like there's no tomorrow
Currie says we're on the edge
He says, man you're really graphic
This band's a social wedge
We all got hearts made of metal
And our blood's hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal

So mister D.J., play just one for me
You know the one with the crushing
And the screams
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
