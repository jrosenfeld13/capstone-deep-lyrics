(C:) Hierarch of the Great White Brotherhood
Take me as I am as any brother would
This is ritual the man in singlet said
(L:) This is reactive the man in singlet said
(C:) A disaster for the people
Our nuclear show
Is run from above terminated below
Stop the violence I told the man in singlet
(L:) Heal with peace I told the man in singlet
(C:) He waned without trace in the transparent night
Balkanised my sleep to show off his might
Hierarch of the skies and the celestial sites
Hierarch of the truth and the supramental rites
To see is to know
To know is to control
This city is mine the city of my soul
Is it all as it may see or seem
Who directs me through the corridors of Dream
Who runs this planet where students are slain
Who is the head of this Academy of Pain
To the man in singlet, forward my command!
Bring me the answer I desire and demand!
(L:) The Chief is a good man but noone knows his face
Head of the realm of the golden race
(C:) The Chief is a good man but noone knows his face
Head of the realm of the golden race
How can I know that your invisible order
Isn't the idea of some second-rate marauder
That the inmost government just execute a plan
Konceived and kontrolled by some kommunist klan?
There is no coincidence and if there is
That is no coincidence neither is this
(L:) That the inmost government just execute a plan
Konceived and kontrolled by some kommunist klan
(C:) He waned without trace in the transparent night
Balkanised my sleep to show off his might
Hierarchs of skies and celestial sites
Hierarchs of truth and supramental rites
To see is to know
To know is to control
This city is mine
The city of my soul
Is it all as it may see or seem
Who directs me through the corridors of Dream
Hierarch of the skies and the celestial sites
Hierarch of the truth and the supramental rites
Hierarch of the Great White Brotherhood
(L:) Take me as I am as any brother would
(C:) Keep your system clean
And remain where you are
You may not hear the car
That comes from afar
