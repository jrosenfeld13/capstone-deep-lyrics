I would say it's enough
Burn your coffee drink it up
Whisper it or say it slow
Name the pet and let it go

It's time for a new run
Rip your tee and put it on
Break it up or lay low
Name the pet and let it go

I got your voice in the backround
I got a ticket and a song to sing
We left our conscience home backbound
'cause we don't need it where we are going

In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine

Let's end what we can't stop
Let it fall down, let it drop
This is what you want so
Name the pet and let it go

Watch your step or get caught
Decide what you like and not
You know what to ask for
Name the pet and let it go

I got your voice in the backround
I got a ticket and a song to sing
We left our conscience home backbound
'cause we don't need it where we are going

In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine

Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go

I would say it's enough
Burn your coffee drink it up
Whisper it or say it slow
Name the pet and let it go

It's time for a new run
Rip your tee and put it on
Break it up or lay low
Name the pet and let it go

In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
In the sunshine, in the sunshine

Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go
Name the Pet and let it go
