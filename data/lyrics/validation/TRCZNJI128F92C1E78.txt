Macy day parade
Saw it on a station
It is in the air
The floats are floatin' in it
Everything's all right

Yes everything is changed
Everything you thought of
But don't it look the same
When you bend down to it
Bend like giants filled with rum
You wanna see me Fee Fo Fum
You are traipsing through tonight
A garden of delight

Bring the family up
Bring your friends and neighbors
When they call, "Last call,"
You look so contagious
And I would catch it all

Neon signs of love
Exotic girls retire
Power's out tonight
It has blown a wire
So never mind
You never might
Till you cultivate an appetite
For the only open hand to bite
A garden of delight

Let your hair hang low
Let the air surround you
If I lick your wound tonight
Would you leave me or requite
Honey you are sure polite
A garden of delight
