You say that you're leaving
Well that comes as no surprise
Still, I kind of like this feeling
Of being left behind

This ain't nothing new to me
Well it's just like going home
It's kind of like those sunsets
That leave you feeling so stoned

Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell through this crack and I kind of lost my head
I stand transfixed before this streetlight
Watching the snow fall on this cold December night

Never thought this could happen
But somehow the feeling is gone
You got sick of the patterns
And I got lost in this song

Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell through this crack and I kind of lost my head
I stand transfixed before this streetlight
Watching the snow fall on this cold December night

Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell through this crack and I kind of lost my head
I stand transfixed before this streetlight
Watching the snow fall on this cold December night
And out in the middle of Lake Ontario

The same snow is falling
On the deep silent water
The great dark wonder
Into the waves of my heart
Into the waves of my heart
Of my heart
