In the garden of creation stands a skeletal tree
Hanging from it's branches afterbirth of Adam and Eve
Blossomed in mutation rotted through centuries
Tortured minds of heinous crimes plague God's family

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left - on the tree of life and death

Slug like dead existence, our fetid hunger breeds
Master of future decay - sowed his deadly seed
Root of evil ate away our fruits of destiny
Thorns of human nature stabbed hearts of the free

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left - on the tree of life and death

Ogau, Mulangam Kalumba
Kinta, Oloron, Makaru

Original sin

In the garden of existence
Hanging from temptation's tree
There's a carnival of mutations
Growing from man fated seed

Lezn, Marasa, Chiata
Nxambi, Osawa, Zanabary

God's offspring ate the apple creating lust, envy
Sucking, puking leaches, a catastrophe of greed
Garden of temptation, lured by serpent's creed
Moral desolation, man eternally diseased

Procreation from decay and sand
Transmutation pains this fated land
Lifeless earth, all love bereft
No life left - on the tree of life and death
