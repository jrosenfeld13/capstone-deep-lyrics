Uh girl, I love you I love you
Place no one above you
Can't you see that you're the one for me
And I, don't think that I want to
Fill this life without you
You're the best love I've ever known
And it's all my own

She gives me love
Like the warm sunshine
Hanging over my shoulder
And she makes me smile
Everytime I'm looking in her face
And everytime she leaves my world's
Just a little bit colder
So baby with all that you've given to me
I'm making sure you're happy

Uh girl, can't wait until tonight
Cos pleasure is delight
With your warm body
By the fire place
Oh girl, want you to depend on
My love and my strong arms
Cos you know they feel so good
And natural
She gives me love...

She gives me love
Like the warm sunshine
Hanging over my shoulders
And she makes me smile
Everytime I'm looking in her face
And everytime she leaves my world's
Just a little bit colder
So baby with all that you've given to me
I'm making sure you're happy

I got a friend on you
I can depend
She lifts my heart
Whenever I need
I think I'll do almost anything
I believe you would accept my ring
Much more than a feeling
Girl you're my life

She gives me love
Like the warm sunshine
Hanging over my shoulders
And she makes me smile
Everytime I'm looking in her face
And everytime she leaves my world's
Just a little bit colder
So baby with all that you've given to me
I'm making sure you're happy
