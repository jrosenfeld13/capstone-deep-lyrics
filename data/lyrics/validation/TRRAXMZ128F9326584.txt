Flames are gettin' hotter
Do you wanna come and see
All the people in the kitchen with me?

Such a, popular place to be
In the kitchen, in the kitchen
Never know who you meet
In the kitchen, in the kitchen
Everyone wants to be
In the kitchen, in the kitchen
'long with the Fat Freddies
In the kitchen, in the kitchen, whoa

Come (?), don't be blazed, displace
He's cookin' in the kitchen and we're eatin' for days
The boys come fishin' just from off of the bay
Doin' it for the love because the music pays
So, pass the bottle and bring out the craze
We got it cookin' in so many ways, yes
When we're at home or when you're away
Still rockin' rocks when my hair turns grey
So maybe moments ago, right after the show
Back to the pad you go, so just to follow your nose
And tell the girls and their bros, with those in the know
The only place to go, is to stick by the kitchen sink
On the third floor, that's where you get it
Everybody's in the house, now don't sweat it
You know where everybody is, the place to be
Cookin' red-hot with the Fat Freddies, come on now

Yeah
Yeah
