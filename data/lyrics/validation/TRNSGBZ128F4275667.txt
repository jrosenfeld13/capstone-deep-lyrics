[Verse 1]
Now mind and body and soul make for
A true soul brother that's able to make more
Rhymes than the others that claim to be MCs
But they all sound the same to me
They're lacking and licking words
And speaking blurs, slurs and it earths my nerves
I've had it (had it)
I can't take no more of the madness (madness)
I can't wait no more for the dumb shit yo, you gotta come with some lyric
But not that garbage 'cause I don't wanna hear it
Rhythm is a trait and an element. relevant
To giving your rhymes some way and development
But if you don't have it that can pose as a problem
'Cause that's what it takes to get the job done
So take notes if I cope the rhymes I wrote
And with the flex of my throat
I'm givin' 'em rhythm

[Chorus]
The rhythm, the rhythm, yes
The rhythm, the rhythm, yes
The rhythm, the rhythm, yes
The rhythm

[Verse 2]
I've got too much soul for one man to hold
And much to much rhythm, so I'm givin' it up
One time for your mind and I'm livin' it up
'Cause I'm rich in rhyme
So listen with an open ear
When's the last time you heard a rhyme this dope and clear
And understood and that good that it makes you wonder:
Would it be wise to try to get next to a giant
But you can't if you rhyme small time
'Cause like a record day in the summer I'm at an all-time high
And I try to continue going up so grow up
And step to me when you think you know enough
That you can even wish you can fit in my shoes
'Cause like B. B. King I'm giving rappers the blues
But I don't say so I choose to MC
And make them see how good a rapper can be
Or how smooth one can flow, fast or slow
How hype is the show, how high can I go?
Yo, the sky's the limit, I don't need a chemic
Stick to straight lyrics but then again at the drum beat
The funky rhymin' it makes it them comply
People know it's mine and they get excited
'Cause they know what's coming
They know I'm humming a rhyme to a drum and
I'm givin' 'em

[Bridge]
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm (Where's the fucking rhythm?)
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm (Where's the fucking rhythm?)

[Verse 3]
I speak with technique that's why I stand out
(?) and the rhyme's well planned out
I can't come (?)
Off the streets, I don't rhyme off-beat
But it seem like I'm linked on a chain and I gain
And I build 'cause I'm filled with rhymes in my brain
And my main concern is steady improvement
Crowd movement is easy to do when
You got rhythm it comes automatic
And if you wanna get it you will meet 'cause I have it
And since I know you need it, I won't flaunt it
I'm the type of brother that I'll put you up on it
So peep this, check it, I couldn't keep this record a secret
Nah I wouldn't do that 'cause that ain't how I'm livin'
But it's true that rhythm is what I'm givin'
With no hoes bored and it's owed to some why
Good rappers these days are hard to come by
Some try, but they can't cut it
'Cause they don't have what it takes or what makes
Rhythm come alive so much strive to do it
But you gotta be live to do it, I been through it
Rhyme after rhyme, time after time and time again
So no more inks in my pen (pen, pen, pen)
Huh! But that ain't the end
I pull out the fresh hit and get back in the flow
Keep adding to the rhymes and watching 'em grow
So keep up, if you slow, you blow those who slept I left
But Def Jef kept the others in steps with rhythm

[Chorus]
The rhythm, the rhythm, I be givin' 'em rhythm (yes!)
The rhythm, the rhythm, rhythm! (yes!)
The rhythm, the rhythm, I be givin' 'em (yes!)
The rhythm, the rhythm
