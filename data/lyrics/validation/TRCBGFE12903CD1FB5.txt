Raw power, more power, foot to the floor power here we go, here we go
Raw power, your power, out on the floor power
Drum power, bass power, right in your face power, rip it up
Raw power, full power, out on the floor power, here we go, here we go

Like a bullet from the gun, you're on the run
We got it if you want some, want some
We'll squeeze it to the last drop, from the bottom
To the very tip top, hip hop, don't stop, go!
Go, go, go, go!

Raw power, more power, foot to the floor power
Raw power, full power, out on the floor power, here we go, here we go

We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all

Rip it up come on, come on!

Slam dunking state of mind, every time
Throwing you a life-line, life-line
We'll leave the group shell-shocked from the bottom
To the very tip top, hip hop don't stop, go!
G-g-g-g-g-go, g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go, g-g-g-g-g-go!

Raw power, more power, foot to the floor power here we go, here we go
Drum power, bass power, right in your face power rip it up, trip it up
Raw power, your power, out on the raw power here we go, here we go

We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all
We got to give it all or nothing at all

To the next side giving it the jazz rinse

Hey, hey, hey slam dunking state of mind
Hey, hey, hey every time
Hey, hey, hey ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four four forty
