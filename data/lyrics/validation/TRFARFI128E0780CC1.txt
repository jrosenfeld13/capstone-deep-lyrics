[Verse 1]
Walk away to save your face
You never were a genius
Walk away to save your face
You let it come between us
Walk away to save your face
You never were a genius
Walk away to save your face
You never were, you never were

[Chorus]
Yes it's just the second night
But I would break back sights for you
Yes I know you're the jealous type
'Cause I'm cursed with second sight so

[Verse 2]
Walk away to save your face
You never were an actor
Walk away to save your face
Here comes the morning after
Walk away to save your face
You never were an actor
Walk away to save your face
You never were, you never were

[Chorus]

Third verse same as the first

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

Walk away [x8]
(You never were...)
