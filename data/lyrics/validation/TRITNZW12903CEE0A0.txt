There is a war inside your head
You're losing the battle against yourself
So awake the unholy spirit of your soul
Destroy your inner fears and go...

My hands of doom, will lead the way

A fistful of hate is not enough
Your vicious pain is all you've got

My hands of doom, will lead the way
My hands of doom, will take you to the grave

My hands of doom will take you there

Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death to end your misery
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death...

My hands of doom, will lead the way

I am the demon inside you, who won't come out
I am your unknown conscious, tearing you apart

My hands of doom, will lead the way
My hands of doom, will take you to the grave

My hands of doom will take you there

Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death to end your misery
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death...

Your soul possessed by me
I rule your mind
You're trapped inside yourself
My hands of doom will lead the way
