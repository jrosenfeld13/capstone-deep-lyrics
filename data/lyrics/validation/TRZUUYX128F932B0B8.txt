If you see me in some corner looking like all hope is gone
If you see me sit for hours and you wonder what is wrong
Well, it hurts to talk about it but my world just fell apart
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

Did you see the teardrops fallin' and the tremble in my hands?
Then you'll know that there's a story and nobody understands
It's a sad and lonely story but I'll try to make it short
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

Should you wonder how I got this way then listen, listen good?
He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
So I'm tryin' to forget him, lookin' for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

You may wonder how I got this way then listen, listen good
He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
So I'm tryin' to forget him, lookin' for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart
