Crooked rivers
Slowly flowing downward
Syntax its synergy
A spell that we are under
The trees and the leaves and the creek is what you seek
Shadow of your soul
Conquer the master mold
Underground streams of water
That work into the fold
A power on its own working to make its place
It's raw energy
Which seeks out any entity
Travel to the core
And overrides it totally
Fused in liquid lead with no crosses for the dead
The possessed
Ghasty sermons awaken the dead
Misery and violins are all that's in the end
Paint yourself the picture so it will make its place
