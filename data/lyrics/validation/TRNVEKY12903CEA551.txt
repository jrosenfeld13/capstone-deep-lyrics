All the sailors
With their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
Singin' songs
For pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars
At the door

You can really
Learn a lot that way
It will change you
In the middle of the day
Though your confidence
May be shattered
It doesn't matter

All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets
For the great unveiling
At the big parade

You can really
Learn a lot that way
It will change you
In the middle of the day
Though your confidence
May be shattered
It doesn't matter

All the bush league batters
Are left to die
On the diamond
In the stands
The home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
