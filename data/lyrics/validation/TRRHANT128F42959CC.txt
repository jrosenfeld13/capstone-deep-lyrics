Every day
They're waiting
Distant words
Postcards
For me

This is
Redirected mail
Redirected mail
Redirected mail

A valentine
A birthday
Last words of love
From me

This is
Redirected mail (I'm sorry)
Redirected mail (I left you)
Redirected mail (I'm sorry)
Redirected

I can't burden(?) them
Pains me
Seeing them
Sends me
Back to them
Turns me
Hard
And then

This is
Redirected mail (I'm sorry)
Redirected mail (I left you)
Redirected mail (I'm sorry)
Redirected mail

And every day
You're waiting
Every day
Reminders
This changed

I can't open you
Pains me
Knowing you
Brings me
Back to you
Keeps me
Loving you

I'm sorry
I left you
I'm sorry
I left you
I'm sorry
I left you
I'm sorry
I left you
I'm sorry
I left you
I'm sorry
I left you
