And we sing (out of tune)
Come on!
There's so many of you, so many people I see
So many of you that I'd like to meet
There's so many things we could do
If you only knew

Jump with you, sleep with you, cheat on our soulmates and find
That some people care and some they don't mind
It don't matter we do what we do
As we break on through

And we sing
Out of tune
We are on the cruise (the cruise)

Optimistic right now, maybe I am
I know how so many people hate that
They'd rather see you lose
And drag you in the hole they're into

Jump with you, laugh with you, babble while they criticize
Let them say what they say, no I really don't mind
Just let them do what they do
As we break on through

And we sing
Out of tune
We are on the cruise (the cruise)

Sleep with you
Deceive with you
Laugh with you
Break on through to the cruise

Yeah
And we sing
Out of tune
We are on the cruise (the cruise) (yeah)

There's so many of you, so many people I see
So many of you that I'd like to meet
So many things we could do on the cruise

We're on the cruise
We're on the cruise
We're on the cruise, we're on the cruise
We're on the cruise
(but mostly keep it alive)
