As I make my move to the floor
There comes a feeling that
I've never felt before
I am no longer your prey, I'm the predator

With every move that I make
I keep my hunting eyes on the game
And when my target is finally found
Now it's time to play

Only one condition before I move
It's absolute submission no safety fuse
I won't need your permission I'll break the rules
So you'd better keep your position
I'm in hot pursuit, my mission is you

No need to talk, when you're caught
Surrender your thoughts to withdraw
My orders are to satisfy
You won't have to beg for more

And you'll be wrapped around me
Trapped around me feeling that
That you can't live without me, die without me
Won't look back ever again
But remember there's
One thing you should know

Only one condition before I move
It's absolute submission no safety fuse
I won't need your permission I'll break the rules
So you'd better keep your position
I'm in hot pursuit, my mission is you

Gonna get a bit of that, where's the thunder at
Guess I can deliver that, I know
Gotta deliver that, why you turn your back
Got you in my track, don't look back

Gonna get a bit of that, where's the thunder at
Guess I can deliver that, I know
Gotta deliver that, why you turn your back
Got you in my track, don't look back

Only one condition before I move
It's absolute submission no safety fuse
I Won't need your permission I'll break the rules
So you'd better keep your position
I'm in hot pursuit, my mission is you

Only one condition before I move
It's absolute submission no safety fuse
I Won't need your permission I'll break the rules
So you'd better keep your position
I'm in hot pursuit, my mission is you
