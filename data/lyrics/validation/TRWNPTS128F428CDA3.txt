Dancing through the darkness
With a corpse for a partner
Trying hard to keep in step
Calliope entrancing
Spinning towards upheaval of the dead
Cracking cross the ceiling
Leaking plasm through the peelings
Evolve then dissolve
Wistful about your brothers
Yearning for the mother
And the calm.....before the storm
Chased by the past
Stalled in the present
Pissing on the future
Make no mistake
Within your haste
To stitch & suture
Without restraint
Or a guiding gaze
Rules are verboten
Marveling the waves
Crashing up the banks
& flooding to you
Dreams of peace elude
Torrents of pain deluge
Lacking the faith
To make another day
A chance for changes
Rolling in the waste
Of a stillborn taste
For levity
Proclivity reigns
Tightening the ropes
Of your behavior
Shooting at the moon
Burning up the spoon
Has made you weak
Dreams of peace elude
Torrents of pain deluge
Drawn into the whirlpool
Stream of consciousness cool
Ever widening circles
Envelop a drowning fool
Awaiting your deliverance
Begging for forgiveness
Looking for an answer
To mend a broken dream
Ever land of failure
Sparking up involvement
Shards of ramification
Grinding me
RAMPANT FOR REDEMPTION
REGULATE THE MADNESS
STRUGGLING TO GAIN BALANCE
REGULATE THE MADNESS
STRUGGLING TO GAIN BALANCE
Pragmatic vision
Momentous clarity
Sidestep derision
Aware of what must be
Debasement
Of hatred
And anger
