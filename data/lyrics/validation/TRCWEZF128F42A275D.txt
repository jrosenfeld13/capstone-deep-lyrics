I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a buddy that wakes up worrin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the markets strong
I spend my whole week wages
At the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio
But hey that's alright

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a cabin in the country and the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round

I got a woman that fills my heart so full
That it overflows
And how it gets any better than this
Brother I don't know

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
