Juice, juice, juice
Makes me loose, loose, loose
Juice, juice, juice
Makes me loose, loose, loose
Makes me feel so fine
When I'm with that gal of mine

I went to a party
It started kinda slow
But then it got real groovy
When the juice began to flow

Juice, juice, juice
Makes me loose, loose, loose
Makes me feel so fine
When I'm with that gal of mine

Along about 11
The juice was getting low
Then my baby shouted out
"Go out and get some more"

Oh, that juice, juice, juice
Makes me loose, loose, loose
Makes me feel so fine
When I'm with that gal of mine

She's not Yellow Rose of Texas
Not the belle of New Orleans
But when I'm with my baby
To me she's like a queen

Juice, juice, juice
Makes me loose, loose, loose
Makes me feel so fine
When I'm with that gal of mine
