Sometimes, looking back, I can't
Believe how many times I left her
I guess it's all part of the game
That we play

All is fair in love and war
But in this case they're quite the same thing
What's the difference if I go
Or if I stay?

I tried to tell her
I was not the only one to turn to
But she was indifferent to my pleas

And now she's going, going, gone
And I did nothing wrong
But she's going, going, gone

If I disappeared tonight
It would not change her mind about me
She's in love with someone who has changed
Since that day

She tried to show me
I was not the only one to turn to
But I won't get down on my knees

Until she's going, going, gone (she's going, gone)
And I did nothing wrong (she's going, gone)
But she's going, going, gone (she's going, gone)
And I did nothing wrong (she's going, gone)
But she's going, going, gone

Until she's going, going, going, going, going, going, gone (she's going, gone)
And I did nothing wrong (she's going, gone)
But she's going, going, gone (she's going, gone)
And I did nothing wrong (she's going, gone)
But she's going, going, gone

(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
(She's going, gone)
