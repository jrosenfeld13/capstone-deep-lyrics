And let me start from the beginning
I'm caught up in a love story so let me start singing
About that sweet and handsome piece of joy
I didn't know his name but he was living right next door to me

The first time he said hello was right in front of my door
And I couldn't really believe
The nicest things he said to me
I'm talkting about that thing called love like

Romeo & Juliet two lovebirds in the sun
But let me take you back to where this fairy tale begun
He started by singing me love songs and bringing me flowers in the evening
Because of that honey love
That sweet love
That tender kinda love

He brought me tulips and roses in the morning sun
Goodies and candies
He wooed me he moved me seduced me
With some soul reaching some soul reaching
The first time he said hello was right in front of my door
And I couldn't believe
The nicest things he said to me
I'm talkting about that thing called love like

Romeo & Juliet two lovebirds in the sun
But let me take you back to where this fairy tale begun
He started by singing me love songs and bringing me flowers in the evening
Because of that honey love that sweet love
Yhat tender kinda love

In harmony and with happiness that's the way this story ends
And I am sure that this love will last forever more
More...

He started by singing me love songs and bringing me flowers in the evening
Because of that honey love that sweet love

That tender kinda love
Sweet love tender love you see
Sweet love

Sweet love tender love you see
Sweet love

Sweet love tender love you see
Sweet love
