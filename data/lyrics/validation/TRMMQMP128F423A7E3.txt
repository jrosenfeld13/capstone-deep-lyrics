I never planned this
Where will it go
Hard to describe it
I'll never know
How did it happen?
And why is it so?

An unexpected undertow
Caught between the ebb and flow

It's pulling me under
Dragging me round
Like a force of nature baby
You turned my world upside down
Is it any wonder?
Without a doubt
Like a force of nature baby
I'm into deep with no way out

Now that I have this
I won't let it go
Just like an addict
I want even more
Can't break the habit
But why is it so?

An unexpected undertow
Caught between the ebb and flow
And you know

It's pulling me under
Dragging me round
Like a force of nature baby
You turned my world upside down
Is it any wonder?
Without a doubt
Like a force of nature baby
I'm into deep with no way out

It's a scary place to be
It's very hard to breath
And maybe you should save me
Maybe baby please

It's pulling me under
Dragging me round
Like a force of nature baby
You turned my world upside down
Is it any wonder?
Without a doubt
Like a force of nature baby
I'm into deep with no way out

It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under
It's pulling me under

It's pulling me under
Dragging me round
Like a force of nature baby
You turned my world upside down
Is it any wonder?
Without a doubt
Like a force of nature baby
I'm into deep with no way out

And there's no way out
