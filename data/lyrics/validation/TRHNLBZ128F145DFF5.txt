He was a lonely boy in a broken land
Where people were living and dying in the name of a higher man
And then one day into his hand the power of rock and roll

She was a hungry girl for a caring world
And the rules say don't take a step over there but she carries on
And drawn one day into the force by the power of rock and roll

Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, fighting for love, and singing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, telling you why, and showing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, gonna be joined by rock and roll

In a working band he became the man
But the law of the street said they could not meet in any circumstance
But she did not care, they began to share the power of rock and roll

Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, fighting for love, and singing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, telling you why, and showing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, gonna be joined by rock and roll

Well, they were learning, trouble they stayed ahead
And they were burning, burning up and seeing red
That the place they loved would fall apart
If you can't show feeling from the heart

And then fighting, know what they were fighting for
Can everybody give and take a little more?
Because it's all too easy to forget
That you can fight 'til there ain't no reason left
So everybody sing

Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, and singing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, and showing you
Woh, ohh, woh, ohh, and telling you
Woh, ohh, woh, ohh

He was a lonely man, she was a hungry girl
Living on different sides, they were praying for a guiding word
And then one day into their hands, the power of rock and roll

Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, singing you
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, showing you
Woh, ohh, woh, ohh, and telling you
Woh, ohh, woh, ohh
