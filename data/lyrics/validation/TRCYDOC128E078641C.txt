It's gonna blow right over your head
I'm gonna creep around in your bed
I'll be a hundred steps ahead
I know you think you've been mislead

I'll make it smash right into the wall
And take it to you, I could crawl
And I'll be better taste the last drop
There's a chance up taking last shoot

I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time (shake!)
I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time

It's gonna blow right over your head
I'm gonna creep around in your bed
I'll be a hundred steps ahead
I know you think you've been mislead

I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time (shake!)
I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time

I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time (shake!)
I'm gonna shake you out of my mind (shake!)
And you know it's right about time (shake!)
