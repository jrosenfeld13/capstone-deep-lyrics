If I could be with you one hour tonight
And I was free to do the things I might
I want you to know I wouldn't go
Until I told you baby that I love you so

If I could be with you I'd love you long
Just to be with you I'd love you all night long
I'm telling you true that you'd never be blue
If I could be with you for one hour
If I could be with you

Now if I could be with you one hour tonight
And I was free to do the things I might
Dear I want you to know I wouldn't go
Until I told you baby that I love you so

If I could be with you, well I'd love you long
To be with you I'd love you all night long
But I'm telling you true that you'd never be blue
If I could be with you for one hour
If I could be with you
