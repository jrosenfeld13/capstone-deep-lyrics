I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
There's a trick with a knife I'm learnin' to do
But everything I've got belongs to you!

I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist!
Hammer lock holds, I've mastered a few
But everything I've got belongs to you!

Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike!
Me for you, you for me
I'll give youy plenty of nothin'!

I'm not yours for better, but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witch's curse!
I've a terrible tongue and a temper for two
But everything I've got belongs to you!

Then at night we'll sleep and sleep
Sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep
And sleep and sleep
I'll give you plenty of nothin'!

I'm not yours for better, but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witch's curse!
I've a terrible tongue and a temper for two
But everything I've got
Oooh-ooh it's not a lot!
But everything I've got belongs to you!
