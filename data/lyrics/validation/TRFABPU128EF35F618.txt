Oh what a splendid story
But I've heard it before
To me it's a mystery
That's somehow still, well je t'adore
But really
I know the score
You've heard it before
You say that you're sanctuary

And you are
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
But you are

Taste extraordinary
On the tip of your tongue
There are things that may testify
That you're not unkind and that I am one
But feel
You've heard it before
Ten times or more
You say that you're sanctuary

And you are
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
But you are

Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest

Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest
Not quite like all the rest

But you are
Not quite like all the rest
But you are
Not quite like all the rest
But you are
Not quite like all the rest
But you are....
