Well it's a pretty bad place outside this door
I could go out there but I don't see what for
And I'm happy living here in the dark
On the edge of my mind
And it's nobody else's business
Now it's just me myself I and the secrets that live within the walls
Of the mansions of los feliz

Well the city's on fire you can smell the flesh
And the screams like dogs in the wilderness
And where all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Like it's everyone else's business
And at best they'll find the secrets that live within the walls
Of the mansions of los feliz

Well he's gone out again and left you all alone
Come on over I'm always home
And where do the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Well I do mean to make it my business
And it's just me myself and the secrets that live within the walls
Of the mansions of los feliz
