Repentance knocks
At the door
He smiles with his
Rotten black smile

"Hurry up, no time to waste"
"All that you miss is there"

Finally we arrive
In the mansion of guilt
"You are already late"
He says with a grin

Guide me
To the field of solitude

"They are all alone"
When I walk behind the rows
They are watching
I hide

I didn't want this
The insanity, the burden
My shoulders weren't strong enough
Oh God, Don't lay this upon me

They are all alone
I stand behind the rows
Then I wake up
To the sound of..

A distant echo
Ringing in my ear
The dream that went stale
Tear through the canvas of all these years
Through the painting of my mourning

Suddenly
The aisles are getting narrower
Crushing me
Pushing me away
Towards the altar of sleep
Towards the despair

I rise, I walk
Step by step
Closer to the mirror of anguish
Too scared to look
Too guilty to turn away

I stare the tree
Beside me
Lay down the words
That were meant to be
Prepare myself
I slip away

This is the final song as a reminder
Of a distinguished light
The final hymn for a house
That was burned down all too soon

Goodbye
