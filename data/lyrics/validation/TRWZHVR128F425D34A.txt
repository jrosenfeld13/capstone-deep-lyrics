Woke up this morning, went to the window, saw a rainy day
Feeling the pressure from all of the things I gotta face today
All of my days are totally crazy, can't do nothing right
It's an ordinary day
Every minute feels like an hour slowly creeping by
All of this stress but I do my best to take it all in stride
I need to decide, need to unwind, all these things are on my mind
It's an ordinary day
Things are crazy but it's alright
You make me feel alive again
When it rains you are the sunshine
That lights me up from deep within
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure
You've given me the pleasure of an ordinary day, an ordinary day
Pounding the pavement, another engagement
I'm gonna make it there on time
Hitting the side walk, hearing the small talk from people passing by
Wondering why, gotta rewind, think I gotta clear my mind
It's an ordinary day
What are the chances? I've locked glances with a passer by
Oh, a stranger must be an angel 'cause he smiled
I wonder if he knows anything I know that there is life
In an ordinary day
Things are crazy but it's alright
You make me feel alive again
When it rains you are the sunshine
That lights me up from deep within
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure
You've given me the pleasure of an ordinary day
Things are crazy, you make me feel alive
You are my sunshine
Things are crazy but it's alright
You make me feel alive again
When it rains you are the sunshine
That lights me up
An ordinary day
Ordinary day
