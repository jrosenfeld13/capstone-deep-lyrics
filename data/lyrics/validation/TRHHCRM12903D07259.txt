Run like the wind as you feel me close in
Hear my laughter as I grow near
You'll pay the price of your crimes with your life
As I unleash my vengeance on you

For I am the slayer of every betrayer
Whose victims beg for my lance
And you'll beg and plead as I just let you bleed
Ask no mercy for I've none to spare

Bow as I pass or be felled by my lance
If my shadow falls upon you
Feel my caress of metal through your breast
I'll be damned if I fall on to you
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE

Who has the right to defeat royal might
I've no fear I'll slay them all
Bring on the hordes of wicked warlords
Send their souls screaming to hell
Become an ally in my war to defy
Draw your sword, join the fight
Now is your chance to destroy their advance
To live free or die like a man
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
