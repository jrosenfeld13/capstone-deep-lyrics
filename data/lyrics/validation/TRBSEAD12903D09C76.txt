[Verse 1]

[Chorus 1]
And if I fall and crash and burn
At least we both know that I tried
And as I crawl those lessons learned
Yeah they remind me I survived
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]

And if I fall and crash and burn
At least we both know that I tried
And as I crawl those lessons learned
Yeah they remind me I survived
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And I've been hurt and I've been scarred
At least I know that I'm alive
And If I fall and crash and burn
At least we both know that I tried

Don't leave me down here all by myself

[Chorus 1]
And if I fall and crash and burn
At least we both know that I tried
And as I crawl those lessons learned
Yeah they remind me I survived
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And I've been hurt and I've been scarred
At least I know that I'm alive
And If I fall and crash and burn
At least we both know that I tried
