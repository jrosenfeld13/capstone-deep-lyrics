Dark as night, cold and lonely
Rides the horse that's known as only Thunder Road

Icy fingers hold the reins
While hoofs come poundin' so insanely on and on

Eyes that dance like burnin' embers
All the county still remembers who you are
Did she love you like they say?
And did she really run away ond leave you here?

Ride the wind

Tonight you'll find her there
No more racin'
With the damp night air

Down the road to Whitman's Crossing
Underneath the Widow's blossoms soft and green
Covered by the crimson shawl
Hidden by the leaves that fall down to the ground
Midnight comes and midnight goes
Inbetween the moonlight shadows veiled in tears
