Gravity is pulling you in
Cause the earth it won't stop spinning
It's no surprise
You found me again
After all it was the best thing that we ever had

Now sugar, I can see you honey
Ooouuuu lets not pretend that it's here babe
The world that we know disappeared long ago
Cause we just couldn't carry the weight

I know you all, want someone to care
To find the words when you can not find them yourself
The things you lost, you'll never get back
It's too late, you're just gonna drag out the past

Now sugar, can't you see oh honey
Ooouuuu lets not pretend that it's here babe
The world that we know disappeared long ago
Cause we just couldn't carry the weight

This time what are you searching for
The better days you thought you had before
So what if you don't see it anymore
Can you hear what I sayy-

Oh yes now sugar, I can see you honey
Ohh now baby
Ooouuuu lets not pretend that it's here babe
The world that we know disappeared long ago
Cause we just couldn't carry

Ooouuuu lets not pretend that it's here babe
The world that we know disappeared long ago
Cause we just couldn't carry the weight
Just couldn't carry the weight
Just couldn't carry ohh
Just couldn't carry ahh
Just couldn't carry ooouuuu
