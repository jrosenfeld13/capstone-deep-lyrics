A howling wing blew through your mouth
As your eyes caught fire
You speak to me of ancient times
But I can't hear you
I can't hear you
A hidden door that never closes
Keeps the angels at bay
Whispers in your sleeping hours
That never lie or fade away

And one last breath before I fade
To dust and simply melt away

A mirror cracked and faded
Reflections made of stone
And light that shines within your eyes
Dissolve in shadows once again

So picture here a burning room
Where lovers die in cold embrace
The creeping hands of time decay
Blood and kisses turn to hate

And one last breath before I fade
To dust and simply melt away

And one last breath before I fade
To dust and simply melt away

Stranger things hide in human guise
Than reside in the valleys of hell
