Raise
Raise me from the dead
Put away my shame
Erase the demons in my head
Whispering her name

Ooh like a siren song
Here she comes

Its the sound of
It's the sound of
Quiet German girls

Grace
Not waste another year
Before the lights grow old
I'll taste
And love wont disappear
How sweet the sound

Its the sound of
Its the sound of
Quiet German girls
Its the sound of
Its the sound of
Quiet German girls

Shes a coast girl
A holy ghost girl
A quiet German girl
