If I could say your name it wouldn't come to this
And if I know your mine then it'll be alright
But if I stay the night then I'll never fix what I want to
I wanna know if there's a way that you could take my hand with yours
Before I slip and fall, and fall again

We're not afraid of where we're going
We're just afraid of where we've been

If I could say your name it wouldn't come to this
And if the timing's right we could be just fine
But like I said before,I know I'll never fix what I want to
If you could find a way to wait then I could stall
And calm back down before I slip and fall, and fall again

We're no afraid of where we're going
We're just afraid of where we've been

If you could see what I've seen
You wouldn't try to mess with me
And though we've been here before
This time we'll realign
I'll say your name and things will be just fine
If I could say your name
If I could say your name, if I could say your name
If I could fall asleep without you
We're not afraid, we're not afraid
