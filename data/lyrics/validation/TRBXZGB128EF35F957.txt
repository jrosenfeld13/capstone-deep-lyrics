[Verse 1]
Goodbye...
Flower of England
The pain never fades away after all this time
World war
And revolution
The heart in the heart of England will never die

[Chorus]
Bringing home the ashes
Is more than I can bear

[Verse 2]
Goodbye
King of sorrow
The curse of a thousand years beneath the gloves
Worn down and hardly breathing
The heart in the heart of England will never die

[Chorus 2]
Bringing home the ashes
Is more than I can bear
When winter lightning flashes
You'll find me lonely there

Bringing home the ashes
Is more than I can bear
When winter lightning flashes
You'll find me lonely there
