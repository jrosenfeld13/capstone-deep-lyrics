One grain of sand
One grain of sand in all the world
One grain of sand
One little boy, one little girl

One grain of sand
One little star up in the sky
One grain of sand
One little you, one little I

One grain of sand
One drop of water in the sea
One grain of sand
One little you, one little me

One grain of sand
One leaf of grass--on a windy plain
One grain of sand
We come and go again and again, again

I love you so
I love you so, I love you so
I love you so
More than you will ever, ever, ever, ever, ever know

One grain of sand
One little snowflake lost in the swirling storm
One grain of sand
I'll hold you alone and keep you warm

One grain of sand
One grain of sand on an endless shore
One grain of sand
One little life, who'd ask for more

One grain of sand
One grain of sand, one grain of sand
One grain of sand
One grain of sand, one grain of sand

One grain of sand
One little star up in the blue
One grain of sand
One little me, one little you
