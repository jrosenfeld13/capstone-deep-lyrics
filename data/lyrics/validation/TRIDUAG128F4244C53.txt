You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

Said the monkey to the lion on a bright summer day
"Say man, there's a big, bad cat living down the way
You know he talks about your folks in a heck of a way
And he says a whole lot of things that I'm sorta afraid to say"

Well, the lion jumps salty, all full of rage
Like a Harlem cat that's left in his cage
He meets the elephant up under a great big tree
And he says, "Now look here big boy, it's either you or me"

They fought all night and they fought all day
Man, I really don't know how, but the lion, he got away
He come back to the jungle more dead than alive
And that's when the monkey started to signify

(You call yourself the jungle king)
(You call yourself the jungle king)
(You call yourself the jungle king)
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

[Instrumental Break]

You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

Well, he worked up his temper when he was jumping up and down
And his foot missed the limb and his head hit the ground
Like a bolt of lightning and a streak of heat
The lion was on the poor monkey with all four feet

The monkey looks up from the corner of his eyes
And he says, "Now Mr. Lion, I apologize"
The monkey on his back, now he's slick, he studies up a scheme
He's trying to trick the ol' jungle king

He said "Now bare with me Mr. Lion, like a good lion should
Please don't tear me up and throw me all over the woods!"
Well, the lion jumps up, and he squares off to fight
Oh, but the monkey fooled him, he was completely out of sight

(You call yourself the jungle king)
(You call yourself the jungle king)
(You call yourself the jungle king)
I found out you ain't a doggone thing
