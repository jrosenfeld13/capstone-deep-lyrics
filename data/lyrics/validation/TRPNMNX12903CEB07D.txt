Yeah I seen you there
Looking all pretty when you brush your hair
Yeah I like it when you smile

Won't you stay with me just for a little while?

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high?
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go

Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa

Sittin' here in beneath the star
Makes me wanna take them wings to my arms
She's got this way
She's got this way
Of wrapping her little heart around mine

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high?
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go

Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high?
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go

Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa
