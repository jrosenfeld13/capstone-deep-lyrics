I've been alone for so many years
You think I disappeared
From an empty space
There's silence beside me
Unbearable - because of you
You're so close - but where are you?
My heart will be dying
My dreams will be dead

There's silence beside me
I'm feeling so lonely
My heart is dying - for you
There's silence beside me
I'm waiting - where are you
My dream is dying - just like me
Without you

I lie awake for hours - like I said I would
But I'm hurt - alone once again
You broke your promise time and time again
Seems you're invisible
Do you even exist
My heart will be dying
My dreams will be dead

There's silence beside me
I'm feeling so lonely
My heart is dying - for you
There's silence beside me
I'm waiting - where are you
My dream is dying - just like me
Without you

My destiny
It's not that our love should be

There's silence beside me
I'm feeling so lonely
My heart is dying - for you...
