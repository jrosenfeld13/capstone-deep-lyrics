I saw her from the back standing in that line
She didn't turn around and I never saw her face
She had the sweetest voice I ever heard in my life
I never won't ever forget that sound
I should get a grip on myself
I probably will never see her again
That's the way things go

Ahahahah
Uohohohoh
Uohohohoh, that's the way things go

I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl
I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

I keep on going back, I'm standing in that line
And they all turn around, but I never see her face
She has the sweetest voice, I ever heard in my life
I know I won't ever forget that sound
I've lost the grip on myself I probably will never meet her
But then that's the way things go

Ahahahah
Uohohohoh
Uohohohoh, that's the way things go

I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl
I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

About that girl
About that girl
Yeah yeah

I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

I've lost my mind
I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl

I don't know how I can meet her
But my head is full of thoughts about that girl
