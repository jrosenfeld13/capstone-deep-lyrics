Well I'm goin' to New Orleans
I wanna see the Mardi Gras
Yes I'm goin' to New Orleans
I wanna see the Mardi Gras

When I see the Mardi Gras
I wanna know what's carnival for

Goin' down to New Orleans
I've got my ticket in my hands
Goin' down to New Orleans
I've got my ticket in my hands

When I get to New Orleans
I wanna see the Zulu King

Way down in New Orleans
Down on Rampart and Dumaine
Yes down in New Orleans
On Rampart a-nd Dumaine

Gonna make it my standin' place
Until I see the Zulu Queen
