[Taps Plays...]
"Good night..."

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's over now, but I can breathe somehow
When it's all worn out, I'd rather go without

[Chorus 1]
You know it's been on my mind
Could you stand right there
Look me straight in the eye and say
That it's over now

We pay our debt sometime

[Verse 2]
Well it's over now, yet I can see somehow
When it's all gone wrong, it's hard to be so strong

[Chorus 1]
You know it's been on my mind
Could you stand right there
Look me straight in the eye and say
That it's over now

We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime

[Verse 3]
Guess it's over now, I seem alive somehow
When it's out of sight, just wait and do your time

[Chorus 2]
You know it's been on my mind
Could I stand right up
Look myself in the eye
And say that it's over now

We pay our debt sometime
Yeah we pay our debt sometime
