Today has been a special day
An anniversary, a request
That you play your piano
As the evening sun slowly sets

I never thought I'd get this old dear
Never had a reason to live so long
And the lord's been like my shadow
Even when I was wrong
No I never thought it would turn out this way

The birthday with apologies
For all the tears and regrets
And I've always saved your poetry
For these years when you forget

I never thought I'd get this old dear
Never had a reason to live so long
And the lords been like my shadow
Even when I was wrong
No I never thought it would turn out this way

So sing with me softly
As the day turns to night
And later I'll dream
Of paradise with you
I love you
And goodnight
