Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll will never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Get out of the blue and into the black
They give you this but you pay for that
And when you die, no you won't come back
Because your out of the blue and into the black

My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey, hey
