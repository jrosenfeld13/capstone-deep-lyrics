Reflect my heart, I saw an angel in a noose
But the barb wire, it was sort of loose
With a stillborn cherub in her arms and how she held
She wasn't cut, she wore a necklace of her bruise
The pearls of pain that she put to use
Bruise, bruise, bruise, bruise, bruise
With a stillborn cherub in her arms and how she held
The little thorn to keep her warned
With a stillborn cherub in her arms and how she held
Love is a nail
Always too late
When you're impaled
The pain of that
The rope of trust
Hangs you till more
And when it's still
Until you're dead
Until you're dead
Until you're dead
Until you're dead
Until you're dead
