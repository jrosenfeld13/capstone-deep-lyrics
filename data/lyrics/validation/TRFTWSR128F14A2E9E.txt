Never call when you're out late
I don't know when you're comin' home
Change your mind just like the weather
And I don't know if I'm ever gonna

Break this ball and chain
And to you our love is just a little game
Now there's a fine line between
Pleasure and pain
You love me like a ball and chain

When I called up information
Tryin' to pinpoint a location
When I find out unexpected
That your nunber's disconnected

Oh I got to break this ball and chain
And to you our love is just a little game
Now there's a fine line between
Pleasure and pain
You love me like a ball and chain

I spent all my money
On a big shiny car
I spent all my time
In the back of a bar

Drivin down the highway
But I never get far
Keepin up with you baby's
Like chasin a star

Never call when you're out late
I don't know when you're comin' home
Change your mind just like the weather
And I don't know if I'm ever gonna

Break this ball and chain
And to you our love is just a little game
Now there's a fine line between
Pleasure and pain
You love me like a ball and chain

There's a fine line between
Pleasure and pain
Love me like a ball and chain
There's a fine line between
Pleasure and pain
Love me like a ball and chain
