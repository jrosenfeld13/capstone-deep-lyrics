I can take your pictures off my wall
And tell myself that I don't care at all
I can make believe I'm better off without you
I can build a wall
I can fool myself
But that won't help at all

You see the problem is deep within my heart
And the memory is to blame
And I won't really be the same
As long as you're there

I tore up all your letters I had saved
As if that would make my loneliness go away
Then I spent the day picking up the little pieces
Just to read again
All about the way you loved me way back when

You see the problem is deep within my heart

And the memory is to blame
And I won't really be the same
As long as you're there

You see the problem is deep within my heart
And the memory is to blame
And I won't really be the same
As long as you're there

I'm light and gay with friends who come to call
I've learned to hold my tears that were meant to fall
Then late at night your face appears before me
Like a cannon ball
And I know that I've learned nothing after all

You see the problem is deep within my heart
And the memory is to blame
And I won't really be the same
As long as you're there
