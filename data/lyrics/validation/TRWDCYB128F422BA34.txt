I've been waiting on a train
She runs from stoplight to hydrant
I asked her where the fire was
And put it out
I've been waiting on a train
She runs on green rice and mint toothpicks
And her tracks go up my back
He was grabbing at thin air
Had his arms waving around
Crooked at the elbow reaching for a light
I've been waiting on a train
She don't pay attention to her watch
'cause she knows what she's got around her finger
I've been waiting on a train
She's gonna snowball this place
Bad luck and trouble are her only friends
He was still breathing in there
Trapped behind his eyes
Bet that he could hear me say goodbye
The atmosphere was dark and dry
In the room where he made his home
I wish i wasn't leaving already
Shut the door, shut the door
Get the phone, get the phone
