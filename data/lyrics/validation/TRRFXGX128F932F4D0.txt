You
You're one of a kind
Forever leaving behind
A little bit of your love
A little piece of your clear sky
Turning on the lights in my heart
And I
I was'nt aware
You came in on the wind
The way a beautiful dream comes back to you
And I'm sure
I've never felt this way before
Cos you to me
Are all
You're everything but tragic
Everything that's good inside me
You
You're everything I need
Dissolving like a dream
Do you see what i see
Changing all around
You tell me who I am
You tell me what i need
You look at me straight on
Looking at me in
Some kind of sunstruck way
That I can't quite explain
I'm gonna tell everybody
I'm loving my life
You give me all you have
Leaving a smile on my mouth
It's what it's all about
You know I really love love love you
Cos you to me
Are all
You're everything but tragic
Everything that's good inside me
You
You're all I ever need
Dissolving like a dream
Do you see what i see
Changing all around us
And i'm stepping out of me
Stepping into you
You give me love love love
Love love love
You give me love love love
I hold my breath I'm waiting waiting for your
Love love love........
Do you see what I see
Stepping in to you
