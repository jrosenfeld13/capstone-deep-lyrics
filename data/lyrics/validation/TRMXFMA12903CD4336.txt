Talk about your problems
I've got problems
Too many problems
Why bother going on
Crawl into a shell
Life's a living hell
I might as well get some weed and bong

Friday night what's going on
Call up friends and cruise around
Suck down some beer
Smoke some dope
Have some fun
Raise hell in another town
Where you know no one

Cops come, they end it all
Haul you up against the wall
Nightstick out, they start to maul
In that cell get one phone call
Call your friend
Tell him where you hid the stash
Tell him he's got to raise the cash
To get you out of jail real fast
There's no telling how long you're going to last

Before you go insane
The acid you took
Just hit your brain
