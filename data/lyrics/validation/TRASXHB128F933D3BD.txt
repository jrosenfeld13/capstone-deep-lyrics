(Dicky Barrett/Nate Albert)

They came to Boston on their vacation
They came, they saw, they annoyed me
They saw it all, what! Fanueil Hall! It's best if they just avoid me
Rented a car to see the sights they found the Hub confusing
Looked for the Swan Boats In Mattapan well, I find that real amusing
I was here before they came. I'll be here long after
Don't want to share, but it seems clear that I'm gonna have to
They came to Boston for an education live in the dorms, join a frat
Jam my bars and subway cars now, what the fuck is that?
Spend year one having fun and causing aggravation
Spending daddy's cash on a toga bash when the hell's graduation?
I was here before they came I'll be here long after
Don't want to swear, but it seems clear that I'm gonna have to aww fuck
I was here before they came I'll be here long after
Don't want to share, but it seems clear that I'm gonna have to
I was here before they came I'll be here long after
Don't want to share, but it seems clear that I'm gonna have to
They came to Boston(9x)
