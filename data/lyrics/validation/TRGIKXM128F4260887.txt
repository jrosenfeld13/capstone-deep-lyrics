Well I got myself a woman and I got myself a band on the other hand
Because I can't stand when folks take my happiness away
I sway like I was the wind blowing and I'm not glowing anymore
Sore is my mood, and mood is my emotion
Emotion is my food, so what's with my pollotion?
Or shall I say pollution?
Because me resolution for the new year is cheer
So let me endear to the simple little things that can get me hard
Like waking in the morning and spraying Right Guard in my underarm
Warm is the feeling when I can tell that I don't smell
Don't let shit prevail with the post intelligence control
What's the goal when I'm speaking on poetics from the soul?
The truth is that my happiness is rapping this in all of the splendor
For the feminine gender, I'll render rhymes in complexity
The crowd is standing next to me because they're enthralled by my lyrical
Ecstasy
Just call it love, man, it happens all the time
When I get drwn to the beat and my rhyme
Mine is yours, and the mic is our connection
Make that shit sweet with the p.i.c confection
Sort of like a drug without the bodily harm, make it warm with the funk
Lifelong
And sing a happy song
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Take me out
Out on the town
I want to be loved
All night long
Walking on the east side
I couldn't hail the cabbie ride
Had to use my feets
To walk these streets
So I'm heading towards avenue Z
But I couldn't cross the river E
So I made my way to Tommy Square Park
Sitting on the fence at the Dog Run Bark
That's where I said hey to Jungle Jim
Saw this girl I'm like why you with him
She said leave me alone you big scrub
You got the back and I got the rub
Running away she got into her ride
Leaving me alone on the happy Slide
Check out my face and see my grin is wide
I'm savoring the flavor from a private place
Butterfly tattoos and white panty lace
I'm spinning off the taste of the Caragay wine
My secret elixir to the U-N-G mind
Soul showing through the flowing
So everybody's knowing I'm the pinoy b-boy kind in time
Kept the bounce going on from here to Luzon
Counter acting negativity like a proton
PIC lasting long like Anna Bell Chong
Good for the body like Tai Chi Chuan
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
Happy song got it going on
