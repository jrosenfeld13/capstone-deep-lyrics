All you are is what you want
And all you ever want is fear
All you are is something far from what you thought was clear

If something you thought was something quite clear
The thought of the cost  in our own time is something to fear
Which idol to grip and to hold
You think it's a wise choice until all of your bullshit unfolds

If all that you say is blood in my way, life's blood
You'll obey
