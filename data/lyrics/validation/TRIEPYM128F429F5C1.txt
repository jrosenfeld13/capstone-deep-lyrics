If music be the food of love, then play on
Play on, play on
Play on, play on

If music be the food of love, then baby play on, play on
Let the heavens celebrate our love
And baby, play on, play on

To be or not to be, it doesn't matter much to me
(That's right)
Wherefore art thou my romeo, the only boy I want to know
He's mine (he's mine)

I guess I'm lucky, I lead a charmed life
I want you boy for the rest of it
I know baby that you want me too
We can make music the whole night through

And that's Shakespeare
To be or not to be

Romeo oh Romeo
Wherefore art thou my romeo
(He's the best)
Hold me tight and dance with me
And whisper words of poetry, yeah

You say that love will satisfy this heart of mine
Sweet words of love will penetrate me every time

I wear my heart upon my sleeve
I want you baby, don't ever leave
If love is blind, that's all Greek to me
'Cause we'll live a charmed life in perfect harmony, yeah

To be or not to be
To be or not to be
That's Willie the shake
Play on
To be or not to be
To be or not to be
Play on, play on

That is Shakespeare
To be or not to be....
