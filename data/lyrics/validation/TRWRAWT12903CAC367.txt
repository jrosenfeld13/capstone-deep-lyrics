[Verse 1]
My name is Gwen, uh, but they call me Blondie
I'm better known as the one and only
I'm five foot two, built so fine
36-26-36 dime
I'm better known as freaky 10
A Sequence freak with all the fans
When I clap my hands and I stomp my feet
I jam to the sound of the Sequence beat
Wave your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire
My main man Yogi Bear
I said I hit-ma-jazz, and I raz-ma-jazz
And I jam to the disco beat
And if you could move your body like you move your hands
Then I'm sure you can move your feet
Cause I'm supersonic, I'm a 3X tonic
When I'm not down, I'm up
When I get real hungry I run to the store
And get my Resees cup
I watch TV on my own
You gotta Yabba-Dabba-Doo with Fred Flintstone
I'm sweeter than candy, I'm sweeter than honey
That's why they call my Blondie
I'm super cool and I'm super fine
And I'm one of a kind to shock your mind
And you can ring my bell all through the night
Uh, you could rock my body till the early light
Uh, don't ring my bell, I'm sayin' please
If you cannot fulfill my needs
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But they call my name from coast to coast
From the coast of California to the shore of Maine
Everybody loves the way I play my game
Say I got more rhymes in the back of my mind
Than Benny D got lovers
I say I got style and I got class
I don't talk my stuff to fast
See, I'm cold as ice, I'm twice as nice
I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Blondie, hey that's me
I'm rapping in the key of R-A-P
I said bye-bye, baby, boogie, a boogie, baby
Boogie baby, boogie baby, goodbye
I said bye-bye, baby, boogie, a
Boogie, baby, boogie baby, boogie baby, goodbye
And you heard the raps of Blondie
And it was all the way live
I said Blondie, hey, that's me
I'm rapping in the key of R-A-P

Ring-ding-dong
Ring a ding-ding-ding-dong
Ring-ding-dong
Ring a ding-ding-ding-dong

[Verse 2]
They call me Cheryl and I'll tell you why
Cause I got such sexy bedroom eyes
And I pop 'em out and you look surprised
I got you and you're hypnotized
My love is strong if you can stand
To be within my sexy trance
But don't let this tell you about me
I'm a jealous lady and that you'll see
If I don't get the things that I mention
That's when I start crying for attention
(Attention) That's what I say
And things just always go my way
Well I talk a lot but I'm really shy
My loving ways just get me by
I write the baddest sounds around
I'm guaranteed to throw down
The only difference between you and
And that is that I'm sexy
I'm an angel possessed with some devilish eyes
With the curvy hips to make your nature rise

[Verse 3]
I said Angie B is what they say
I got chocolate hips and a Milky Way
And I feel like a millionaire in space
Flyin' on a go-cart with a silver lace
Everybody calls me never wrong
Cause I'm a best style freak with a funky song
Do you hear me talkin', do you hear me singin'
On the microphone, won't you sing along
(You go do it, you go do it, you go do it, do it, do it)
I got two great partners standin' by me
That's guaranteed to jam to the beat
One is Blondie and she's right on time
She calls herself Miss Super Fine
I said Cheryl the Pearl is the one with the eyes
She's guaranteed to hypnotize
Said Angie B, he, that's me
I can rock you so dangerously
(You go do it, you go do it, you go do it, do it, do it)
At a quarter to six you got in a fix
And you called on Angie B
And you look surprised as I arrive
To see me dressed to a tee
(You go do it, you go do it, you go do it, do it, do it)

Yodle-lay-de-hoo
Yodle-lay-de-hoo
Cha-cha-cha (Ha-ha-ha)
Yodle-lay-de-hoo
Yodle-lay-de-hoo
Cha-cha-cha (Ha-ha-ha)
