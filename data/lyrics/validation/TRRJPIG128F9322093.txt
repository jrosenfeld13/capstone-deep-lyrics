Sweet Marie I can hardly wait
There's gas in the tank tonight's our fate
Let us not part sore by the porches light
Lets go out together into the night
She said her friend Peter had a steady wage
A home for two, numbers on the page
Well I thought for a while and that's when she spoke
The words as they started I thought a joke ...she said...
Come see me when the crop comes in
When the water's high, you can afford to spend
I'm high on the cotton and my dress is fine
I'd spend it all - if you could be mine
I'm not the kid of woman that's bound to lose
So don't come around with your poor boy blues
Well she was sore from the moment she picked up
A plastic fork and a paper cup
But she laughed at the jokes and she sure could smile
Something cheap as love should last a while ...she said...
Does a diamond really talk that loud
Does just love not make you proud?
When you've got all you can use
Don't bore me with your rich girl blues
Well Sweet Marie I could hardly wait
Back when I thought you were my fate
A diamond told you to walk that aisle
Even though you could have been my style
Come see me when the crop comes in
When the water's high, you can afford to spend
I'm high on the cotton and my dress is fine
... I wouldn't spend it all - if you could be mine
