[Verse 1]
I can remember
I can remember a time of beginning to relate
To who you are
Who you really are
Never look back 'cause we've come so far
There's a place
I can never return
So I decide to let it burn
Far away
Is where I'd rather be
Than to see that look upon your face

[Bridge]
Our love is all around here
She goes away just to be near

[Chorus]
Caroline
Tell me why you wanna leave this way?
Caroline
Tell me where you gonna go this time?
'Cause all we are
Is all we are and now it's up to you

[Verse 2]
Caroline
We'll find a place that makes you feel apart
Well, it gets you high and makes you feel the possibility
And who you really are
Who you really are
Never look back
'Cause we've come so far
There's a place
I can never return and from here you'll start tonight

[Bridge]
Our love is all around here
She goes away just to be near

[Chorus]
Caroline
Tell me why you wanna leave this way?
Caroline
Tell me where you gonna go tonight?
'Cause all we are
Is all we are and there's no reason why
'Cause all we are
Is all we are
Don't let it go to waste
Don't you let it go to waste
Don't you ever go away
