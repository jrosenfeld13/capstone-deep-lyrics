Ran up ran down
Ran around and round
Ran over ran under from town to town
Got up got down
Got sick got well got over under
Got a self-serve hell

[Chorus:]
I'm stuck in a bag of glue
Say what who the fuck are you
Pushed in pushed out
Pushed a tired heart
Threw up threw down
Threw a thousand darts
Took mine, took yours
Took a thousand years
Took blue, took yellow
Took a perma-tear

[Chorus]
