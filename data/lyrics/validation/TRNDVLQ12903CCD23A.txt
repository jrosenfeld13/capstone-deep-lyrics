It's a little bit like sun when your smile is focused on me
With stars in your eyes
It reminds me of summers up north where the clear winds will blow
Through the mountains with snow

But it can all turn around as I know
With the words you say
Before you go
Nothing can change us from being ourselves
And I'm left here in town with nothing as help

It's raining in New York
And I know what it feels like
Cause I've walked 3rd Avenue
With tears in my eyes
It's raining in L. A
And I know what it feels like
Cause I see those tears
Come through when we try

Sometimes your words make me happy or angry or sad
It depends, how I feel
If I feel strong there's a chance that I laugh at your notes
That tells me you're gone

But it can all turn around as I know
With a change of weather, yes then I'll be low
Anything done and said on my part
Can keep us together or pull us apart

It's raining in New York
And I know what it feels like
Cause I've walked 3rd Avenue
With tears in my eyes
It's raining in L. A
And I know what it feels like
Cause I see those tears
Come through when we try

I know there is something between us, my love
It's stronger than what we can break
It'll keep us together forever, my love
It's like we have nothing to say

It's raining in New York
And I know what it feels like
Cause I've walked 3rd Avenue
With tears in my eyes
It's raining in L. A
And I know what it feels like
Cause I see those tears
Come through when we try
