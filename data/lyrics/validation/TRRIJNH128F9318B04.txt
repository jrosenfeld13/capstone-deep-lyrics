Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead
Somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd settle down and do just fine
But I still love rock 'n roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

I got my angel raising kids
I'm raising hell just like I did
I got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Some might be calling me a bum
'Cause I'm still out here having fun
Jesus loves me yes I know
I keep on rollin' with the flow

I got my angel raising kids
I'm raising hell just like I did
I got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't never growing old
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Keep on rollin' with the flow
