I've been looking for a safe place
Looking for a safe place half of my life
Some kind of wallet
Some kind of ...
Some kind of state of grace

In a safe place
A safe place

There have been times I've found that safe place
Pulled the covers back and climbed on in
Like steady breathing
Like Christmas Morning
Pulled the blankets to my neck and grinned

In a safe place
A safe place

So out of the dark and into the light
I'm running hard with all of my might

There have been times when I almost stopped believing
Seen the darkness was dogging my heels
But every time a light in the center said
Follow me ...

To a safe place

Cause there's not too many places in this world

But every time I find you in the middle
Saying welcome home honey I'm glad you're here

In a safe place

I've been looking for a safe place
Looking for a safe place half of my life
Some kind of wallet
Some kind of ...
Some kind of state of mind
