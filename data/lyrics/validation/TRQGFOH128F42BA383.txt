Comin to you from above
World

I got twenty three misdemeanors
I got APB's from Anchorage all the way down to cleveland
A million dollar reward
They want me alive or dead

Gonna put three in my head

Up against the wall
Snipers on the roof
Thought I was a gonner baby

Up against the wall
Snipers on the roof

Put the searchlights on me
A hundred hound dogs on my trail
And I'll skip the state like Jesse James
Tennessee law man on my tail

Of my Gatling gun
