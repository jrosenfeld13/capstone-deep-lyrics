Have you ever had your heart break?
Have you ever tasted that sweet smoke?
It comes in like a friend and it takes you by the hand
And it throws you from the boat down to the old cold sand
Have you ever held hands with harm?
Would you recognize the devil's charm?
It's a loser's fight when the truth hits like lightning
By the time that you have read this I'll be gone
It's a sad fact
That the old map
Can never tell you where to go
I'm an old soul
In a young shell
I broke down at the crossroads
Have you ever wandered alone?
For so very long that alone becomes your home?
It's a beautiful place, but a matter of taste
Yeah loneliness is subtle and strong
It's a sad fact
That the old map
Can never show you where to go
Im an old soul
In a young shell
I broke down at the crossroads
Silence on my radio
Silence wraps around me
Silence everywhere I go
The door slams in my face
I think its time to leave this place
