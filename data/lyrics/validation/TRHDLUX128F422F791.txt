[Verse 1]
No fear, no pain, nobody left to blame
I'll try alone, make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind
Myself I now must find
Once more, once more

[Hook]
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the Heavens I sail
If I could fly

[Verse 2]
So here I am
In solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside
I need to realise
My faith has grown
No fear of the unknown
No more, no more

[Hook]
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail
If I could fly

[Bridge]
If I could, if I could fly
If I could, if I could fly
If I could

[Hook]
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the Heavens I sail

If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail

If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
