[Verse 1]
It's been a while since the two of us talked
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain
So explain to me
How it came to this
Take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin city
On a Friday night
With vodkas and coke
I was Guinness all night

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard
Oh, who would ever thought we would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst
Before we mend
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late
Before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we stayed up all night
Best friends, yeah, talking till the daylight
We took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain
Are you hearing me?
Cuz I don't wanna miss
Set you adrift on a memory bliss
It was Grafton Street
On a rainy night
I was down on one knee
And you were mine for life

[Pre-Chorus]
We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Oh, who would ever thought we would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst
Before we mend
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late
Before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Bridge]
If the clouds don't clear
We'll rise above it
We'll rise above it (whoa)
Heaven's gate is so near
Come walk with me through
Just like we used to
Just like we used to

Yeah
Yeah

Let's take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst (before)
Before we mend (before)
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late
Before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong (all wrong)

Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong
