She makes me shudder
She makes me shake
At night i think and i want to take her away
Rainbows are on her face
Visions of tattooed chains
Egyptian rain in my world
A princess on her throne

Chorus :
Queen of the nile
Love me like an earthquake
Queen of the nile
Please let me be your king

Down by the quiet sea
No tide of hatred call to me
Queens last on through the time
I hope the stars say that she's mine

Mysterious, delirious, i wonder if she knows
Mindtamer, magicmaker, fortuneteller of long ago

Chorus

Queen of the nile
I dream all over you
Save me from all i fear
My pyramids they wait for you
