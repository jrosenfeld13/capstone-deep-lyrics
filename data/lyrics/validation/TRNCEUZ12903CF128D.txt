Disengage your fear
And see the devil in the eye
Rearrange the truth
And be a believer to the lie
Is there a way to find
Peace of mind in the life you life

Search the inner soul
And you'll find the rainbow's end again

Far away, far from here
Cross the river, on a shore of another time
Far away, far from here
Cross the river on the other side
There it lies, far away

Seek to find your remedy
Your life is on the wire
Living on the disbelief
Salvation is the crime
