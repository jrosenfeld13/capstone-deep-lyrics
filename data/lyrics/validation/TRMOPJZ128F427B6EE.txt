[Verse 1]
So glad to see you well
Overcome then completely silent now
With Heaven's help
You've cast your demons out

[Chorus]
And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead
To the dead

[Verse 2]
Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn before us all
So glad to see you well

[Chorus]
And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead
To the dead

[Bridge]
With your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down

[Hook]
And I'm more than just a little curious
(With your halo slipping down)
How you're planning to go about making your amends
(With your halo slipping down)

[Hook]
And I'm more than just a little curious
(With your halo slipping down)
How you're planning to go about making your amends
(With your halo slipping down)

[Hook]
And I'm more than just a little curious
(With your halo slipping down)
How you're planning to go about making your amends
(With your halo slipping down)

[Hook]
And I'm more than just a little curious
(With your halo slipping down)
How you're planning to go about making your amends
(With your halo slipping down)

[Outro]
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down
To choke you now
