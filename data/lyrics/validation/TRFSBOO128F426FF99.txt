I've been staring at you too long
I just want somebody to take care of me
As usual nobody pay attention
Burn down your house and let's have my apprehention
Mistakes, I make everything mistakes
But it changes so easily from love to hate

You can put me in a box and keep me there
I won't be bothering you I swear
I feel sorry for my self, I'm a nervous wreck
I can't be your dancepartner at the discoteque

Wrong, it feels so wrong, so wrong
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm strong, I thought I was strong so strong
But how I was wrong
I was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong!

You're cast all day, you're punctually late
I haven't feel I've made mistakes
You burned out my brakes
I can walk like never before
I will grow up till my head beats no more
Mistakes, I make everything mistakes
But it changes so easily from love to hate

Wrong, it feels so wrong, so wrong
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm strong, I thought I was strong so strong
But how I was wrong
I was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong!
