The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for a while
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find
I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Running down by the lakeshore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again

The boat's steaming in
I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when
I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time
That she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

-----

When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
And the hot sun chills me to the bone
When I can't hear the song for the singer
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
And the stars start to splatter in the sky
When the moon hits the southwest horizon
With the scream of an eagle on the fly
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And listen to the ripples as they moan
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

Black muddy river, roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll

When it seems like the night will last forever
And there's nothing left to do but count the years
When the strings of my heart begin to sever
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
And dream me a dream of my own
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own
