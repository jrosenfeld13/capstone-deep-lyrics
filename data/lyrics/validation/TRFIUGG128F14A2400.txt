This is the story of the fuckdoll from hell!

You want s** with a rubber doll
Baby I din't agree with that at all
Sexbomb Annie, that's her name
With her you like to play your dirty little games
Her mouth wide open, always ready for more
Doesn't close her legs, that inflatable whore
It's a love bizar with that rubber bitch
Don't make me compete with that plastic witch

You can never use me for your fantasy
Mnage  trois with my enemy
Better take her with you on Thanksgiving day
So she can meet your folks in her nglige
You take her out for dinner so your friends can see
And now everybody's pointing fingers at me
You even take her shopping and on a double date
She's always quiet and she never complains

Baby, it's her or me - my rubber enemy
Your special loverdoll - I'll nail her to the wall

I made up my mind, it's gotta stop
A stab of a needle's gonna make her go pop
That will be the end of your love affair
With Sexbomb Annie and her plastic derrire

Death to the doll
