Where do all the good souls go
It is a question
The human race needs to know
There is an idea
I'm coming
I'm coming
I am coming to grips with you
Oh I'm running yes I'm running
The fleet is a coming
I'll sail away with you
They come together by a river
One by one they go in
Indeed they share a common seat
Like it were a golden throne
I'm coming
I'm coming
I am coming to grips with you
Oh I'm running yes I'm running
The fleet is a coming
I'll sail away with you
I'm coming
I'm coming
I am coming To grips with you
Oh I'm running my heart is a thumping
The fleet is a coming I'll sail away with you
I'm coming
I'm coming
I am coming to grips with you
Oh I'm running my heart is a pumping
And Gabriel's harp's a strumming
I'll sail the sky with you
