Love me
Love me from your heart
Let us never part
Bring me all the dreams
You thought would never be
We'll make them all reality
Just you and me
You take my heart away, away
Touch me
Take me in your arms
Shelter me from harm
Let me love you
For a million years or more
I never felt this way before
Before your kiss
You take my heart away, away
You're my dream come true
Baby, I love you
I confess, I need you
I will never leave you alone
Oh, I love you too
My whole word is you
I confess, I need you
I will never leave you alone
You take my heart away
(You take my heart away) away
You take my heart away
(You take my heart away) away
You take my heart away, away
Love me, do do do
Touch me, do do do
Take me, do do do
I never felt this way before
You take my heart away
You're my dream come true
Baby, I love you
Oh, I love you too
(I love you, baby)
My whole word is you
(I love you, love you)
You're my dream come true
(Oh, baby) baby
(Oh, baby) I love you
Oh, I love you too...
