By the school
On the street
You were dropped off with a sign
"this piano is free"
You didn't look free to me

Cast aside
Obsolete
Since they cancelled music class
You've been a refugee

But now I'll give you a home
Corazon

So I pushed
And I heaved
But your weight bore down like I could not believe
Had you accepted defeat?

Till the crowd
Gathered round
Put away their goings on and hunkered down

And they were cheering you on
Corazon
Cheering you on
Corazon
Cheering you on
Corazon
Cheering you on
Corazon

And the expert
With his tools
Said to bring it up to pitch would snap the sucker in two
I guess we're tuning to you

So I pulled
Up a seat
And I swear I felt a pulse beneath your keys

To urge your hammers along
Corazon
Hammer along
Corazon
Hammer along
Corazon
Hammer along
Corazon

I was caught
I was stuck
And my thoughts kept on deepening the rut
Until your first chord struck

Now I search
I'm a chore
But my god you've given me another chance to learn

Come on and teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
Teach me your songs
Corazon
