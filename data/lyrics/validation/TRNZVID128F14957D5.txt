Ron Davies and Jeff Silbar

So that's where my head was at, in a book and a funky hat
On the road with Kerouac, searching for the truth
Sometimes I'm amazed, looking back at a certain phase
Wet my thumb and I turn the page, oh, what was I trying to prove?

Chorus:
I just shake my head and I laugh, at a faded photograph
Of a total stranger staring back at me
Now there's no man stranger to himself
Than the man he used to be

There's a closet full of worn out boots, skeletons and three-piece suits
A million hats and attitudes and very few regrets
And here I stand in faded jeans, an old t-shirt that don't say a thing
And who knows what tomorrow brings, it ain't over yet

Chorus

No some folks get me confused, with someone they once knew
I know the guy they're referring to, but he ain't been round for years

Chorus

I can see it in the eyes, it was a whole other life
Now there's no man stranger to himself
No man stranger to himself, than the man he used to be
