He met her in the fall, he took her to a movie
And when they'd done it all, he took her to a movie
And from the hospital, he took her to a movie
But so did I

And when her heart was sad, he took her to a movie
She's all he's ever had, he took her to a movie
And should their love turn bad, he took her to a movie
But so did I

I think she's been alone, he took her to a movie
When they cut off the phone, he took her to a movie
And when her cover's blown, he took her to a movie
But so did I

There's nothing on TV, he took her to a movie
But she's the one for me, he took her to a movie
We're at number three, he took her to a movie
But so did I
