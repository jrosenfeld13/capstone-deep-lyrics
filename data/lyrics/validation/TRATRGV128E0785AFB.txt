All my life I've been telling myself
I don't need no no nobody else
I'm sitting here thinking
Sittin here drinkin bout you

I look through the mirror
And all that I see
Is one crazy lonely sucker looking back at me
I'm sitting here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin bout you

I'm just a man on a mission
Tryin to make some decision
Oh what am I gonna do
Cause I ain't going nowhere
If I can't be some where with you
Boo boo boo

Ohh I'm just a man on a mission
Tryin to make some decision
Oh what am I gonna do
Cause I ain't going nowhere
If I can't be some where with you
Boo boo boo
I'm just sitting here thinkin
Sittin here drinkin bout you

Yes I'm just sitting here thinkin
Sittin here drinkin bout you
