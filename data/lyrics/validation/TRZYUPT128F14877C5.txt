I've been hanging out so long
I've been waiting on your call
Lord, I miss you

I've been sleeping all alone
I've been hanging by the phone
Want to kiss you

I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings

It's just some friends of mine that say:
"Hey, what's the matter, girl
Can you come around at 12?
There's some fine boys dying to meet you
Bring a case of wine
You know, like we used to,"

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
