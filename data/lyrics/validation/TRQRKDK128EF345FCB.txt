I should say by the way that you're acting today
I can tell by the sigh in your eye
I can sure understand by the palm of your hand
That you know I'm so hot I could fry

Because I've chased you, embraced you and turned 'round and faced you
Crowned you the truth of my youth
But you give me the line in the words of our time
It's like living a stew, that's what most lovers do
Escaping the sun, there's nowhere you can run

I believe, I believe, love's a lover's honour
I believe, I believe, love's a prima donna too

I shoulda guessed by the rest of the men that you've blessed
I'm only an eye for an eye
But you wanted a part of my innocent heart
I was only your ship in the night

I shoulda knew, shoulda knew I was out just for you
I believe in the power of the night
But like a fool I was had, now it's driving me mad
I was only a prize in your libertine eyes
I had it coming to me, I was too late to see

I believe, I believe, love's a lover's honour
I believe, I believe, love's a prima donna too

I could fight with the might of a thief in the night
I could kick, I could tear at your hair
I could break you in two like a man ought to do
But the woman I see has a right to be free
And the woman I need is a mischievous breed
Don't wanna live in a stew, that's what most lovers do
It's like escaping the sun, there's nowhere you can run

I believe, I believe, love's a lover's honour
I believe, I believe, love's a prima donna too

I believe, I believe, love's a lover's honour
I believe, I believe, love's a prima donna
I believe, I believe, love's a lover's honour
I believe, I believe, love's a prima donna
