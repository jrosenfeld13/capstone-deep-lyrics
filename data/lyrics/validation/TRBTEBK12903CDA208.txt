If love could be the answer then the answer would be you
And if I could have a feeling then I'd want it to be true
My dreams have all been broken and my past is flood with tears
Now my time is open but the feelings gone, the feeling is gone
I hold on to a reason but I've got no reason to
Try and try forever but I won't get back to you
And I'm dying to meet you, and I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you and I'm dying to have you
I can try to make you stay but the feelings gone, the feeling has gone

Now I build up strength and I build it up to
Cut away the answer and I hope I get to you
Well I'm dying to meet you, I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you and I'm dying to have you
Some things never go away but the feelings gone, the feeling is gone
