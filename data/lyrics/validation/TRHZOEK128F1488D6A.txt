Better not try to beat you tonight if I'm not the one you want
In this house of cards it would be a false alarm from the start
It's better if time stops me from trying, I just want to bring it back
If this hit place puts a smile on your face, was I born to love alone

I don't want to hear you cry no more
Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

What if know this house alone each time I took you in
There's a sound that you make when you lie to my face, don't you know?
Tell my you've changed full to the game, I'm not the one you want
It's like my heart aches with each knock that you make, I was born to love alone

I don't want to hear you cry no more
Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

Ooh it's undecided love
But you never believe me and maybe I know
Oh, honey, I know, it's undecided love
But you never believe and maybe I know
Honey I know, it's undecided love

Taking it away, you can't complain so every little blue I have
Gotta find a peace of mind when I look after the tear that's gone
Ooh, It's time to let you know
I don't want to hear you cry no more
Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long
I was waiting so long
I've been waiting so long

Ooh it's undecided love
But you never believe me and maybe I know
Oh, honey, I know, it's undecided love
But you never believe and maybe I know
Honey I know, it's undecided love
