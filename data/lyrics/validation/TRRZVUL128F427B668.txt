Seeping in from the outside
Interfering with the silence

I dropped you off and I headed home
But this apartment, it's never felt like my own
I took the long way accidentally
Searched the place but never did see
Somehow I had a feeling that I would find
Something that you'd left behind

I'm left with nothing but
This cold storm breathing its wind
Through my window cracks
Seeping in from the outside
The chilling sound cutting just right
Seeping in from the outside
Interfering with the silence
Seeping in from the outside
The chilling, it's fitting in just right

You always spoke of it
And that's exactly what it is
But you're in store for it soon, dear
So savor what you've got while you've got it

Another lonely song
Wallowing in my own self doubt
