[Verse One]
Give me that line again
He's not coming home again tonight
Mamma wipe those tears from your cheeks
It don't make no difference now
Remind me one last time that you won't never ever go
Oh the whales can't swim without the tide
And the birds won't fly without the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I can't feel without your touch
I can't dream without your smile
I can't live without your love (ohhh momma)
I cannot fall without your hand
I can't cry without your arms
I can't live without your love (ohhh momma)

[Verse Two]
Give me that song again
Hold me closer than you ever did before
When I've given all, I'll give you more
We'll keep on floating to the shore
You can take a storm and turn it all around
And then the sun shines through
Oh the story of your life
We have all been designed
But as real on the outside

[Chorus]
I can't feel without your touch
I can't dream without your smile
I can't live without your love (ohhh momma)
I cannot fall without your hand
I can't cry without your arms
I can't live without your love (ohhh momma)

[Outro]
See when it all comes back around
And he still can't figure out how he let you get away
Just keep your head up high
And know it's better off that way
