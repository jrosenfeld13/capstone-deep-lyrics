Just because the earth is round, don't mean you've got the right
To treat it like it was a basketball
Pass it to the left, shoot it from the right
Destroying it is gonna take it's toll...

Oh no, I don't feel so good
The world keeps spinning, here comes lunch

Just because the earth is round, don't mean you got the right
To kick it like it was a soccer ball
Kick it to the ground, pass it to the sky
Destroying it is gonna take it's toll...

Oh no, I don't feel so good
The world keeps spinning, here comes lunch

All the dumping and spilling and burning and killing that's going on all over the globe
How will the dumping and spilling and burning and killing affect us? Nobody knows
Some wreck the state of the earth, some cry for the sky
It don't make a difference, we're the ones who are gonna die

Oh no, I don't feel so good
The world keeps spinning...
