Bring your head against the wall
So I can see where I will fall
Bring your mind into my head
Find your playing den

All in all it's just a start
All we had was more than that
All in all I can't go back
To where we started out

So bring my head up to Mont Blanc
So you will see what you would find
Bring my head against the wall
So you can see where I will go

All in all it's just your fault
Made me feel respect no more
All in all I can't go back
Blind my mind inside

Bring my mind inside your head
So you can see where I went then
Bring your head against the wall
So I can see where I will fall

All in all it's just your fault
Made me feel respect no more
All in all I can't go back
Blind My mind inside
Blind My mind inside

All your lies
Made me feel respect no more
All your lies
Blind My mind inside
All your lies
Made me feel respect no more
All your lies
Made me feel respect no more
All your lies
Blind My mind inside
All your lies
Made me feel respect no more
All your lies
Blind My mind inside
Blind My mind inside
Blind My mind inside
