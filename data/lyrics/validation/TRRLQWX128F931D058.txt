[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Before the lakes and rivers were polluted
Before the animals were poached to extinction
And before man had destroyed the earth's atmosphere
There was a great ship
This vessel was to venture into new waters
To find new resources, to make life easier and more enjoyable
It was a simple mission for the crew
Who were excited to be a part of this union
They pledged their allegiance to the captain
And vowed to be there no matter what
In sickness, health, and possible death
As time passed by, there was no new land to be found
As the days grew shorter
And the nights grew longer and colder
The crew became more and more skeptical about the captain's Vision
Originally passionate and committed true and faithful
They now began to revolt

[Chorus]
You crossed the line
I was honest
I never promised anything
Just a brotherhood to stand for something
And everyone should take the lead
Follow your dreams
If you don't try, you fail

[Verse 2]
As the mutiny started and the captain was overthrown and chained
He asked them why their minds had changed
There's no gold to be found, no treasure in the ground
We won't die for this
We won't die for you

[Chorus]
You've lost your minds
I was honest
I never promised anything
Just a brotherhood to stand for something
And even if they disagree
Follow your dreams
If you don't try, you fail

[Verse 3]
This dream is now
A shipwreck in the sand
They gave up, they made all their demands
The storm consumed fifty seven souls
Who died in vain, his love they stole

[Outro][x3]
This union, a battle fought and lost
This union is not about the cause
This union was never about love
(This union)[x2]
