Never ever, felt this way about...
The things you do to me
Never ever knew, couldn't do without
You and me

But I didn't read between your lines
And I didn't know there was no one like you to find

Why didn't I see
This before

Why didn't I come
Back for more

Now I do feel
The pain inside

Now I have seen
All I can do is hide and..

Cry...
All I can do is
Cry

Cry...
All I can do is
Cry
Like this

Cry...
All I can do is
Cry
Like this

Maybe one day I will realize
That you're gone

Maybe now I can't see the world apply
Has become

The beginning of a
Lonely night

The beginning of a love
'Cause these words linger in my mind

Why didn't I see
This before

Why didn't I come
Back for more

Now, I do feel
The pain inside

Now, I have seen
All I can do is hide and..

Cry...
All I can do is
Cry
Like this
