Time has come
On my own
I dont know if i'll survive
One more lonely night
Everyday, insecurities , how they creep into my life
They're breaking me everytime
You got the cure that i need
You give me something to take away the pain (hmm mm)
So baby give it to me
I need you're lovin' to make me feel again

Chorus:
I want you to staaaaaayyy
Baby take you're lovin' till the morning light
Just staaaaayyy
I know you can help me make it through the night
Cause when you're holding me
From reality , you keep the tears away
Just stayyy
Set me free
Insanitys driving me out of my mind
You can make it right
Hold me close, deep inside
Take me to heaven tonight
You got the fix that I need
So come on baby
Put sugar on my pain ( hmm mm)
The way you give it to me
I know you're lovin' will make me feel again
Chorus
Take me deep inside the moment
Give a little sweetness to my soul
Can't you feel my body calling
Baby don't you go (go)
Chorus
Just Stay ( just staayyyyy)
