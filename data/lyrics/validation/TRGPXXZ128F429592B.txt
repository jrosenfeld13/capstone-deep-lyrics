And on a different day
You'll get your chance you know
And on a different day
You'll find the path to go
Justify your prayers

I show you patience, you show me pain
I give you time, you're always late
I make you strong, you choose to fail
I give you cash, the one thing you do is
Take it
Take it
Take it
Take it

And on a different day
Our fading friendship fails
And I will mourn the day
So justify your prayers

I show you patience, you show me pain
I give you time, you're always late
I make you strong, you choose to fail
I give you cash, the one thing you do is
Take it
Take it
Take it
Take it

Justify your prayers

I show you patience, you show me pain
I give you time, you're always late
I make you strong, you choose to fail
I give you cash, the one thing you do is
Take it
Take it
Take it
Take it
