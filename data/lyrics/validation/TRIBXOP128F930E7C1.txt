Sammy was a skin living in a danger zone
People were fighting with him everyday
His number one defense was throwing his knuckles up
And showing the world the price they had to pay

An eye for an eye, and everything in between
An eye for an eye, and we'll pay the prince
An eye for an eye, you defied your maker
An eye for an eye and we'll all be blind

One fine day he was told of the one true life
That he was called to something more than just another fight
So throw down your dukes Sammy tell them what you know
That if you fight then you will die and reap what you've sown

Hang him from a tree and burn his house down
If that's the way you want it then we'll be in the ground
