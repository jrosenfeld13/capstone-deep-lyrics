Room 421
An airport hotel
I know I should be sleeping
But it's too soon to tell
If I'll fly out tomorrow
If I'll see her tomorrow
I hope that I will
No place like alone
And no sound like my own voice
Fading into
This quiet december night
But I'm doing alright
I 'll make a phone call or two

Could I get some room service please?
Send the maid in to see
About a few things I need

"Do you think you could
Bring me my girlfriend
And a bottle of wine
Bring me a future
Just make sure it's mine
Will you open the window
But leave out the cold
Could you make a phone call to Jesus
To clean up my soul"

Miles from my own bed
Further from content
I guess I should get used to this
Still rain on the runway
But I'm doing okay
I 've got cigarettes to kiss

"Could I get some room service please?
I 'm down on my knees
I 'm only here for tonight
'cause they fucked up my flight
Serenading the wall
And I thought I should call
You to ask for it all
For it all
For it all

Remember to

Bring me my girlfriend
And a bottle of wine
Bring me a future
Make sure it's mine
Will you open the window
But leave out the cold
Could you make a phone call to jesus
To clean up my soul."

Dial seven for a savior
"is this soul keeping please...
Could you put me through to jesus
I 'll pay your long-distance fees"
He said "hello and god bless you
There's a bible in the drawer."
I said "that's wonderful sir. but I don't read it anymore"
I don't read it any more...

Bring me my girlfriend
And a bottle of wine
Bring me a future
Make sure it's mine
Will you open the window
But leave out the cold
Could you make a phone call to jesus
To clean up my soul"
Bring me my girlfriend
And a bottle of wine
Bring me a future
Just make sure it's mine
Will you open the window
But leave out the cold
Could you make a phone call to Jesus
To clean up my soul"
Yeah
Could you bring me my girlfriend
Yeah
Bring me a smile

A cleveland hotel
