A little bird
Told me a secret today
I closed my eyes and wish that he'd fly away
When you're blind with love
When you're blind with love
You need a seeing eye friend
Now I'm a part of a circle
In a line of well-informed friends...
Tell me things
I don't want to know about
I don't need to know about
Friends tell me things
I don't really want to know
About the uncouncious entertainer
Unaware of the show
For the ticket price
Is he the last to know?
The unconcious entertainer
Unaware of the show
For the ticket price
Is he the last to know?

Truth or dare
Dare I tell what I know?
Your Pseudo love's been walked all over
Am I friend or foe?
Am I friend or foe?
Both sides wrestle
Neither side knows

There's truth to tell
You won't hear it from me
In fact, if the truth be known
You won't hear it from anybody else around here either
You think it'd be ther easiest thing in the world to walk right up and tell you
And I carry it around like an egg on a spoon
Since none of us have the guts to break the news
Instead we'll wait and see if it breaks your heart

You're the last to know
You're the last to know
And we've got our seats for the too late show
The unconcious entertainer
Unaware of the show
For the ticket price
Is he the last to know?
The unconcious entertainer
Unaware of the show
For the ticket price is he the last to know?
The last to know...
The last to know...
The last to know...
