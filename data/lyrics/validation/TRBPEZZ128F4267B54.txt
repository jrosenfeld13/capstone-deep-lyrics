The doctor said come back again next week, I think that you need me
All she did was cry
She wanted to die
Doctor when can you see me?
There's a guy out there! seems like he's everywhere!
It just ain't fair!

Heartless-heartless! never never out of control
Heartless-heartless! you keep on sinin' in the name of rock and roll
Heartless-heartless! he thinks it's so cool to be cold
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul

Late night in the penthouse room, the fire is burning
Shadows are warm, laying in his arms she answers his yearning
Her eyes are filled with sand

Heartless-heartless! never out of control
Heartless-heartless! sin in the name of rock and roll
Heartless-heartless! he thinks it's so cool to be cold
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul
