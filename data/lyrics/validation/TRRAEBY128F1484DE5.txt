[Intro]
What'll I do for satisfaction?
Honey, you take care of me now
If you leave I can't make it
Darlin' please, don't you put me down

[Chorus]
'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away your heart
'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
When that funny, funny feeling's gone
Oh, what'll I do?

[Verse 1]
I can't take no more of missin' you
I don't know just what I'm gonna do
How can I love another?
You don't know just what you mean to me

[Chorus]
'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away, away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction?
When my nights start to gettin' long

[Ad lib]
Oh no no
Boy, I love you
Wanna hold you
Love hey yea yea

[Verse 2]
Your love's strong, that's no lie
And I hate, I hate to put it down
But if you, you leave me now
You won't want, want me hangin' around

[Chorus]
'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away, away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction?
When that funny, funny feeling's gone

[Breakdown]
Oh, I need you now
What'll I do baby?
What'll I do baby?
What'll I do baby?
What'll I do baby?
What'll I do babe?
I said a naa naa naa

[Outro]
Hey hey hey
That's what I say
Hey hey hey
That's what I say
Can you want me?
What'll I do, babe?
Can you love me?
What'll I do, baby?
I said a naa naa naa
I said a naa naa naa
I said a naa naa naa
I said a naa naa naa
