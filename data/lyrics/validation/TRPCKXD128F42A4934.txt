Our numbers are growing stronger
Can't ignore us any longer
Old school to new tell your crew
We've got a long way to go before we're through
But together, we'll make them hear our voice
Raise your fist, make a stand
We'll make them understand

The kids are growing stronger
Our voices are getting louder

The only difference is their weakness
We'll make the difference
Raise your fist right now

Can you be strong?
Can you hold on?

The kids are growing stronger
Voices getting louder
Comitting to making a change
We'll fight the power in charge

This time we'll make them say
