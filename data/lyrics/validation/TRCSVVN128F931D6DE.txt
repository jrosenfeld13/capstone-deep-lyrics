Lock the god-damn door
Blockade your fucking floor
And just wait for the first all-clear to come
Nail up all your frames
Looks like they won't play games
You hear them clear on the streets
Order to stay at home

They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
Hear! They come
Here they come

The devils horde released
Hear! They come
Here they come and you're gonna be their feast

Hear! They come
Here they come and don't get caught outside
Or you will be dead meat

Home meat home
Home meat home
They're scratching at your door
Snarling from the floor

You can't wait for the first all-clear to come
Nails drill through the frames
No they don't play games
Hear their screams in the streets
They gonna visit your home

They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
Hear! They come
Here they come

The devils horde released
Hear! They come
Here they come and you're gonna be their feast
Hear! They come
Hear they come and don't get caught outside
Or you will be dead meat

My door is just wood
But my will is iron
My door is just wood
But my will is iron

Home meat home
Home meat home
