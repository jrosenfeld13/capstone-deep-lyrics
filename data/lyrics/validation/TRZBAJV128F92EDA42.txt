This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
All in my home
I'm gonna let it shine
All in my room
I'm gonna let it shine, Shine now
The road was ruff (through the dark)
The way was long
I kept on singing that freedom song
My god promised me a rainbow sign
Just gotta let my little light shine
Don't give up
Don't back down
Don't let the liar turn you around
My heart's fixed
Way up in mind
I'm going out and let my little light shine
Shure gonna let my little light shine
All in the streets
I'm gonna let it shine
All in the battlefield
I'm gonna let it shine
See now I ain't gonna fightin no rich man's war
That ain't what God wanted use me for
Killing folks it ain't in my line
Shure ain't no way to let my little light shine
Shine on me
Shine on me
Let the light from the lighthouse
..shine on me
You can't fool all the people all the time
Get together let our little light shine
(oh yes)
Let it shine x4
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
When it's cold
Let it shine
When the liar calls
Let it shine
In my home
Let it shine
In my room
Let it shine
When hatred calls
Let it shine
When it shines
Freedom shines
When it shines
No more sorrow
When it shine
No more pain
When it shine
Oh lord
When it shine
...
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
