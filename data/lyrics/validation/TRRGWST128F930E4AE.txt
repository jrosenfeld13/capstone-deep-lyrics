You push
You shove
You do all that you can
And time, it slips away
Everything will keep it some place
And all that I say

When the distance
Keeps us distant
You know I'll always think about you
Even when I'm
Not all there
The love I have is yours
Baby it's yours

You sit
You wait
You do all you can
And life, it fades away
But don't forget
The soul that you have
And all that we say

Dark days come and
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have, baby it's yours
It's yours

Forget the things that people say to try to hurt you
Forget their fears that overtake them in their lives
Forget this world with all it's petty disappointments
But don't forget that your the lovely person I love so

Dark days come in
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have is yours
It's yours

Ooh.......
