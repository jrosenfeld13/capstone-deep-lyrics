I need more time to be understood
I'll take your time and I'll make it good
I'll follow your smile to a different place and trace your lips in a warm embrace

I need more time to be on my own
The in-crowds crowds is a crowd gone home
The streets can tell all you need to know of who's been friend and of who's been foe

People we meet just walk on by
They paint what they want and then watch it dry
So colour my eyes from violet to blue
My body can't lie when it's next to you

I need more time and my alibi is when I dream
It's with you I fly high over the top of the universe
Then back to earth where it's all rehearsed

People we meet just walk on by
They paint what they want and then watch it dry
So colour my eyes from violet to blue
My body can't lie when it's next to you

Like people
People we meet
Like people
Like people we meet
Like people
