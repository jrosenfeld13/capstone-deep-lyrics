Stand witness, world evil, how cheap is life
Indifference to reason, we watch them die

Cut down, starved to death, it's only life
Face down in the street, close your eyes
We don't want to watch millions die
Cold world
Who will speak against these crimes
Most say I'm alright, I've got what's mine
Anyhow, whose got the fucking time
Cold world

Stand witness, world evil, how cheap is life
Indifference to reason, we watch them die

Stand witness, world evil, how cheap a life
Indifference to reason, we watch them die
