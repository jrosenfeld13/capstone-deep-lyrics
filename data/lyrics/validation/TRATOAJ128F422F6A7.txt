[Intro]
We do away with your kind
Countdown to exterminate the human race
Zero, 3, 2, 1
Let chaos entwine, on defenceless soil
Remove errors of man, and sweep away all the weakening kind

[Verse 1]
I am war, I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief, I am lies

[Intro 2]
Bygone are tolerance and presence of grace
Scavengers are set out to clean the human filth parade

[Verse 2]
I am pure, I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh, I am smile
I am the earth defiled

I am the cosmic storms
I am the tiny worms
I am fear in the night
I am the bringer of light

Earth, successfully, erased
