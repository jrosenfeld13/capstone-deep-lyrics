I watch, play, I hear you say
New things to me every day
And I'm amazed that you're here
Never knew that I could feel so sincere

The tide is changing fast
How long will these days last?

Could we be a little more mature
To ensure this love will endure?
The gift of love is not promised
So at night, I still pray you'll always want this

The world is changing fast
And I'll love as long as love last

When you came into the world, you stole that show
And it's been a pleasure to watch you grow
When I look to your eyes I know I done good
And I wouldn't change one moment if I could

Our family is growing nicely
And our waistlines ate growing slightly
But, I take every day as it comes to me
Waiting on God to fulfill my destiny
