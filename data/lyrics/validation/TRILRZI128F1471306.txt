I got a crack in my windshield
I know exactly how it feels
It's comin' apart the hard way
It gets a little more shattered each day

[Chorus:]

Oh oh oh, I'm breaking slow motion
Oh oh oh, how did it hit me so fast
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad
Somebody tell me how long it will last
'Cause oh oh oh, I'm breaking in slow motion
Feels like I'm frozen in a dream
I can't run, can't even scream
I'm trying to fight but I can't get my fist up
How does somebody get so messed up

[Chorus]

Let go, let go
Why can't I make myself do it
I don't know
Oh...

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh, I'm breaking in slow motion
