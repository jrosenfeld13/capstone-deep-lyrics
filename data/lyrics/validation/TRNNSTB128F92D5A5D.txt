Atop the tours of ancient lore lies a beast
On mortal flesh it waits to feast
A symbol of malice
A symbol of war
Is the wyverns guise
From broken slumber it shall arise
A figure disturbs the mistfall shrouds that veiled it's lair
An eminent form soars through the air
Summoned by thunderous clouds the foreboding fear
A storm of unquenchable fire draws near

A fiery gaze from sanguine eyes
That pierce the spirit of light
Forests ablaze the echoing cries
Of being bereft of might
A dark might so rare
Of evils birth
The souls of the craven burn
Talons that tear the flesh of the earth
The wrath of the Black Wyvern

Behold the majestic grace of the feared
Capping jaws that leave forsaken lands sacred
Wings that ride the ethereal midnight sky
Invincible armor of blackened scale

A lord of darkness bringing tidings of bale
The advent of light serpent is nigh
All fear the bewinged upon
The night of the Black Wyvern

Unceasing flames devour all with great celerity
Relentless war shakes the land with undying potency
An eerie mist...
In place of pious men that govern with insanity
A dragon king to rule this realm for all eternity
