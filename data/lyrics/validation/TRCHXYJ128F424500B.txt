There's an accident just waiting to happen
Looks like my old heart has got a brand new captain
Letting go of all the things I know
With both eyes closed to the unknown

There's a big black hole waiting to open
One out of three hearts has to be broken
Letting go of all the things I know
With both eyes closed to the unknown

I could say I'm sorry but I'm not
Whatever I promised I forgot
There's a riot inside me breaking out
Building up, crashing down

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

The grass is growing green up on my desk side
Is this the real tsunami or a weak tide?
Letting go of all the things I know
With both eyes closed to the unknown

I could say I'm sorry bug I'm not
Whatever I promised I forgot
There's a riot inside me breaking out
Building up, building up

I could say I'm sorry but I'm not
Whatever I promised I forgot
There's a riot inside me breaking out
Building up, crashing down
Building up, crashing down

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

I could say I'm sorry but I'm not
Whatever I promised I forgot
There's a riot inside me breaking out
Building up, building up

I could say I'm sorry but I'm not
Whatever I promised I forgot
There's a riot inside me breaking out
Building up, crashing down

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
