Well
If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
'Cause I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Yes I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me

Ive never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I dont take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
Of flesh, blood and bone
But if you're gonna start a rumble
Don't you try it on alone
My name is misery
Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me

If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
'Cause I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Yes I'm evil, baby, so don't you mess around with me
I said I'm evil, baby, don't you mess around with me
