I can't eat, I can't sleep
I'm nothing short of a mess
I can't concentrate
I lose track of time
All I wanna do is talk to you
Yes, talk to you

I'm trying desperately
To memorize your words
They make me feel so young
They make me feel like I am the one
The one you've always needed
You're the reason I'm breathing

I watch you
And patiently know
That only time will tell
If our roles will grow

But no matter what
I just gotta say
I have never been so happy
And I will always love you

I'm trying desperately
To memorize your words
They make me feel so young
They make me feel like I am the one
You're the reason that I am breathing

I'm trying desperately
To memorize your words
They make me feel young
They make me feel like I am the one
The one you needed
You're the reason that I am breathing

You're the reason that I am breathing

I watch you
And patiently know
That only time will tell
If our roles will grow
