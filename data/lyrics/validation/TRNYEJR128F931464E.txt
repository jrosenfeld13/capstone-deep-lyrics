Why deal?
And end of will
To fire along
And it's not not not a lie

I don't know
If I can lead
The willing beast
And he's why why why white?

Sordid lies
And I'm awake
Hot in here tonight
And there's not a lot a lot of light

What are you and
What is he?
Opposed to war
And I said said said aloud

Monkey ray
And in my way
The wing collide
And it's low low lonely

Seems to be
That we could eat
The world of wars
And I'm wow wow wow wound
