(Holly Williams)

A memory falls down from where it was
With this confession I beg for more
I never mean to and it's been awhile
Since I found meaning in these desires
I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

Fire and blankets, a cheap parade
Of guilty pleasures, I take the stage
But nothing feels good if it ain't true
It's like trying to cry for someone you never knew
I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like kid

I love you with more tears than any pain could ever bring me
I fight it most everyday
I hurt you with more truth than your own eyes could ever teach you
I'm tired of living this way, when I know it's wrong

I never told you, you just kinda knew
By the way I'm not when I'm with you
You never take me like you used to
And nothing heals the scars of all the ones we never knew

I love you with more tears than any pain could ever bring me
I fight it most everyday
I hurt you with more truth than your own eyes could ever teach you
I'm tired of living this way, when I know it's wrong

I know it's wrong to hurt you again
