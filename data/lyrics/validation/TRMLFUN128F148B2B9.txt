When I think about it when I got so much that I just can't complain and if I choose to believe something
New you can't con sev cause the thoughts are confined how you gonna find the nerve to believe that you
Thought you'd be mine he's what I feel inside

I just dont wanna be misunderstood nobody telling me whats wrong or right bad or good cause I'm grown
I wanna feel free to release it if thats the way I'm feeling I wanna believe who I am to be and if I feel
Disrespected that should be respected thats right above restriction of opinions how ever I whatever I

Don't think I'm selfish don't let it be a day when I'm feeling that the world is mine oh I'll make no
Mistake cause its alright and even if I'm feelin' like I wanna complain that my right and if I choose to
Lie, cuss, buss, or fight damn right

I just dont wanna be misunderstood nobody telling me whats wrong or right bad or good cause I'm grown
I wanna feel free to release it if thats the way I'm feeling I wanna believe who I am to be and if I feel
Disrespected that should be respected thats right above restriction of opinions how ever I whatever I

I wanna feel free to release it if thats the way I'm feeling I wanna believe who I am to be and if I feel
Disrespected that should be respected thats right above restriction of opinions how ever I whatever I

I wanna feel free to release it if thats the way I'm feeling I wanna believe who I am to be and if I feel
Disrespected that should be respected thats right above restriction of opinions how ever I whatever I
