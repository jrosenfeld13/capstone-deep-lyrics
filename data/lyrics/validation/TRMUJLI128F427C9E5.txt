Songs of innocence play a sour tune
You tune the dial, but the static still remains
We fear the silence, so let's listen to the faceless name
Don't swing on my emotions and play off my actions

This isn't going to be another shot in the dark
But only another step closer to seperation

I'm not going to run this race forever
And this has everything to do with what you said last night
Ride the railroad that drives the nails and write it down in your diary
Because this is better than a photograph

This isn't going to be another shot in the dark
But only another step closer to seperation

Remember not remembering?
It all ends here sometimes
Do you remember when we couldn't remember?
It all ends here sometimes

Let's sit back, tip the glass, and say those were the days
Because this is where the sidewalk ends

Waving your hands goodbye
Please don't make me say the bitter words
This tears me apart...
Goodbye
