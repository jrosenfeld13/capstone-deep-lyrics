I looked at the moon so full and bright
And then at the fireplace, when it's flickering light
And realize why this world will never be right
Then I threw another log on the fire

Inside these 4 walls, I am a king
But beyond that door, it doesn't mean a thing
I pay all my dues, till I have only a portion of membership in world happiness
And my blood runs freely in Vietnam
So I threw another log on the fire

Why do you insist on keeping us caged?
You know all that does is intensify rage
The word knowledge sees the time
And all power to the people!
Power to the people!
Then I threw another log on the fire

Putting us in a cage was a mistake
All that did was intensify hate
Now (?) to our cages, you expect us to wait?'
While you fool around on the moon
And from there look for another place to conquer
While i throw another log on the fire

America, UR, you're just doing fine
These racial things however do take time
While I'm tired waiting not getting mind
(Me too!)
Except however in Vietnam
Where every dead black man is a credit to his race
Eh, as long as he remembers his place
So I threw another log on the fire

Quit to put pencil to paper, it can wait
What's right must explain before it's too late
The flames are at their peaks now, can't wait
Too many broken promises
Too many black babies asking "Why?...."
Too many restless armies in the ghetto
So i'll just throw another log on the fire

A man can walk proudly
Down in the streets
A man's not ashamed
Of what he believes
He knows how to laugh
He knows how to cry
He knows how to live
He's not afraid to die
What is a man?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me Otis
What is a man?
