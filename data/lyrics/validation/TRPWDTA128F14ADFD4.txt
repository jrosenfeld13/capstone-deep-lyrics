All of my life I've been hearing
That Jesus is coming back someday
For two thousand years the world's been waiting
He just told us to watch and pray

We don't know the minute nor the hour
But the signs that the Bible speaks about
All point to the day of His returning
It's happening now

We may be the raptured generation
Rumors of war are in the air
Nation is rising against nation
False messiahs are appearing everywhere

The word's being preached to all the nations
There's famine and flood, earthquakes and drought
The Jews have gone back to claim Jerusalem
It's happening now

Let the righteous rejoice at the sound of His voice
Let the word be proclaimed
Let the word be proclaimed
Let the message be sent to receive
And repent for He's coming again
Coming again

Let the righteous rejoice at the sound of His voice
Let the word be proclaimed
Let the word be proclaimed
Let the message be sent to receive
And repent for He's coming again

The hands on the clock are moving faster
Humanity's sun is going down
With each passing day the time grows
Shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter
It's happening now, it's happening now
