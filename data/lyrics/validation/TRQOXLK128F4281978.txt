14th of June 1912

I woke up feeling sprightly
Then I got out of bed, thought mama: "you done me proud"
Looked over the kitchen sink
Thought wow, that's my house
I paid the mortgage, it's mine
Got up, cup of coffee, went down nice tonight
Made me feel a bit moodkey
Then I sit up straight and proud, I knew I was a man
Thought mama: "he done me proud"

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

We wear friendly smiles
All night

Get blooded on lucifer's grave
Pray it never stop

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

So a car pulls up, and that guy downstairs
I'm wearing my best trousers
I'm feeling happy
Sunlight was shining down
I'm wearing toxsome blue shoes, with a crisp lime jazzerline
Beautiful here, the day's beautiful too

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

We wear friendly smiles
All night

Get blooded on lucifer's grave
Pray it never stop

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

Crash bang and I made it out she's actually beautiful
She stands alone, not caring who's looking
Her name's Rebecca Trollop and I fall right into her trap
Bang, it's disgusting

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

We wear friendly smiles
All night

Get blooded on lucifer's grave
Pray it never stop

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man
