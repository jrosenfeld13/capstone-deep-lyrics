Gather every nature child
Gather all and merry me
For tonight let us be wild
And tonight let us be free!

Dance, dance in the Fire of Love
Dance, dance in the Fire of Love

Underneath this endless sky
We will dance till eternity
Raise your arms with a primal cry
For tonight we shall be free

We are the Wild Ones
Children ever free
We have the Spirit
Within both you and me

Queen of the Moon
Queen of the Night
Be with us round the fire tonight
