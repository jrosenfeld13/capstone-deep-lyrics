Each day connects to the next
I do my routines by reflex
Life's an endless row of days
But the heart longs to get away

And I wish I could fly out of here
Out of this town

Let no routine keep us down
And foe once let not tv
Run our lives
So I one day can say true
I have lived once too

And I wish I could fly out of here
Out of this town
I'd follow the wind
Leave everything behind
That holds me down

I wish I could fly away from here
Out of this town
I'd leave them all behind
Where they are stuck
Waiting for life
(Love)
