I am a man of constant sorrow;
I've seen trouble all my day
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

All through this world, I'm bound to ramble
Through storm and wind, through sleet and rain
I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Your friends they say I am a stranger
You'll never see my face no more
There is just one promise that's given
We'll sail on God's Golden Shore

I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised
