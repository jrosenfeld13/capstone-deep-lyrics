When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when the air freshener wins
And the weeds, the wild weeds lose

When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when the antidepressant wins
And the fresh air and the world lose

When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when Lake Wildwood wins
And the wild weeds lose

When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when the air conditioning wins
And the moon outside is the loser

When we refuse to feel
When we refuse to suffer
We think we're cheating and winning
But we're not
We don't get anywhere
We pay the price

When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when the air freshener wins
And the real winds lose

When we refuse to suffer
When we refuse to feel
That's when the indoor fake world wins
When the antidepressant lozenge wins
When the Prozac pill wins
And you lose
