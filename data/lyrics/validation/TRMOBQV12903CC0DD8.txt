Live come to the end
Nowhere to go
Look back and see
Remains, left in the road
Can't keep me behind closed doors
Or locked up in a cage
I'll rise again
My stregth comes from my pain
Time to break free
Don't hold me back
The world is mine
Be it cruel and unkind
Voices, in my head tell me I'm insane
Voices, me grita en mi cabeza
Voices, are to blame
VOICES, SCREAMING INSIDE MY HEAD
