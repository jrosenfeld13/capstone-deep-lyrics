[Chorus 1][x2]
Slipping and a sliding, peeping and a hiding
Been told a long time ago

[Chorus 2]
I been told, baby, you been bold
I won't be your fool no more

[Chorus 3][x2]
Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jiver
I done got hip to your jive

[Chorus 4]
Slipping and a sliding, peeping and a hiding
Won't be your fool no more

[Chorus 5][x2]
Oh, Malinda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2]
