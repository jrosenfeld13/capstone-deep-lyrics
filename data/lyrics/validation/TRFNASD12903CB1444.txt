Oh, she was satan in high heels
And came over straighter
A 666 mark on her wrist
It smelt like sex, it smelt like rock and roll

And it smells like rock and roll
Baby shake your ass for me
Oh baby shake your ass for me
You're like sex, you're like rock and roll

Like a fast car she drove me far
A million miles, an open string machine
Oh how it seemed, not to end
You're like sex, you're like rock and roll

And it smells like rock and roll
Baby shake your ass for me
Oh baby shake your ass for me
You're like sex, you're like rock and roll

Oh it smells like rock and roll
Baby shake your ass for me
Oh baby shake your ass for me
You're like sex, you're come on!

Shake, shake, shake, your ass for me
Shake, shake, shake, your ass for me
Shake, shake, shake, your ass for me
Shake, shake, shake, your ass for me
