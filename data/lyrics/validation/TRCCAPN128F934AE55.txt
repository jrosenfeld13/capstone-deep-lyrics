As you stand before the gates of hell the future so unclear
As you stand before the gates of hell the devil draws you near

War Eternal

The doomed one slowly beckons and draws you to his side
He speaks the curse to take your soul along the midnight ride

War Eternal

When he looks into your eyes the skin melts off your back
And when he gets you all alone you know he'll soon attack

War Eternal

He starts to rob you of your soul you're trying to fight back
Curse the beast and raise your sword to launch the first attack

War Eternal

The war that stands eternal the battle you can't win
He'll rule the world and if he can't he'll burn it down with him
