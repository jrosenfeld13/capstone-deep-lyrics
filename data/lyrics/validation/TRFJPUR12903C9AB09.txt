I'm sleeping, sleeping, to encompass myself
I wake up, wake up, then distribute what's left

[Chorus]
With my anger well defused
The link of love I now may choose
With my heart no more abused
The link of love I now may use

I'm sleeping, sleeping, to develop myself
I wake up, wake up, & then relinquish what's left

[Chorus]
I was caught by your lies spinning
Then was saved by truth's opinion
All's quiet now

[Chorus x2]...
...The link to love I may choose
...The link of love I may use
