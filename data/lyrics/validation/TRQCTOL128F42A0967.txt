[Verse 1]
Easy come love, weighing satisfaction
But that's not enough as time goes by
Some say love leads to distraction
And love is a game where the players never win

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're close to me and we are as one
I'll let my heart believe that a new day has begun
And I feel no shame 'cause it's the same old love

[Chorus]
Off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
It's the same old love (love)

[Verse 2]
Friend or foe, make your decision
Just let me know if it's do or die, yeah
Take it slow, love can be a prison
An eternal flame that never burns to an end

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my destiny and you are the one
I try desperately to hold on to my heart
Here I go again, facing the same old love

[Chorus]
Off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
It's the same old love (love)

[Bridge]
People change the moment that they get love
They don't understand how love can turn
Love can bring pain, but don't you regret love
Today your heart's breaking in two
But tomorrow someone cries for you

[Chorus]
Oh oh, off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
It's the same old love (love, love)

I just said it was love
Crazy mad about love
(Crazy mad about love)
Don't be sad about love
(Can't be sad, it's the same old love
The same old love)

Off and on again, love
(Off and on again, love)
To the moon again, love
(To the moon again, love)
Can't be wrong if it's love
(It's the same old love)

All day, mad again, love
(All day, mad again, love)
Feeling bad again, love
(Got me mad again, love)
Can't be sad about love
It's the same old love

(Same, same, same)
Off and on again, love
To the moon again, love
Can't be wrong if it's love
(Same old love, same old love)
