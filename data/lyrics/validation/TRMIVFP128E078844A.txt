Breathe in and breathe out
Revenge
Fearsome plans
You stepped on my feelings now
Stepped on my feelings now

The debts
Have been paid and the war is out of date
You've stabbed my back before my friend
Stabbed my back before my friend

What makes you mess up my life?

And what is bothering you?
Am I a nail in your mind?
This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far

Don't trust you
Get out of my life

Love has been hateful to us
Why lie to me?

The war in you is bothering me
I've never been an, an, an enemy
Breathe in and breathe out
Love is eating us
Like you are eating me

You can save me
I can hold you
War is out of date
Why lie to me?

Why lie to me?
Why lie to me?
I am hurt

Don't trust you
You are a fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey
Fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey
You are a fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey
Fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey, fuckmonkey

Fuckmonkey
