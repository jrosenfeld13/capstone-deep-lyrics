[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?

[Chorus]
Its not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe were better off this way?
Im not fine, Im in pain
Its harder everyday
Maybe were better off this way?
Its better that we break

[Verse 2]
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I cant see it clearly
While youre standing there, it disappears
It disappears

[Chorus]
Its not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe were better off this way?
Im not fine, Im in pain
Its harder everyday
Maybe were better off this way?
Its better that we break

[Verse 3]
Saw you sitting all alone
Youre fragile and youre cold, but thats all right
Life these days is getting rough
Theyve knocked you down and beat you up
But its just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

[Chorus]
Its not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe were better off this way?
Im not fine, Im in pain
Its harder everyday
Maybe were better off this way?
Im not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe were better off this way?
Im not fine, Im in pain
Its harder everyday
Maybe were better off this way?
Its better that we break, baby
