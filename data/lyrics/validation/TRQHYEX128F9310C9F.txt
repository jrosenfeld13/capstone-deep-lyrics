Checked-in at the airport half an hour late
Jackie caused a scene when we reached the gate
Sorry Mr. Pilot but you'll have to wait
Cause Paul's still in the duty free

When I'm far from home
You call me on the phone
Tell me everything that's happening in England
When I'm feeling blue
You call me something new
Another stupid name that makes me smile
And in a while

Ooh another coffee yeah
Ooh can you sense it in the air
Feels so good
Like someone really cares

Built my world around certain things you say
I think of nothing else at the close of day
Except for maybe how I ended up this way
Another drink before you go

MTV is on another dreary song
20 after 2 and I'm at a loss
Cause the hotel bar is closed
I walk across the road
Sound of Radio Boston makes me smile
And in a while
