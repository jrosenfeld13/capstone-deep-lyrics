When the rodeo was over, we're all go to the room
We're drink some beer relax awhile and sing some cowboy tunes
That old guitar we passed around, it was battered, scratched, and
Broke
But Lord it sounded mighty fine, when John Ed sang "Cowpoke"

Ben he's think of some old tune, and he's really wail away
Dunder's play the spoons and sing until the break of day
Clyde he's tell a poem or two and old Rich he's crack a joke
But damn it nearly make you cry when John Ed sang "Cowpoke"

Someday this road I travel, Lord I will leave behind
But memories of the things I've seen will never leave my mind
On a quiet summer's evening when the sun is sinking low
I'll think again of days gone by when John Ed sang "Cowpoke"
