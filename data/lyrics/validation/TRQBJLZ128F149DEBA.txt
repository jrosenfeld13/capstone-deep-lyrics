Somewhere
Nowhere
I`m stuck in between
Daylight
Moonlight fades
Madness
And sadness
Is all it takes
Don`t lose it
Cause it is yours now
Hear me out
I won`t make it on my own
And stand by my side
All those years
Have so much more to come
Talk to myself
I am sane but I fake it
And nowhere is somewhere
But nobody makes it
And talk to myself
I am sane but I fake it
And nowhere is somewhere
But nobody makes it now
Makes it home again
Makes it now
Makes it home again
Hear me out
I won`t make it on my own
And stand by my side
All those years
Have so much more to come [2x]
