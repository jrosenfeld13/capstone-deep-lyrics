[Verse 1]
Take me down six underground
The ground beneath your feet
Laid out low, nothing to go
Nowhere a way to meet

[Chorus 1]
I've got a head full of drought down here
So far off losing out round here
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

[Verse 2]
Calm me down, bring it 'round
Too way high off your street
I can see like nothing else
In me you're better than I wanna be

[Chorus 2]
Don't think 'cause I understand I care
Don't think 'cause I'm talking we're friends
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

[Verse 3]
Talk me down, safe and sound
Too strung up to sleep
Wear me out, scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap

[Chorus 3]
I fake my life like I've lived too much
I take whatever you're given, not enough
Overground, watch this space
I'm open
I fake my life like I've lived too much
I take whatever you're given, not enough
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace
