The spaces between all the times
Is where I lay my sweet heart down

The spaces between
Her cruelest insults
Is where I stopped being faithful

The gap between fat Kelly's teeth
Distracts my eyes from her body

And as she pulls me to the floor
I don't feel that guilty

My trousers around my knees
And her skirt above her waist

But in the cold sober light
She's not nearly so pretty

But if I drink more gin
Her grace might return

My sweet heart don't know
And I sure won't tell her

That fat Kelly's teeth
Have bitten chunks off of me

And what was I thinking of
When I went home with her

She had sympathy
She had cigarettes
Now they've all disappeared

Between her teeth
Between her teeth
They've all disappeared
Between her teeth

And I always forget
How quick the sun sets

And now that the rock sets
I'm must go home

I don't feel regretful
I don't feel ungrateful

Even though I'm unfaithful
I don't feel that bad

But in the cold sober light
She's not nearly so pretty

But if I drink more gin
Her grace might return

My sweetheart don't know
And I sure won't tell her

That fat Kelly's teeth
Have bitten chunks off of me

And what was I thinking of
When I went home with her

She had sympathy
She had cigarettes

Now they've all disappeared

Between her teeth
Between her teeth
They've all disappeared
Between her teeth

They've all disappeared
Between her teeth

They've all disappeared
Between her teeth
