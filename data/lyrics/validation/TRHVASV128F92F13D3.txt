Don't believe all those lies
Darlin', just believe your eyes and

Look, look, my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Look, look, my heart is an open book
My love is honest and true
(Doodidit, doodidit, doodidit, doot)

Some jealous so and so (Doodidit, doot)
Wants us to part (Doodidit, doodidit, doodidit, doot)
That's why he's tellin' you (Doodidit, doot)
That I've got a cheatin' heart

Darlin', just believe your eyes and

Look, look, my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you
