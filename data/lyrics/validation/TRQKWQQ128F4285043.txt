Hey baby they're playin' our song
The one we used to hear when we used to get along
Hey baby they're playin' our song
Let's get back together that's where we belong
It's the one with the pretty melody
It's the one that made you fall in love with me
It made us feel so groovy
We fell in love, just like in the movies

Hey baby they're playin' our song
The one they used to play when we used to get along
Hey baby they're playin' our song
Let's get back together that's where we belong
Pleasant memories are comin' back to me

Can't you remember the way it used to be

It made us feel like dancin'
It gave us time to think about romancin'

(hey, baby, hey, baby)

Hey, baby, hey, baby They're playin' our song (repeat to fade)
