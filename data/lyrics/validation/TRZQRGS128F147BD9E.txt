Mom and Dad
Living in Michigan with Uncle Ray
He and Aunt Terry said I should write
Said I should write
I should phone you
Just dont have that much to say
See Ive been bartending about three nights a week
A stand-up place and theyre good to me
Still I stay bored, most all the time
Cept for the cards that Ray and I play
He's the only friend ive got in this place
Still it's better than Wichita
Aunt Terry, shes fine
She wants you to know she wrote a song
She's picking up where she left off
She's picking it back
And its been years since shes tried
God has it really been that long?
Mom I'm sorry I was wrong
Dad I'm sorry I just couldnt stay in that town
Where everyone knows everything about me
Michigan, shes alright
Still I havent found a love
Just want to be happy
Love, your son
Just try to be happy
Love, your son
