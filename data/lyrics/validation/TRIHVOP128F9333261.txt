Last Friday evenin', I went to dry heavin'
Bent over double in pain
From out of my mouth, and right on a new Lexus
A hell of a load I sure swang
On my knees I was throwin', the owner was goin'
Inside to pay for his gasoline
I'm in a mess at the Texaco, barfin' up refried beans

I'm down at the Texaco, sick as a dog
My stomach's churnin'; my tail end is raw
I swear it's the last time I'll eat another taco supreme
I'm in a mess at the Texaco, barfin' up refried beans

No this picture ain't purdy, I ate number 30
And drank too much Mexican beer
Four shots of tequila don't mix with fajitas
I'm prayin' a bathroom is near
I OD'd on tamales and green guacamole
Lord, I hope that the toilet is clean
I'm in a mess at the Texaco, barfin' up refried beans

I'm down at the Texaco, smell like a hog
Knee deep in poo-poo; the commode was clogged
Who used it the last time? Ooo, boy did it stink
Shoo-ee at the Texaco 'cause of them refried beans

I'm down at the Texaco, where's Tim McGraw?
While I'm sittin here peelin' the paint off the walls
He's probably sippin fine wine and dining on fancy cuisine
While I'm here at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans
(Ugh)
A mess at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans

"I said I'd be out in a minute!
There... excuse me."
