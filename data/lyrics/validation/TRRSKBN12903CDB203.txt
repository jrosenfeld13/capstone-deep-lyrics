Smell the taste and feel the sky
Controlled by lust you can't defy

Beyond these skies, lies the world
That we once knewe and passed all through
A dying world, filled with hate
A world that we all devastate

There... On the other side, there are laws which they do not
Follow
Here... On the other side, I am the only God I know

Now your time has come to die, now it's time to say goodbye

Life ends... Blown into oblivion

Seek the light and pass away, show your soul another day

Here exists no hatred, here exists no love
Here exists no prayers, to some God above!

My last word will be short. Heading for my mind's resort
The final sound a smell to see. Pieces of what's eant to be

Here... On the other side, I am the one I am the godly
There... On the other side, a world is drowned in flames

Now your time has come to die, and there is no reason why!

Vacant graves. Now refilled, nothing left of what we built

You can't live forever, but can you be dead forever???

NO!!! The salvation to our planet was to blow it all away
I saw the people pray, so this is the beginning
(From) the beginning to the end, now there's no world to de-
Fend

Seek the light and pass away, show your soul another day
