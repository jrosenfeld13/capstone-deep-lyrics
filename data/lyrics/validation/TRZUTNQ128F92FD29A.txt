And the planets move as I touch your back
The stars go out as I tip my hat
Will I kiss those hands as we fade to black
So say us  there will it end

And well fill our ship with the days & years
Our own funeral pyre on a sea of tears
And well watch that light til it disappears
So say us  there will it end

And the trees will grow where we used to lie
And our childrens names will be washed away
But the sky looks down on another day
So say us  there will it end
