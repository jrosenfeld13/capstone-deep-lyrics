Ripped and torn
My temple of flesh I defile
Carnal scorn
Angels mourn as spiritual winds of malice blow

Celestial light will shine on me no more
Let the darkness consume me
Embrace the wisdom of the fallen from grace
I let it guide me
Confront me not with your righteous ways
His sacraments are forgotten
I brand myself in deepest spite
Towards everything that you represent

Mutilate - Self-hate
The soothing of a hungry blade
Misery - So deep
Grant me the eternal sleep

[Chorus]
Released by the blood
Set free trough the pain
A vile coronation of carnal dismay
My body is punished again and again

I've realized there's no purpose to this life
Pointless form of existence
I'll walk the valley of the shadow of death
Take your filthy hand away from me O' "lord"
Your so-called love is not wanted
I'm already dead deep within
So all hail the ultimate sin

Mutilate - Self-hate
The soothing of a hungry blade
Misery - So deep
Grant me the eternal sleep
Suicide - Inspired
Join me on my final ride
Lust for life - Cast aside
Exit with a shotgun smile

[Chorus]
Released by the blood
Set free trough the pain
A vile coronation of carnal dismay
My body is punished again and again
