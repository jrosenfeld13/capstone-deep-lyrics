I met Horatio five years ago
Outside of Munich on the way to Rome
It was 45 degrees and I could barely breathe
He waved and said "Hey, come sit by me"
I was scared at first cos when he spoke it wasn't very soft
He told me about the life long love of his heart
Had a t-shirt on that said 'we're all gonna die alone'
I still believe that's true oh I truly do

I want you to notice
I want you to care
Oh Horatio
Oh Horatio

I want you to notice
I want you to care
Oh Horatio
Please don't go
Please don't go

He was 22 unemployed with a perfect smile
On his way to Paris, no, I never asked why
His English was as bad as mine, but I will
Remember those hours for the rest of my days

I want you to notice
I want you to care
Oh Horatio
Oh Horatio

I want you to notice
I want you to care
Oh Horatio
Please don't go
Please don't go

Oh Horatio

..repeat and fade out
