[Intro:]
"I spent this whole year, doin' my thang, just thinkin' bout me, but that's about to change
Cause this year it's all about you, baby"

[Verse 1:]
I made a lot of promises last year I guess
And though I didn't keep them all, a few I kept
I even made a few decisions that I now regret
And for the New Year, ooh dear, this is gonna be the best one yet
Cause it's all about you this year

[Chorus:]
This year, everything is all about you
This year, you're part of everything I do
This year, if there's anything you want, all you gotta do is ask
This year, you come first, everybody else comes last

[Verse 2:]
There were times when you didn't know where I was at
(so you'd call)
I'd see your number on my cell knowing well I need to holla back
(but I'd stall)
Any other guy would leave if they were treated like that
It was no parade but you stayed, so this year it's a wrap
It's all about you this year

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I didn't mean to diss you babe
Ignore or dismiss you babe
Hear me out and listen babe
This year and more is yours
Cause you deserve better than this no doubt
We got a few minutes til this year runs out
So listen dear, we've she'd our last tear this year

[Repeat Chorus]
