I'm standing on the edge of the cliff
And I'm thinking it through my mind
I'm afraid that I'm about to slip
Because my body is out of time

And I'm thinking, thinking, thinking, think
Thinking till I'm nearly dead
Do you remember when you were young?
Do you remember what your mother said?

She said, don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much

Obsession is a terrible thing
Does it happen to everyone?
As mother nature comes with a sting
And it persecutes everyone

And I'm lying, I'm lying, I'm lying awake
Lying in my burnt out bed
Do you remember when you were young?
Do you remember what your mother said?

She said, don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much

And I think again
And I think again
It's just the thinking I don't understand
It's all holes, built to wires
But persecution is on fire

Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much (repeat to fade)
