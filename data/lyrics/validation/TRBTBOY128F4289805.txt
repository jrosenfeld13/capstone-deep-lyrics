I got a Mojo Box
With your head on top...
I got a Mojo hand
It's more than I can stand...

Well there ain't nothin better for me
To get a little closer to you
I gotta Mojo Box

I gotta do as I say
In an average, soft spray
I think i'll Mojo along
On every thing that I own

Well there ain't nothin better for me
To get a little closer to you
I gotta Mojo Box

I said "Hey Mister Voodoo man
I said how much I hate
Where do I stand
I got to get my baby back
I got to get my baby back
