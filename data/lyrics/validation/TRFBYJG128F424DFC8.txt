[Intro: Betty Wright]
Go ahead Stone, make it do what it do (baby)
Don't be acting cute now 'cause you know
Rolls up a lil something-something
I know you hear the roar of the crowd right now but
The same people you see going up, you see coming down
Say it

[Verse 1: Angie Stone]
Before you got your ends
And your brand new Benz
And your exclusive friends
I was your baby, I was your ride or die
And yes, your one supply
Of everything you needed
There was never room
For either to assume
That you would be leaving
But now that your brand new
And getting on through
Here's something to take with you

[Chorus]
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed hugging
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed loving
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed stroking
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed choking

[Verse 2: Angie Stone]
Now that you're flying high
Head up in the sky
Got everyone believing
You made it by yourself with nobody's help
Who're you deceiving
You already know
You're reaping what you sow
You better take it slow
Boy, let me warn you
While you're making your moves
Something to take with you

[Chorus]
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed hugging
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed loving
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed stroking
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed choking

Slow down, slow down
Tag team, Betty Wright, your turn

[Verse 3: Betty Wright]
Before you lose your mind
You'd better press rewind
And get some understanding
Don't want to waste my time
You see, I works for mine
And life is too demanding
Breaking every rule
Thinking that it's cool
Baby, don't you be no fool
Now that you're brand new and getting on through
Something to take with you

[Chorus]
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed hugging
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed loving
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed stroking
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed choking

[Bridge: Angie Stone]
Yes, I was your girl (you used to love me)
You used to love me (you used to love me)
(Kiss me and hug me)
(You used to love me)
You used to hug me
(Kiss me and hug me)
You used to love me (you used to love me)
Gave you everything
You used to love me
You used to stroke me
Oh, oho, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed hugging
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed love
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed stroking
I was your baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you needed choking

[Outro]
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember, yeah
You needed stroking
Give me what I want
I gave you everything you needed
I love you and I want you, baby
Giving you all my loving and then some
Baby, I didn't get it right for it
I was holding you down like crazy right there
You were in the pocket
I was in the socket
