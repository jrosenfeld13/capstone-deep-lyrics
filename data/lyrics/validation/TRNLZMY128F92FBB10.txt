The flowers are all blooming in the cemetery
Very fertile things are buried
Very fertile things are rising to the surface
And their heads now break the soft new ground
Penetrating icebergs, and their crests are dawning
By her freezings and thawings

The roses that lay in Memoriam Bay
They lay wilted
But look what supple daffodil did
She looks just like a drawing of an areola
In my seventh grade anatomy textbook

And college smells like vomit
'Cause someone puked upon it
In the stairwell last night
Many times
But it's probably gonna be alright

From New England soil new rocks fruit each spring
Her soil cleaves and out she rings
Her soil cleaves and out she brings
Like a once ago
Like a once-swallowed bowling ball
Like a long ago once-swallowed bowling ball

And their heads are brought to the surface
Penetrating icebergs, and their crests are dawning
By her freezings and thawings
By her freezings and thawings
