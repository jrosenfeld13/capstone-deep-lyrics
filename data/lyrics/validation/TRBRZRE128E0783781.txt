[Verse 1]
You must not love to hate
You must not take the bait
And learn to hit delete
You'd say the same thing to me
Rent's high, and the war's on
And it's last call
Even your friends look worried
My friends think you're smart
We think you're super-fine
But it's high time
I mean it's high tide
AKA a fine line, inside

[Chorus]
Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face cause
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess

[Verse 2]
You must not roll your eyes
You should not often lie
How could you ever say
That your friends won't be there
It's a long walk, on a cold night
When you wanna fight
Over some day-old drama
You used to make us laugh
We want the old you back
Cause it's high time
I mean it's high tide
AKA a fine line, inside

[Chorus]
Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face cause
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess

[Outro]
You're a mess, a mess, you're a mess, a mess
You're a mess, a mess, you're a mess, a mess

[Bridge]
This island where we live without A/C
Is the city where we learned about painting
It was the title of the mix-tape you gave me
Not where we're from but the topic of daydreams
Let's take a tour of the bathrooms you cried in
For break-ups, bad lucks, shock of the lost twins

[Verse 3]
The horizon's like a ship in flames tonight
You say you just don't know
If you can take this city, cause the
Rent's high, and the war's on
And it's last call
Even your friends look worried
My friends all think you're smart
We think you're super-fine
But it's high time
I mean it's high tide
AKA a fine line, inside

[Chorus]
Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face cause
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess!
