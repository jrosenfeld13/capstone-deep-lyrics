Lonely sidewalks, silent night
Bring the evening, deep inside
Hold me darling, touch me now
Let the feelings free tonight

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight

Time of season, wipes your tears
No ryhme or reason, no more fears
And all the dreamin', is far behind
You are here now, and everythin's alright

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight

And in the morning I'll be gone away
All the things I left behind
If you need me I'll come night and day
Let's stop the hands of time

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight
