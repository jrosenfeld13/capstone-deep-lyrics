Tampering with the codes to our existense
The blasphemy will take its toll
With blood on their hands
They alter our perception of reality
Morticians clad in white seek their prey

Compassion is left behind
In their search for a controllable mind
Trespassing on sacred realms
Sustaining the dying breed

They will eradicate the features of man's weaknesses
Delete, improve the versions of ourselves
Try to cure us from the disease
We're dethroned and left to bleed
Human nature's shedding skin

Compassion is left behind
In their search for a controllable mind
Trespassing on sacred realms
Sustaining the dying breed

We're all just shedding skin...

Creating but bitter repercussions
We're disarmed of all control
With blood on their hands
They alter our perception of reality
Morticians clad in white seek their prey

Compassion is left behind
In their search for a controllable mind
Trespassing on sacred realms
Sustaining the dying breed
