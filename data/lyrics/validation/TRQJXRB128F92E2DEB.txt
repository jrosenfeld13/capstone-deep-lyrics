Smoking, tripping, drinking, never thinking what's to be
Another day, another war has come to set me free
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinking booze and raising rifles
Hell straight through and through

A never ending rolling nightmare with no end in sight
I start to drink, get high and smashed, it gets me feeling right
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinking booze and raising rifles
Hell straight through and through

Drinking, puking, pissing, and fighting
Starting all over again
Drinking, puking, pissing, and fighting
Starting all over again
Drinking, puking, pissing, and fighting
Starting all over again
Drinking, puking, pissing, and fighting
Starting all over again

Where I fall and where I rise, I couldn't give a damn
Another shot, another beer, is all that I have planned
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinking booze and raising rifles
Hell straight through and through
