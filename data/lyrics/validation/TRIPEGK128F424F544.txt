(Donnie VanZant-Jim Peterik)

I see you sneakin' round with that stash you carry
Looking like a cat that swallowed a canary
You can hide it from the world
You can wear a good disguise
The weight of self deception is right there in your eyes

Little sister can't you see your own good?
The light inside of you is understood
Don't put yourself down for being human now
Don't have to live like someone else

You're Hiding from Yourself
You're running from the one friend that you really need
You're Hiding from yourself baby
You're lying to the one that needs you desperately
Baby you don't have to hide
You can always run to me

I see you with your friends shoutin at the moon
It ain't a party if it's over too soon
You can take it to the edge
You can buy a little time
Or waste you life's emotions in a silent pantomine

Little sister no one understands
You try to numb the pain anyway you can
But now you've seen the rain
And now it's time for change
Look out the sun is breaking through

You're Hiding from Yourself
You're running from one friend that you really need
You're Hiding from yourself baby
You're lying to the one that needs you desperately
Baby you don't have to hide
You can always run to me

There is no reason for your tears
You're like a scared little girl
There is a cure all for your fears
Look to the light of the world

You're Hiding from Yourself
