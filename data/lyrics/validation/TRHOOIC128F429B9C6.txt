You're so damaged but you manage to handle it well
Throw us all against the wall now see if we stick
I've been thinking bout leaving but no one can tell you what to do
Now it's all on you

Oh I bet these lips taste like treason
There is a reason you're still here
It's becoming even clearer by the minute
I bet your kiss tastes like poison
But it keeps all the boys on the street
Oh so interested and weak yeah

And if I ever found the fabric from which you were cut
I would cut it to pieces and slam the door shut it shut it
Keep that line to your self. So you say I wasn't really giving enough
Well that's life and it's tough. But you know it's still on you

Oh I bet these lips taste like treason
There is a reason you're still here
It's becoming even clearer by the minute
I bet your kiss tastes like poison
But it keeps all the boys on the street
Oh so interested and weak yeah

Hey now listen if you see that girl coming
You better hit the ground running away
But I know that if you're more than likely like me
Then you'll try and learn it the hard way

Oh I bet these lips taste like treason
There is a reason you're still here
It's becoming even clearer by the minute
I bet your kiss tastes like poison
But it keeps all the boys on the street
Oh so interested and weak yeah
