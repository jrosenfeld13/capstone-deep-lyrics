I walk the streets by day
I never know what others say
It doesn't matter anyway

Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Who's the man?

For years, I've lived inside my dreams
Somehow, I've made them really seem
I make my own rules because I am

Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Who's the man?

I can put on any face
You won't know me but it's no disgrace
The king of night, he understands

Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Man of a thousand faces
Who's the man?

Who's the man of a thousand faces?
Who's the man of a thousand faces?
Who's the man of a thousand faces?
Who's the man?

I'm the man
I'm the man
I'm the man
I'm the man

I'm the man of a thousand faces
I'm the man of a thousand faces
I'm the man of a thousand faces
I'm the man

I'm the man
I'm the man
I'm the man
