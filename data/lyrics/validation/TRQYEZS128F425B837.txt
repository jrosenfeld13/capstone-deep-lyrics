Off the beaten track here lies this Earth
Forgotten in the battle between death & birth
Other self ignite, ignore the fremesence
Look towards the inner sun and dread suspence

[Chorus:]
Distortion - Control
Our Shadow World
[Repeat]

At the darkest hour
They gain control
Marring our judgement
Slaving our souls

[Chorus:]
No more conquest, no regret
Man's inhumanity - our inner destiny
Bring forth our filth and evolves
Eaten away as we decay - our world is dark
Suffering the wrath of aeons
Harmony cries - Take control! Take control!
But slowly our vision dies - shadow hood the foe
Debased to Anarchy, open up the pit
Spilling a deluge of black
Swallowing the light, crushing all heart
Shadows arise and attack
Violent descendance, regress unto war
Drowning in a stenchland of the shadow law
Succumb to death so slowly find no end to see
Shadow World evolving for eternity

[Chorus:]
No more conquest, no regrets
