Thousands of united states soldiers descended upon the tiny nation of Vietnam
They did not know what lay ahead but selflessly laid down their lives
Fighting on foreign soil we carry out our duty no matter what we see or hear
Question our right to be here reassured by empowered men
That we were acting nobly for the good of the common man
Fighting a war against oppression in a hostile land
Watching as friends lay dead and dying saving who we can
A nation tears itself apart half a world away
Ungrateful for the sacrifices we bore ON THEIR BEHALF
We bled the ground deep red
Died too young embraced our death
You could never see what came of me terrors I fear became reality
Fighting for what we believe in
We do our duty the best that we can
Not knowing what to believe in
Ordered to kill by our own government
Save myself and those who fought beside me
We are the victims of war
We were the victims
Kill to live not live to kill
But what's the difference
We are the victims of war
We were the victims
Victims of wars circumstance
What will become of us now
Our generation is lost
Despised for our service to god and country
We killed ON THEIR BEHALF
We bled the ground deep red
Died too young embraced our death
You could never see what came of me terrors I fear became reality
We won't forget
We must remember the fallen
We must remember the slain
