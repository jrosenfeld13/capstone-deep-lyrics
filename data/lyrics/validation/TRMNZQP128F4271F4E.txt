Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up

Standing at your door just like I done before
You've changed so strange you're all grown up

You wear those heels and hose dressed up in your mama's clothes
You're hip, I'm whipped, your all grown up

When I'm walking talking to ya all the time
Makes me wet all over honey so glad your mine

When you feel my touch by loving you too much
You're right, so nice, you're all grown up

Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up

You threw away those candy bars started gazing at the stars
Brand new that's you you're all grown up

When your lips so fine start closing in on mine
More thrills, more chills you're all grown up

When I'm walking talking to ya all the time
Makes me wet all over honey so glad your mine

When you feel my touch by loving you too much
You're right, so nice, you're all grown up

Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up
