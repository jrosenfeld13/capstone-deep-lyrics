Come on live a little
Broadway
Come on live a little
Broadway

One last stop in the jungle
Leave for the first time
We died in the jungle
At the hands of a man

We're all in the jungle
Couldn't find a way
So come on the jungle
Man to man

When we really don't know this jungle
Which way to jump and dance
Jump in the line
Rock your body in time

Everything is alright
We're going to Broadway
For the first time

We're out of the jungle
Everything is alright
Ohh

Come on live a little
Broadway
Come on live a little
Broadway

We're out of the jungle
We're going to Broadway
Come on boys, come on girls
Let's jump in the line
Rock your body in time

Everything is alright
Let's go to Broadway
