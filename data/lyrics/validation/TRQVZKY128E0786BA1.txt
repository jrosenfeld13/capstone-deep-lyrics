[Verse 1]
Hanging by threads of palest silver
I could have stayed that way forever
Bad blood and ghosts wrapped tight around me
Nothing could ever seem to touch me

[Pre-Chorus]
I lose what I love most
Did you know I was lost until you found me?

[Chorus]
A stroke of luck or a gift from God?
The hand of fate or devil's claws?
From below or saints above?
You came to me
Here comes the cold again
I feel it closing in
It's falling down and all around me
Falling

[Verse 2]
You say that you'll be there to catch me
Or will you only try to trap me?

[Pre-Chorus]
These are the rules I make
Our chains were meant to break, you'll never change me

[Chorus]
Here comes the cold again
I feel it closing in
You're falling down and all around me
Falling
Stroke of luck or a gift from God?
Hand of fate or devil's claws?
From below or saints above?
You come to me now

[Bridge]
Don't ask me why
Don't even try

[Chorus]
A stroke of luck or a gift from God?
The hand of fate or devil's claws?
From below or saints above?
You came to me
Here comes the cold again
I feel it closing in
It's falling down and all around me
Falling

[Outro]
Falling, falling
Falling, falling
Falling, falling
