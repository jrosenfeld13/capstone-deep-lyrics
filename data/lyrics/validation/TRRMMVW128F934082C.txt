Folks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest, toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Ho-dee, ho-dee, ho
Ho-dee, ho-dee, ho
Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Hey-dee, hey, hey-dee, hey
Whoah, whoah

She messed around with a bloke named Smokey
She loved him though was cokie
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

Hey-dee, hey-dee, hey
Hey-dee, hey-dee, hey
Oy, yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi
Oy, yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, oh
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, oh
Whoah, whoah

She had a dream about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with the platinum wheel

Hi-dee hi-dee, hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hi-dee hi-dee, hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hey-dee hey-dee, hey-dee hey-dee, hey
Hey-dee hey-dee, hey-dee hey-dee, hey

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Whoah, whoah

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Min
