Take the curtains down
Walk onto the ground
Where they walked before
They never knew anymore

Take the curtains down
Walk onto the ground
Where the garden grew
And everyone knew what life was

Ah I, ah I, now I know what you wanted
'Cause I was wanting something too
And maybe if I read some more
Someday I can walk, walk like you

Pull the covers back
Lay yourself
Down patiently
Dodging history

Pull the covers back
Lay yourself down
Where life began
And it ended then

Ah I, ah I, and now I know what you wanted
'Cause I was wanting something too
And maybe if I read some more
Someday I can walk, walk like you

Maybe, someday I'll find
That I won't be so blind to look up to the sky
And see your face painted in the clouds
See all you left behind

Ah I, ah I, now I know what you wanted
'Cause I was wanting something too
And maybe if I read some more
Someday I can walk, walk like you

Ah I, ah I, now I know what you wanted
'Cause I was wanting something too
And maybe if I read some more
Someday I can walk, walk like you
