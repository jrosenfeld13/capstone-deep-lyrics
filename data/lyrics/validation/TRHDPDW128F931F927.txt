[Verse 1]
(Wayne and Reichner)
Oh, oh, I love you so
Uh, uh, can't let you go
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh, gee, the way you kiss
Sweedee, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I need your love tonight

[Verse 3]
I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some loving and hold you tight
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low

[Outro]
Hey, now, hear what I say
Oh, wow, you better stay
POW, POW, don't run away
I need your love tonight
