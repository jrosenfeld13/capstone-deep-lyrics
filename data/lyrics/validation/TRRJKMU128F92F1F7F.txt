I destroy all in me
That might be understood
As weakness or fault
I condone and embrace
The inescapable
End of it all

There are no words in this world
To make you comprehend
Darkness beyond all senses
Under the black wings I lay myself to rest
And draw a new note of silence

I behold and observe
That in my reflection
There are no scars
I aim to be reborn
And redress my failures by
The destruction of this form
