You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
In the pale moonlight

So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be, you're gonna be
Oh darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know
That the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
And I know
That while we're apart
You won't give your heart
To anyone

So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be, you're gonna be
Oh darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Don't you feel it when we touch?
I will never ever let you go
I love you oh so much

If you dance
If you carry on
'Til the night is gone
'Til it's time to go
And if he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You can tell him no

So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be, you're gonna be
Oh darlin', save the last dance for me

So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be, you're gonna be
Oh darlin', save the last dance for me

Na-na-na-na-na darlin', save the last dance for me
Na-na-na-na-na darlin', save the last dance for me
