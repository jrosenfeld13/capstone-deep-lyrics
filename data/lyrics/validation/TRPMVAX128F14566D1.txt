Nibbling on sponge cake
Watching the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strumming my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginning to boil

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on

Wastin away again in margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that theres a woman to blame
But I know its my own damn fault
Yes and some people claim that theres a woman to blame
And I know its my own damn fault
