Warriors with hate
Comes true, the awful prediction
Still alive, corpses lie in the street
Spitting the blood to the God
Dying in flames, dammed mob
Screaming with pain, this can't be, ohh, God
Maybe, they will understand, he was never
But will be too late, so die, forever
Circling in the sky, the demons, now, descend
To raise their slaughter of mankind, till its end
The final massacre of people on the earth
Pain, cracks their minds, everywhere is death
False Gods in their temples, tremble with fear
They know the death is now, so near
Unearthly Armageddon, burns with flames of doom
Poisoned seed, flung into virgin's womb
Circling in the sky, the demons, now, descend
To raise their slaughter of mankind, till its end
The final massacre of people on the earth
Pain, cracks their minds, everywhere is death
Merciless angels fly overhead
It's no time for your imploring pleads
Commit suicide with horror in your eyes
Bleeding with scars, pride, world, now, dies
Warriors with hate
Comes true, the awful prediction
Still alive, corpses lie in the street
Spitting the blood to the God
Dying in flames, dammed mob
Screaming with pain, this can't be, ohh, God
Maybe, they will understand, he was never
But will be too late, so die, forever
Different Armageddon, came true, under our eyes
Dust comes down, when the time came for sunrise
The final massacre, winds destroy the earth
Impaled heads notify, that winner is the death
