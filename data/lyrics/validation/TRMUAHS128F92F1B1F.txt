Verybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
I'm just an ordinary man
With ordinary plans
I'm just an ordinary man
With ordinary plans
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
I had a dream last night
That I was a rich man
But when I woke up this morning
I found out I was a poor man
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams

I dreamt I was the president
Living in a tent
But when I woke up this morning
I was thrown out for not paying the rent
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams

No mama, no papa, and I live in the ghetto
I'm just a child from a broken home
