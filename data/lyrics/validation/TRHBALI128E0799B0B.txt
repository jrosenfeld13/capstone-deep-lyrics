Think i've heard it all before
You keep knocking on heaven's door
On the road to a looming night
You explore the madden clouds
For all the reasons that i can't tell
The road to heavens and the road to hell

So wrap your finger around the world
And treat it like you've found a hidden pearl

Feel free (just be what you wanna be)
Be young (feel free, you've gotta be)
Be happy (be happy as you wanna be)
Live long (live, long as you wanna live)
Feel free (just be what you wanna be)
Be young (feel free, you've gotta be)
Be happy (be happy as you wanna be)
Live long (live, live, long as you wanna live)

Been to a wishing well
Hoping for what time can't tell
For all that you can't find
Were they meant to be left behind?

So wrap your fingers around the world
And treat it like you've found a hidden pearl

Feel free (just be what you wanna be)
Be young (feel free, you've gotta be)
Be happy (be happy as you wanna be)
Live long (live, long as you wanna live)
Feel free (just be what you wanna be)
Be young (feel free, you've gotta be)
Be happy (be happy as you wanna be)
Live long (live, live, long as you wanna live)

Be the star:
You want to shine on
Walk through the darkness
Be strong
In the light of oneness
Live on
You belong
You are strong
Be the star:
You want to shine on

Feel free (just be what you wanna be)
Be young (feel free, you've gotta be)
