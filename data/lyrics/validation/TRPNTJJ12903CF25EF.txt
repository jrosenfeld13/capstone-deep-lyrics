Welcome to the apocalypse
The rain falls into the deepest chasm of despair
Despair
He opened his arms and she turned away
Rain fell because it didn't have to be this way
Falling down. Don't see the end
I'm falling down. Don't see the end
All we have is time
It's time to let go

We the people of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union
Establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense
Promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessing of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity
Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America
