I hear the rustle of the fallen leaves
Running through the autumn hills
And my heart is racing faster than the wind
I feel the beauty of it all
But still sometimes I'm overwhelmed
I seem so small, my breath is fading in the cold
Now the evening sun is laying on the land
It covers all of me with gold
My shadow's long and flowing in front of me
I feel like I can touch the world as far as I can see
Silhouette, silhouette
Oh, I've been thinking
Silhouette, silhouette
Now I'm believing
Silhouette, silhouette
With my father shining down on me
I'll reach farther than my dreams
I stand before the world, on an open stage
Sometimes I feel so lost and small
Now a beam of colored light
Washes over me
I see my reaching shadow fall
So many times I'm worried over what to say
But if I'm standing in His light
He will shine the way
Silhouette, silhouette
Oh, I've been thinking
Silhouette, silhouette
Now I'm believing
Silhouette, silhouette
With my father shining down on me
I'll reach farther than my dreams
See the image of a man
On a hill, three crosses stand
His shadow covers all the land
Oh, I've been thinking
Silhouette, silhouette
Now I'm believing
Silhouette, silhouette
Oh, I've been thinking
Silhouette, silhouette
Now I'm believing
Silhouette, silhouette
I see love shining
Silhouette, silhouette
Oh, see love shine on
