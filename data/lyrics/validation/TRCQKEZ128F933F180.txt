No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling only lies
But my dreams, they are as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengence
That's never free
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like i do
And i blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woes
Can shoot through
But my dreams, they are as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengence
That's never free
When my fist clenches crack it open
Before i use it and lose my mind
If i smile tell me some bad news
Before i laugh and act like a fool
And if i swollow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if i shiver won't you give me a blanket
Keep me warm and let me wear your coat
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
