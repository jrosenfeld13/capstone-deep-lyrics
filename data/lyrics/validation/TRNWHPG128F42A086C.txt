[Verse 1]
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Cant forget the things you never said
On days like these gets me thinking

[Chorus 1]
When chickens get a taste of your meat
Chickens get a taste of your meat, yes

[Verse 2]
You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond
He likes killing you after youre dead
You think Im a queer, I think youre a queer
Said I think youre a queer, I think youre a queer

[Chorus 2]
And I shaved every place where youve been
I said, I shaved every place where you been, yes

[Bridge 1]
God knows I know Ive thrown away
Those graces
God knows I know Ive thrown away
Those graces
God knows I know Ive thrown away
Those graces

[Bridge 2]
The Belle of New Orleans
Tried to show me once how to tango
Wrapped around your feet
Wrapped around like good little roses

[Verse 3]
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Now, now, now youve cut out the flute
From the throat of the loon
At least when you cry now, he cant even hear you

[Chorus 3]
When chickens get a taste of your meat
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
When he suck you deep, yes
Sometimes youre nothing but meat
