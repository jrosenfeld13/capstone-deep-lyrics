Have the blues 'fore sunrise, tears standing in my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes
Said the miserable feeling
A feeling I do despise

Seem like everybody, everybody's down on me
Seem like everybody, everybody's down on me
I'm gon' change my way of living
Head my trouble in the deep blue sea

Well, I love my baby but my baby won't be here
Well, I love my baby but my baby won't be here
I'm above hard chewed and pissed off
I'm gon' put her down in her grave

And in a mean old world you're living all by yourself
And in a mean old world you're living all by yourself
If I can't get you
I'ma get somebody dead
