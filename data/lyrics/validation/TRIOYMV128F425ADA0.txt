If I try to take you
There, would you come
With me?
The reason flies, the
Fear is scare, the
Ocean loves the sea
If I try to take you
There, would you come
With me?
The reason flies, the
Fear is scare, the
Ocean loves the sea
Rhythm is love
Heaven is just another world
For the feelin called
Musical
Color is lust
Because all of the sexual "thangs"
We do
In my mind
I trust you make em all colorful
Chorus
I'd like to put you
In such a romance
Take you down
To Paris, France
Leave the caf and the bars
Walk the wintry boulevards
Is that a smile I see ?
Well, maybe your not even
Looking at me
Cuz if you smile for no reason
The season is lost
But if your love is the rhythm
Ma rhythm is love
Chorus
Ma rhythm is love
Coming at you
Just like this!
