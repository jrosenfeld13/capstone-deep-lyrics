[Verse 1]
I've got a call to-daya-aya-aya
Knowing that this girl will come my way
Today-ay-aya-aya-aya
All my life I hope and pray
For just one night with you, oh girl
You know the deal (ha)
You know I'm for real

[Chorus]
Who do you think of when you're lonely?
Is it me you're thinking of (most definitely) when you're lonely?
I get lonely lonely lonely, lonely
Lonely lonely lonely, lonely

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've been watching you, ay, from your window
I know you saw me smoking on my Indo
Waiting for grandma to leave and aunt Lindo
To get so close just to show how my loving go (haa)
So smooth, yo, you thought it was a free flo'
I know you always think that X was a friend-O
Now you know, girl just let me know
Gon' let me know

[Chorus]
Who do you think of when you're lonely?
Is it me you're thinking of (I thought you already know that) when you're lonely?
I get lonely lonely lonely, lonely
Lonely lonely lonely , lonely

[Verse 1]
I've got a call to-daya-aya-aya
Knowing that this girl will come my way
Today-ay-aya-aya-aya
All my life I hope and pray
For just one night with you, oh girl
You know the deal (ha)
You know I'm for real

[Chorus]
Who do you think of when you're lonely?
Is it me you're thinking of (most definitely) when you're lonely?
I get lonely lonely lonely, lonely
Lonely lonely lonely, lonely (woah)

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've been watching you, ay, from your window
I know you saw me smoking on my Indo
Waiting for grandma to leave and aunt Lindo
To get so close just to show how my loving go
So smooth, yo, you thought it was a free flo'
I know you always think that X was a friend-O
Now you know, pretty girl just let me know

[Chorus]
Who do you think of when you're lonely?
Is it me you're thinking of (woah) when you're lonely?
I get lonely lonely lonely, so lonely
Lonely lonely lonely, lonely (whoa)

[Outro]
Lovely, lonely lady
Lovely, lonely baby
