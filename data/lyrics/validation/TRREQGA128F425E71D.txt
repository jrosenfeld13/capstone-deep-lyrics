I look kinda tired, baby
I'm kinda worn
But there's something
Burning deep in my veins

I ain't no star, baby
I ain't no prize
But I see another
Lonely night in your eyes

You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
If you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight

I ain't special, baby
I'm just a man
Who don't look quite
As good as I used to

I been around, baby
I understand
You can see by my face
All the wars that
I been through

You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
If you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight

Don't have much, baby
Here's all I got and even
That ain't gonna last forever

I ain't trying to
Be something I'm not
I just wanna spend
The night together

You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
If you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight

You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
If you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
