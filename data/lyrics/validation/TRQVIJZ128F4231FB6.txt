The sweetest songs, fade to echoes in the wind
The best of times must end, so a new day can begin
And the dreams we dream that seem so real at night
Must meet the morning light, and vanish from our sight

It's just goodbye
Remember, time was never our friend
We walked the road together, we came to the end
It's just goodbye
Now I won't tell you not to cry
But I swear that what we had won't die
Cause it isn't over, it's just goodbye

I close my eyes, and I still can see your face
I know the truth of us, can't be bound by time or space
And the joy we shared, the magic that we've known
Is something that we own, though we may be alone

It's just goodbye
Remember, time was never our friend
We walked the road together, we came to the end
It's just goodbye
Now I won't tell you not to cry
But I swear that what we had won't die
Cause it isn't over, it's just goodbye

It's just goodbye
It doesn't really matter why
I know what we had, can never die
Cause I'll always love you
Yes I'll always love you, so it's just goodbye
