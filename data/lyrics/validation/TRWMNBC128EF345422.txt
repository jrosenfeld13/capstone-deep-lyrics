Elementary eavesdropper
There are things you cannot comprehend
Did you want a kiss
Did you want a flower in your fist?
Or was it all just make pretend?

I'll follow you until the end
I'll follow

Burning down your home, Burning down
Just to rebuild it again, Burning down
I will never steal from you, Burning down
Or any of your friends, Burning down

Adolescent eavesdropper
There are things you wish you could forget
So you start to weep and
You start to drink yourself to sleep
And you only kiss your cigarette

But don't we all feel sick to death
Or do we?

Burning down your home, Burning down
Just to rebuild it again, Burning down
I'll never steal from you, Burning down
Or any of your friends, Burning down

You shower me with gifts
They don't fix it, no
I'm no purchase bastard
Fuck you, tell me right now

If you find me on the offensive
For the first time help out
Tell me right now
Are you happy and How can you be?
Are you happy With me?

You're an adult eavesdropper
And by now the roles have been reversed
And you inflict the shit
You hated as a kid
There is only one way to break this curse

Burning down your home, Burning down
Just to rebuild build it again, Burning down
I would never steal from your, Burning down
Or any of your friends, burning down
