"D.F.A."
Don't fuck around

[Verse One: John Smith]
We'll start a tidal wave
Right beside your face
Tap you on the shoulder
Ask you if you like the taste
Smash you with a boulder
Medic, ain't no time to waste
You entering your miming phase
I'm bend on bringing silent days
Primal rage
That's the P.R. when I'm engaged
I got to go that means G. Off and mind your way
You play the GAS that's that Gay Ass Shit homie
Won't take it back, we don't play that shit
Listen

[Hook: John Smith]
D.F.A., don't fuck around
Yy and John Smith co-crush your town
Mcenroe on the beat, he scores drums that pound
Break Bread in the house chump so what's up now?
D.F.A., don't fuck around
Yy and John Smith co-crush your town
Mcenroe on the beat, he scores drums that pound
Break Bread in the building chump so what's up now?

[Verse Two: Mcenroe]
B.P.M. counts gone through the roof
That's (bullshit per minute)
So we'll knock your crew flat
The B.B.C. broadcast without no contract
The T.N.T. bombs that explode on contact
It's R&R time cause Rod a religion now
Hold a hardy har at their minds, then we sit 'em down
[?] teens, send 'em to the minor leagues
Assign 'em to K.P. for acting like a wanna be

[John Smith]
They call me Joe
J to the O.E
Trudging through the snow scape with cold feet
With headphones as earmuffs, I'm tryin' to hold heat
What up Yy, long time no see

[Yy]
D.F.A
Shout it out like a P.S.A
They creating something we just made
It ain't shit
We just ain't
Gonna sit and just watch it happen
If you listen to this, it's only fitting
D.B.C.A
Don't Be a Cock About it
We don't need no replay, no need to talk about it
See what we say
Covered up and down it's only right
That we're gettin' too nice to fuck around

[Mcenroe]
It's the P
To the motherfuckin' C homeboy
And if we ain't "peace" then you'll see no joy
Used to be TABS but it's been dissolved
Now P.L.S.'s bags and it's winner take all

[John Smith]
It's T.C.B
We Take Care of Biz
Releases beefs on the air and gigs
You see us on the streets, we build with kids
In the inner city, just trying to live legit

[Mcenroe]
It's the ace of the staff, keep my E.R.A. low
Pro, bound to spell it out fast like K-Solo
The T.T.G
With the H.H.W
Plus double F knock the Bread out from under you
Straight hip hop, not the neo-soul
It takes what I got to be the CEO
It's real rap, not an apparel show
So go back to listening to Sheryl Crowe

[Hook]
