If someone you'd give your life for
Walks out on you
And you feel you have no one
No one else to turn to

Open up your heart
Stretch out your arms

(chorus)
Remember somebody else somewhere
Somebody, somewhere
Remember somebody else somewhere
Needs you right now
They need you right now

If ever a pain in your heart
Top40db: The most accurate lyrics site on the net
Makes you feel like crying
If at night, you just can't sleep
Cause you can't stop crying

Heartache seems too more to bear
Your eyes just won't stay dry

(chorus)
Remember somebody else somewhere
Somebody, somewhere
Remember somebody else somewhere
Needs you right now
They need you right now

Oh, my, my, my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't worry bout the past
Hold your head up high
You're gonna see a golden
Rainbow way up in the sky

Turn back the clock
Open up your heart
You'll hear a knock

(chorus)
Oh, baby, I need you
Listen, in my arms
Is where you belong
I need you right now

I'll never, never, never
Leave you, no, no
I need you right now

Baby, oh, baby
Sweet baby, I need you
Yes, I do, I need you
