[Verse 1]
I knew I should have savored every moment
I wish I would have grabbed it tight and just held it
And I know, I know everything's wrong
I let go, let go, and now I'm gone

[Chorus]
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know, you know
You can't get out

[Verse 2]
I knew I should have cherished every second
I step back, I step back into another perspective
And in my mind, my mind I know I've been wrong
It's a feeling you get, a feeling so cold

[Chorus]
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out

[Bridge]
I don't want to feel like this will never be over
And I don't want to sit and think about what's going wrong
And I don't want to feel like this will never be over
'Cause it feels like I've been falling for so damn long

[Chorus]
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know, you know
You can get out

[Outro]
(When it all falls down)
Will never be over
(And you know there's no way that you can get out)
Will never be over
I don't want to feel like this will never be over
When it all falls down
