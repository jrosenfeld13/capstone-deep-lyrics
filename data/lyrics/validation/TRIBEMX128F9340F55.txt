Just let me be the judge
Of what you've done and if I find
You guilty I'll erase you
From my heart and from my mind

Talk is goin' over town
That you my love
Have let me down
I don't believe what people say

I still love you
I don't believe that you're to blame
I don't believe you've brought me shame
I just can't believe that you have been untrue

They say I should go on alone
That you've done something very wrong
That you're not worthy of the love I have for you
But I won't believe a thing they say until you say it's true

Just let me be the judge
Of what you've done and if I find
You guilty I'd erase you
From my heart and from my mind

--- Instrumental ---

You tell me that the things they say
Are true that I should go my way
You ask me to forgive you
For the wrong you've done

You say although you've been untrue
I still mean everything to you
That you only meant to dance
With him and have some fun

Then the jukebox played our favorite song
You knew that you were doing wrong
You closed your eyes and made believe that I was there
And now you think it's better that we'll end our love affair

Just let me be the judge
Of what you've done and if I find
You guilty I'd erase you
From my heart and from my mind...
