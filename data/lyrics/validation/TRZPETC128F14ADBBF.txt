Make me
Take me
Break me
I am pierced
Make me
Take me
Break me
I am pierced

Though I am wounded
And unworthy
I am selfish and untrue
But You are holy
You're the healer
You forgave me
And made me new
You made me new

Make me
Take me
Break me
I am pierced
Make me
Take me
Break me
I am pierced

Oh this love how can it be
That my God would die for me
For my sins His wounds did bleed
Jesus you were pierced for me

Make me(make me, Lord Jesus)
Take me(take me, Lord Jesus)
Break me(break me, Lord Jesus)
I am pierced(oh, oh, oh)
Make me (make me, Lord Jesus)
Take me(take me, Lord Jesus)
Break me(break me, Lord Jesus)
I am pierced(oh, oh, oh)
