If you're a long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone
Somethin' just ain't right

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

Well, long way from home and
Can't sleep at all
You know another mule
Is kickin' in your stall

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

You better catch him
'Cause somethin' wrong
In your home

Well, if you call her on the telephone
And she answers awful slow
Grab the first train smokin'
If you have to hobo

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

If you make it to your house
Knock on the front door
Run 'round to the back
You'll catch him just before he go

That's evil, evil is goin' on
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home
