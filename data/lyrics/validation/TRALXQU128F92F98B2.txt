How happy is the human soul?
Not enslaved by dull control
Left to dream and roam and play
Shed the guilt of former days
Walking on the foggy shore
Watch the waves come rolling home
Through the veil of pale moonlight
My shadow stretches on its hand

[Chorus]
And so we lay
We lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding day
And so we lay
We lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding day

Floating in the endless blue
My seed of doubt I leave to you
Let it wither on the ground
Treat it like a plague you found
All my dreams that were outside
In living colour now alive

And all the lighthouses
Their beams converge
To guide me home

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
