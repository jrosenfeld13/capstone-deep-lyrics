I woke from a dream last night and
No one was there
And as I wiped the filth from eyes
I swear I was able to care!
He woke with a scream
It was only a dream
And where has gone
My reality?
It's not there...
Everyone was pointing and laughing
At a tiny hole in the wall
And it seemed that everyone was demanding
That there is where I should crawl
He woke with a scream
It was only a dream
And where has gone
My reality?
It's not there...
