Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away

I wonder this time where he's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

Well I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
Ah, I know, I know, I know

I would leave that man alone
But ain't no sunshine when he's gone

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
That ain't no sunshine when that man has gone away
When he's gone sunshine when he's gone
When my baby's gone away...
