Through the mist my ship has sailed, leaving me behind
All things left unsaid, that were in my mind
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore

Sandy hills all around, nothing standing clear
Softly light is falling through, time was never here
When I stood on this deck, stranges things I saw
I'm standing on the shore

Headlands fading out of sight, horizons disappear
Hazy shores and silent seas, nothing so I fear
Air and water, grass and sand, merging into one
In the silence of the mist, I am still alone
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore
Standing on the shore
