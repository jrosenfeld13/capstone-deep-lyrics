So you want my affection
We both know you'll only throw it away
But if you must have a go, fine, okay
If you must have a go, then go away

I'm making eyes at you
I've been making these eyes now, making these eyes since '82
I've been making them green and grey and brown and delta blues
I'm reciting a mantra but I can't tell you cos you're missing to me
That's all you'll ever be

Oh please don't, please don't speak
You'll kill the mystique
Oh baby let's not, let's not dance
We'll ruin our chances
Oh, in between the drinks
I can't help but think that
Even as we speak
We kill the mystique

You are missing to me
And I am missing much
Your sleepy panda eyes, those dangerous thighs, your dirty touch
You are the wildest one
But you're the one that I want
I'm making eyes at you
That's all I ever do

Oh please don't, please don't speak
You'll kill the mystique
Oh baby let's not, let's not dance
We'll ruin our chances
Oh, in between the drinks
I can't help but think that
Even as we speak
We kill the mystique

So you want my affection
We both know you'll only throw it away
But if you must have a go, fine, okay
I said, if you must have a go, then go away

Oh please don't, please don't speak
You'll kill the mystique
Oh baby let's not, let's not dance
We'll ruin our chances
Oh, in between the drinks
I can't help but think that
Even as we speak
We kill the mystique

Ba da ba da ba
Ba da ba da ba
