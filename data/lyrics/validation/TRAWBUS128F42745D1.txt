Here is a tale about a boy and girl
And how they found their life's desire

Mariandl-andl-andl, my Mariandl-andl-andl
Beneath your gay chalet my serenade I'll sing
My mariandl-andl-andl, my darling Mariandl-andl
You make me sing just like a skylark in the spring

I'm dreaming of that happy day

When you can pick a mountain rose for my bouquet

My Mariandl-andl-andl, I'm going to marry Mariandl
And in the valley all the wedding bells will play

We're dreaming of that happy, happy day
When all the wedding bells will play

And I will Marry Mariandl, my Mariandl-andl-andl

Beneath your gay chalet my serenade I'll sing

My Mariandl-andl-andl, my darling Mariandl-andl

You made me sing just like a skylark in the spring

I'm dreaming of that happy day
When you can pick a mountain rose for my bouquet

My mariandl-andl-andl, I'm going to marry Mariandl
And in the valley all the wedding bells will play

You will be mine

For evermore

We'll build a home where there'll be room for three or more
