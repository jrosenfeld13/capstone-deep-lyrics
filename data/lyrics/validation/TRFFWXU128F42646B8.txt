And the day came when the slaves would be masters, and the masters would be slaves

Victoria
Another cup of tea
Half a world away
I'm dying
Victoria
Empress and queen
You make the rules
I'm buying
V is for victory
V is for victoria

Onto the ship
I will set sail
All around the world
All around the world

Do your drugs and railroad tracks
Dig your trench
Say it now

Victoria
I'm American, hahaha
Victoria
Without your love
I'll surely die
I will die
I'll dig my Chinese ditch
The king is dead
God save the queen
Victoria
