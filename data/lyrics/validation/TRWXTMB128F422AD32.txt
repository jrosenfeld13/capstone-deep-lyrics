How long have you been guarded
In frameworks to present you?
I need you as a target
My hollow arms defend you
My thoughts were never sleeping
You've got to triple-heal me
Immune against the others

Moving slow to feel me
You punish me with absence
All images inverted
You could be here to hear me
While every word is deserted
How long have you been guarded
In frameworks to present you?
I need you as a target
My hollow arms defend you
You could have taught me how to fight
To be upfront and say the truth
To overcome a lonely youth
To integrate and not to hide
To cogitate and redefine
The heroes I had trusted once
And idolized like setting suns
Surrendering to their fading shine

Spotlight on my swaying
Let me freeze let me burn
Quiet I'll be quiet
Howl me down howl me down
