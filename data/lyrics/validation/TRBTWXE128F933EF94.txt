Say you to me
You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searching the land
For a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

All underneath
I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearing me apart
Right from the very start
And now I see
That it don't take a trick of the light to excite me
So strong, so long
You'll see

Hold on
To what you've
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you've
Been given lately
Hold on
Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Simplicity
A heart of gold, an old head, and young shoulders
Quiet and lovely
Becoming part of me
And now I see
From a handful of names and a thousand faces
One light, burning, furiously

I was tired of January
I was tired of June
I felt a change a-coming
Oh... I was tired of January
Tired of June
I felt a change a-coming, oh
I felt a change a-coming
I felt a change a-coming
Felt a change a-coming soon

Hold on (hold on)
To what you've (to what you)
Been given lately (Been given lately)
Hold on (hold on)
To what you (to what you)
Know you got (know you got)
Hold on (hold on)
To what you've (to what you)
Been given lately (been given lately)

Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Hold on (hold on)

Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Oh yeah, well the world will turn if you're ready or not
Oh, yes the world will turn if you're ready or not
