Sature the souls of a virgin land
A nation on its knees by its own naive
Beliefs. Feasting on the flesh of our starving
Whore. Idly looking on as it bites once
More. Fallen sanctuary stripped off. God
Now worship dogs. Where porno mags
Replaces the bible. Who can save us now?
Self-inflicted madness. Run in circles
Come on catch your tail. He's gone hunting
Hunting for humans. Our urban carnivore
Stone! The one who speaks of justice
Rape! The one who cries for freedom. Exit
The dreams of full remorse. Enter the urban
Predator. Exit the dreams of full remorse
Enter the urban predator. Still we want our
Shit to add up
Just don't like what it adds up to
Society's fading foes were first in line &
Last to know
Concede the surplus killing. Clear the
Table now roll the dice. Pass the matches
Join the feast. Utopia in flames. Time is the
Fire in which we burn. Home, depraved and
Tainted from the life we lead. Exit the
Dreams of full remorse. Enter the urban
Predator. Exit the dreams of full remorse
Ravished by the urban predator. Concede
The surplus killing. Clean the table now roll
The dice
Pass the matches, join the feast. Utopia
Alight

Exit the dreams of full remorse
Enter the urban predator
Exit the dreams of full remorse
Ravished by the urban predator
Exit the dreams of full remorse
Enter the urban predator
Enter the urban predator

Ravished
