When you told me you loved me
Did you mean it?
When you told me you loved me
Didn't you mean it?

First you kissed me on the elevator
Then you said you'd see me later
Now I haven't heard from you
And it's obvious we're through
Why'd you have to say
You loved me in that way
And I got that empty feeling
It stays with me each day
It seems to follow me around
While your on the other side of town

*chorus*

All the lies about the situation
Left me wondering in desperation
Now I know that I've been true
But it's not the same for you
Why'd you have to say
You loved me in that way
Now I haven't heard from you
And my hopes are turning blue
And I got that empty feeling
That stays with me each day
It seems to follow me around
While your on the other side of town

*chorus*
