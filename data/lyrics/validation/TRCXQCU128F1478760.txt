Long, black, curly locks
Dressed so fancy, smiles a lot
She's a foxy lady, gonna be my baby
In time if I want her

Freaks by candlelight
In my mind she's dynamite
She's a kinky lady, gonna be my baby
In time if I want her

Ms. Got-The-Body
(Like sweet cold wine)
Ms. Got-The-Body
(Aw, that girl is so fine)

Ms. Got-The-Body
(She's a pretty little sexy lady)
Ms. Got-The-Body for love

On a Friday night
To all the fellows sheer delight
She'll make a clean undertakin' of hearts
I should be makin' her mine and I'm gonna

Others may be found
She's the finest thing around
Love's gonna hit me, she's the one to get me
And her name I'll be callin'

Ms. Got-The-Body
(Aw, the girl's so fine)
Ms. Got-The-Body
(Takes control of my mind)

Ms. Got-The-Body
(She's a pretty little sexy lady)
Ms. Got-The-Body for love

Ms. Got-The-Body
(You know she rocks my soul, y'all)
Ms. Got-The-Body
(First I rocked, then I rolled)

Ms. Got-The-Body
(She's a pretty little sexy lady)
Ms. Got-The-Body for love

Stories tell us
(Stories tell us)
Girls are sugar but sugar and spice
Ain't twice as nice

As the time she puts her lips to mine
She's a freak, candy-sweet
She's gonna give this lovin' to me

You know the kind I'm talkin' about
They're known all over the world
Known from sea to shining sea
Aw, I took the time and made her mine
Now love is so much better, now she's my lady

Ms. Got-The-Body

Ms. Got-The-Body for love
