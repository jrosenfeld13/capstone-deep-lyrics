Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light from now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, faithful friends
Who are dear to us gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together if the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
