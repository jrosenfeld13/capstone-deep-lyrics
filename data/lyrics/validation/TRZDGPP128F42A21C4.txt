Summer UK '93
Controlled substances in hand
Flash photos on location
The final end solution, road block
Cash from chaos received
This sun burns more than you believe
The smell of C.S. gas
Confusion of the mass, cold sweat
Warning out of control
You know we know
Turning your face away
But where to go
Shake it down by any means
You know you've seen this all before
Broken words from loud hailer
Hands raised in the air and no tune
Armed surveillance last dance
Sparks fly at the first glance
Helpless face within the flame
First purge of the new game crass press
Warning out of control
You know we know
Turning your face away
But where to go
Warning out of control
You know we know
Turning your face away
But where to go
