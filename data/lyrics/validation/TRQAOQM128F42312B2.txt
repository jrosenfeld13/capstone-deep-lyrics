Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
You're daddy's rich
And your mother's good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna wake up singin'
You'll spread your wings
You're gonna take off and fly
But until that mornin'
Ain't nothin' in this world gonna hurt you
So hush little baby, hush little baby
Don't you cry no, no, no, no

You're daddy's rich
And your mother's good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
Hush little baby, don't you cry
Hush little baby, don't you cry
Hush little baby, don't you cry
