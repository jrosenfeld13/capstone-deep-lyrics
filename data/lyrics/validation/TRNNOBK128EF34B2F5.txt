I'm a proud motherfucker, Got nothing to prove, We live on the street where you got nothing to lose, A buck too short, Another day is too late, Running the race where they laugh in your face. At night on the streets, But the streets are burning down, Running in circles, Better of dead, Another burning question, Got no answer to give, Trusting yourself, But you know how to live, Burn your bridges, You can bury them all, Hate everything, You throw it away, Burn your bridges, You can bury them all, Hate everything, You fade away. Another burning question, Got no answer to give, Trusting yourself, But you know how to live, Burn your bridges, You can bury them all, Hate everything, You throw it away, Burn your bridges, You can bury them all, Hate everything, You fade away. I'm a proud motherfucker, Got nothing to prove, We live on the street where you got nothing to lose, A buck too short, Another day is too late, Running the race where they laugh in your face
