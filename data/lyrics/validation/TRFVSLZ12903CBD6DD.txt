You know that you can't hide yourself
Behind the mask that you've made
You phoney I've found out so go
And tell someone who really cares
You betrayed our friendship
The life long bond was split at the seems
We were one in the same
Now watch my smile turn into a stare
You betrayed yourself, you betrayed us all
There'snothing left, ruins are all that's left after the fall
You betrayed yourself, you betrayed us all
There'snothing left, ruins are all that's left after the fall
If there's one thing I've learned in this heartless world
You gotta expect the unexpected
All of the lies I couldn't see now i seek retrobution
Like pouring salt on an open wound
My rage burns from within
Trust me
You said these words I can never forget
The fact that I didn't see it coming took me by surprise
Behing your facade you hid your shame well
The memories will make it hard
To live through all of this shame
From the times that were good and even of times of bad
We've through it all now im suffering your final gain
Can you honestly think what you've done
Makes it worh the hell you'll have to face?
Can you honestly think what you've done
Makes it worh the hell you'll have to face?
