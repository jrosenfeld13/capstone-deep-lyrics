What you doing with that stupid little girl?
Stop your fooling, don't you know it's gonna hurt?
When she leaves you, and you gave all you could give
You'll be hurting for the one you should be with

How are you gonna deal with this?
How many times before you slip?
You made a wager with a kiss
Now, you're the new name on her lips
This is the real thing at your door
Big waves breaking on the shore
But are you gonna sink or swim?
Hold on tight, and don't fall in

Hey, what you doing with that stupid little girl?
Stop your fooling, don't you know it's gonna hurt?
When she leaves you, and you gave all you could give
You'll be hurting for the one you should be with

Jesus, save this heart of gold
Take the time to save a soul
Will he bend or will he crack?
Save this yearling from the pack
He's not aware of anything
Sure as Summer follows Spring
Doesn't know where he's coming from
Reaching perfection takes too long

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey what you doing, you've got so much to live for
The world is turning 'til it can't turn anymore
This fire is burning, it will burn forever more
So what you doing with that stupid little girl?
Stop that fooling, 'cause you know it's gonna hurt?
When she leaves you, and you gave all you could give
You'll be hurting for the one you should be with

You'll be hurting
When she leaves you
You'll be hurting
When she leaves you
You'll be hurting
When she leaves you
You'll be hurting
