[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, feel these sweet sensations, yeah
Honey, honey, looks like a superstar, hey hey
She got a promise of lovestruck fascination, ooh
What am I to do? how am I to know who you are?

[Chorus]
When this love foolosophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love, it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

[Verse 2]
She shimmers like a California sunset
Lady lady, glitters but there's no gold
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
I'm so delirious, is she that serious?
Or is she bringing me on? I've been waiting so long

[Chorus]
And this love foolosophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love, it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

[Bridge]
I don't want the world, I want you
Yeah, I don't want the world, I want you
Ooh, I don't want the world, I want you
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

[Chorus]
Love foolosophy is killing
Previous illusions that
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love, it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool (I'm a love fool)
My love, it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool (I'm a love fool)

[Outro]
Feel my love philosophies (I'm a love fool)
Don't you see it's killing me? Oh (I'm a love fool)
Feel my love philosophies, yeah
Don't you see they're killing me? Ah
(I'm a love fool)
