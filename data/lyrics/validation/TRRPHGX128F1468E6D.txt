When the last car hit the wall
Was the guilt still in your head?
In your magic crystal ball
Is the power that made you mad

You can't save yourself, it's a pleasure cruise
You're damned for a million years

There's a viper in your bedroom
Under the sheets is tarantula fuzz
When she bites and she bites for murder
I bleed the Addams Family blood

It's a spell on me that I can't reverse
You're damned for a million years

Cure me or kill me
But don't leave me here for dead again
Cure me or kill me
But don't leave me here for dead again

This is your last happy Christmas
But your worst birthday party
The cyanide in your poison ring
Wouldn't kill my misery



Can't bury me when I'm history
You're damned for a million years

Cure me or kill me
But don't leave me here for dead again
Cure me or kill me
But don't leave me here for dead again

One, two, fuck you!

Cure me or kill me
Don't leave me here for dead again
Cure me or kill me
Don't leave me here for dead again

Cure me or kill me
Don't leave me, don't leave me here for dead again
Cure me or kill me
Don't leave me, don't leave me here for dead again
