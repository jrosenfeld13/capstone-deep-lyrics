[Intro]
Oh yeah wooh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lifes ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace Ive yet to find

[PreChorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If Im not blind why cant I see
That a circle cant fit where a square should be

[Chorus]
Theres a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Cant be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted
Hole hearted

[Verse 2]
This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay keep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Theres a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Cant be filled with the things I do

[Chorus 2]
Theres a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
Id fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted

Yeah
