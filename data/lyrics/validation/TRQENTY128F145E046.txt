I've been asking all the time
Could I be blind
Hey, I'm kinda feeling
That there's just one reason why
Love won't die
Hey, I'm kinda pleading
Stay by my side

Coz I can't eat, can't sleep
You're the only thing I care about
When you smile you're so sweet
If I could tell you
The way I feel

Believe in me, and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees, baby
Please, believe and you'll see
That my life is yours

All the mountains that we climb
Day at a time
I promise you no heartache
Nothing left to hide
Swallow my pride
Guess you're not believing
I'm turning the tide

Coz I can't eat, can't sleep
You're the only thing I care about
When you smile you're so sweet
If I could tell you
The way I feel

Believe in me, and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees, baby
Please, believe and you'll see
That my life is yours

Believe in me, and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees, baby
Believe in me, and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees, baby
Hoping that you will
Believe in me, and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees, baby
Please, believe and you'll see
That I'm down on my knees baby
