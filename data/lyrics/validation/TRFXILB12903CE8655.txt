Take me to a place where i know i belong take away my anger and replace my hate with love find my reason hiding behind my second skin find what is pushing me, it starts from deep within take apart my insides go over all that is wrong take out what is bad, but leave enough to remain strong i won't stop, i will not until the day through these eyes i despise so much hate don't tell me "give it up", walk away push myself to the edge help me find want to find what is inside, why am i alive?
