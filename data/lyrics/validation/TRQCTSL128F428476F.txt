[Instrumental Intro]

Asking for salvation at the stations of the cross
Eternal is my pledge if eternal is thy loss
Back in the days of yore my country summoned me
Enlisted willingly in defense of liberty

[Short Instrumental Break]

Eroding all alone like the mist upon the moss
Eternal is my pledge, an eternal holocaust
They summoned me, honorably, defend the cause
Never repent, away I went to defend the cause
When I was sent away they made a soldier from a boy
Victory will be achieved, lethal weapons to destroy

[Short Instrumental Break]

Killing season has begun
With blood in my eyes, the truth blames the lies
Machine gun
No place to run, killing season

[Short Instrumental Break]

I was taught the art of war

Kill

[Instrumental Break]

Exploding all alone like the blood upon the moss
Eternal is my pledge, an eternal holocaust
They summoned me, honorably, defend the cause
Never repent, away I went to defend the cause
When I was sent away they made a soldier from a boy
Victory will be achieved, lethal weapons to destroy

[Short Instrumental Break]

Killing season has begun
With blood in my eyes, the truth blames the lies
Machine gun
No place to run, killing season

Chosen one, with death on my hands
Killing season
Art of war
Kill on command, killing season
Killing season, killing season
Killing season, killing season

[Instrumental Outro]
