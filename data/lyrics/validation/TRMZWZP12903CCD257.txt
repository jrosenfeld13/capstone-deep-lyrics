I don't wanna stay if we're gonna fight
Let's make up, baby
Can't we set things right?

Stop wasting time
Make up your mind
Can't you feel what I'm feeling now?

Never say never
You know never's such a long, long time
Never, never say never
You might wanna change your mind
Never say never

No, no, no, no
Don't do it
Don't do it, no, no
Never, never say never
'Cause love could change your mind

I said
I need you, baby
You said you had to go
Then you came hanging around my door

You know you hold the key
Just for my heart
If you stay
Love can have a brand new start, baby

Never say never
You know never's such a long, long time
Never, never say never
You might wanna change your mind
Never say never

No, no
Never, never, no, no, no
Don't do it
Don't do it, baby, no, no
Never, never say never
Love could change your mind

Never say never
Oh, never's such a long, long time
Whoa-whoa
Never, never say never

I tell you that love can change your mind
Never say never
No, no, no
No, no, never, no

Don't do it
Don't do it
Don't do it, baby
Never, never say never
You might wanna change your mind, baby

Never say never
Never's such a long, long time
Like forever, baby, no
Never, never say never
You just might wanna change your mind
Never say never

Don't you say it, baby love
Don't do it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Never, never say never
Love could change your mind
