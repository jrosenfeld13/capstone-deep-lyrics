On your mark, get set, now ready, go!

Everybody razzle dazzle
If it's all night long

Now, here's a dance everyone can do
It's the hipsters' dance
And the square cats' too
Won't you take a chance
This is all you do

You just take your baby
Don't you leave that spot
Then you dance like crazy
Give it all you've got
That's the razzle dazzle
If you're ready or not

Let's get together, one, two, and three
Jumping to the center, just you and me
Put your best foot forward
Baby, can't you see?

When you hear them holler
And you ain't nowhere
Honey, you just follow
Cause we're sure not square
That's the razzle dazzle
Well, it's everywhere

Everybody razzle dazzle
If it's all night long

That's the razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle song
