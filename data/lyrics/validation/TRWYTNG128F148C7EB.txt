Sing me a song without any words
I'll pretend you wrote it just for me
Paint me a picture with images blurred
So I can see what I want to see

I want to see you and me
Happy together, singing love songs

Tell me that story again the one that has no ending
And that will be the story of you and me
It never ends it never begins it just keeps on going like it is
And maybe that's the way that it should be

I want to see you and me
Happy together, singing love songs

Get me out of here, oh, get me anyplace away from here
I cannot see just what I want to see
Oh, I rely on you to get me where I'm going to
Anywhere with you is where I want to be

I want to see you and me
Happy together, singing love songs
