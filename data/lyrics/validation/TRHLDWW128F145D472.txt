Sometimes I find that the ghost from behind me won't go
You'd think by this time
You'd be gone from my mind
But it isn't so
Sometimes I hear your voice ringing clear on the radio
Hearing you tell words that I knew so well
Not so long ago

And though it's changed for us all
I know you will always be near
And though you watch from afar
I know where you are
You walk the homeland

I remember that night
Of that year when the tears wouldn't clear my eyes
I'd seen it before
Like a dream I'd ignore
It was no surprise
I tried to pretend that the madness would end and you'd realise
That all that was left was the whisper of death and your children's cries

And though it's changed for us all
I know you will always be near
And though you watch from afar
I know where you are
You walk the homeland

You slipped away like snow in a warm hand
You welcomed that warm hand
You made it too easy
