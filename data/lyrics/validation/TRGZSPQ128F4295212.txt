The world you painted was new
The colors were so alive
Took a lie and made it true
A final touch and then right into the painting you dive

It's ok if you break
You'll see colors again
This is more than you can take
You'll see colors again
It's your life that's at stake
You'll see colors again
Don't you think it's my time, anytime soon

Whenever did it all happen
That one color after another seems to fade
Now the sky is colored with a coalpen
It's all gray despite the effort you made

How do you like your god now
Now that he is you
Does he feel dead somehow
But my dear, where does that leave you?

It's ok if you break
You'll see colors again
This is more than you can take
You'll see colors again
It's your life that's at stake
You'll see colors again
Don't you think it's my time, anytime soon...

It's ok if you break
You'll see colors again
This is more than you can take
You'll see colors again
It's your life that's at stake
You'll see colors again
Don't you think it's my time, anytime soon

What if I let you fly out of here would you still deny? (x5)
