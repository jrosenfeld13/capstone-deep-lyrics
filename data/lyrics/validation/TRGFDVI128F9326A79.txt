Don't lie to summarize
The truth in place of life
Create a world to find
Your love, your love, your love, your love

I want to be above
And beyond the blue to
The river but the lights
Are bright, are bright, are bright, are bright

I meant for something new
To make anything true
Is part of what I do
Never coming back to you

What is it that I said
To bleed and make a pact
Together is apart from then
Then on I will tell you when

Below the salt means less
Than something else I said
Below the salt means less
Than something else I said
Below the salt means less
