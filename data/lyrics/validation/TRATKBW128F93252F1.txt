Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey

[Verse 1: Yungun]
I shoot game like venison and then it's on
Pen words that bring terror on like letterbombs
And when at once they realise there's no competition
Suddenly everyone wanna get along
I don't settle on seventeen, I twist
Persist or desist, it's never been a miss
You ever seen a gift as evergreen as this?
Bredda, read my lips, it doesn't even exist
It's time I said a few words to get my meaning clear
Truth hurts, leave 'em reeling with a bleeding ear
And it ain't even pierced, but they need to hear
The sharp wit, carved tip, the people's spear
White collar, blue collar, if it's you, holla
Who's gonna move on the one and rule-follow?
We'd lose our honour for a few dollars
They're making fools of us, but who's bothered? You?

Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey

[Verse 2: Yungun]
It's out your sight
Two trollops with high heels and open toes
Like two rollocks on the side of a rowing boat
Cause all you've gotta do is get an oar in and pull it
So young man did, bit the bullet
Leng 'em, leng 'em and be off in the AM
Was he saying he thought he was a lot like Salem?
But from what the doctor's saying, not a lot can save him
I guess that's what he got for grazing
On a dirty lawn, but one man's pollution
Is a next man's solution, it gets mad confusing
Who's in charge? They got us like some damn salmon
Swimming upstream until the fisherman grab 'em
Bag 'em and tag 'em in one quick hand action
And fish to dish is such a swift transaction
Badman rapping, riding the bandwagon
Repping, they're maintaining, really them man canning, no ice

[Hook: Yungun]
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey

[Verse 3: Yungun]
Yo, when my thoughts process like Pentium
My mood swing like pendulum, and then I'm in
My own league, I'm an extraordinary gentleman
Write rhymes, press record so they remember them
But then again, what's posterity
When you ain't got prosperity? Not very sweet
Your life is priced, you wanna sell it cheap?
Surprise, surprise, I'm top pedigree
So watch Essa eat your change like parking meters
And when I speak of change, I'm being half-facetious
And partly specious, I take Mastercards and Visas
Cheque, notes, no jokes, and I'm not laughing either
I can't believe you're asking me to start the procedure
That's granting me the chance to leave your heart in seizure
Give you the worst case of party fever
That's when you thought that your carpet cleaner was a Bacard Breezer

[Hook: Yungun]
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Drink liquid and let my mind spray
Spray, spray, hey
