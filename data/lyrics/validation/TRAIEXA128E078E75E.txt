Looked for love in Memphis
Looked for love in Rome
Now that I finally got you
Just wanna take you home

'Cause rushes ain't no fun
But are you breaking the law
Or looking out for a miracle?
I think it's time you tell me where we stand

You been breaking my love
You better start making my love
'Cause I'm in need of a miracle
You been taking my love
You been breaking my love
You better start making my love
'Cause I'm in need of a miracle
