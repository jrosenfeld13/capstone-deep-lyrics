So Jimmy DaLancia breaks his back
Then says it's unbelievable
Why we have to work so hard
And I can't take it anymore
She says that just because it's difficult
It does not mean that we have no choice, oh no
Everything is possible and we say yes to anyone

Potential Futures make a life
Put your hand up and shield your eyes
Potential Futures it's all possible
No one's alone there in the future (x2)

Feeling restrain again breaking down
Your mother had enough of this old town
Jimmy I must leave this place
'Cause I can't take it anymore

Potential Futures make a life
Put your hand up and shield your eyes
Potential Futures it's all possible
No one's alone there in the future (x2)

Maybe all in your mind
Perhaps that we all died, say, years ago
Now what do you have left
Future dreams of passion plays and dancing people
All, so, lonely

Potential Futures make a life
Put your hand up and shield your eyes
Potential Futures it's all possible
No one's alone there in the future (x2)

La laa la la laa
La la la laaa (x4)
