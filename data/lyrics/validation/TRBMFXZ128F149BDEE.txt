Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know, it's the end of the world
If you don't love me nemore

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know, it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
And I can't understand, no I can't understand
Why life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know, its the end of the world
It ended when we said goodbye

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
Cause I can't understand, no I can't understand
Why life goes on the way it does

Tell me why does my heart go on beating?
And why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when we said goodbye...why?
It ended when we said goodbye
