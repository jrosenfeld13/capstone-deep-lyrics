When you were satisfying your thirst for success
And you looked older than I did
I didn't think that that was you at your best
We were only lonely little kids
Amidst stacks and stacks of slacks and black platform shoes
We were little kids
And you could say sorry ten billion times
But sorry didn't do what you did
I threw myself at you and I threw myself away
Amidst stacks and stacks of slacks and black platform shoes

Johnny Cash died today and you say, you say things
Lovely things, to lovely other people
And I'm not invited

But I love the back garden at my parents' place
And I love the view out of my Glasgow window
And I love waking up on the floor of a flat in New York
And you don't know any of these things

And I've seen you selling shoes but you've never heard me sing
And I used to hate your boyfriend and the things you did
Somehow I found out and I was disappointed
But I don't need therapy because I have cigarettes
And I don't have any bad memories only bitter regrets

Johnny Cash died today and I could take a train
And take an hour to think on the way of what I would say when I saw you
And I could walk into the shop and buy myself some black platform shoes;
Talk to all the other girls and just ignore you
Or I could rush into the shop and tell you that I adore you
Because I adore you

Johnny Cash died today and you'd say, you'd say
"It's not like Elvis though is it?"
And you would be right
