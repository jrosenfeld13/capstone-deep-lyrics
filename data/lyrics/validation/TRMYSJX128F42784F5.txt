-Intro-
The sun will set tonight
The sun will set

-Verse-
Its a midnight swim
Where it is late and the air is all clear
And i remember that evening, you on the floor
I was attached to the ceiling

-Prechorus-
Look behind the glass in your mouth
These words i am, due for

-Chorus-
The sun will set tonight under the lonely dreamers
Only to rise again, so we can start it over (we'll start it again)

-Verse-
And you were right
When you whispered in my ear
And it all became so clear
Its going to be alright
Everything will be alright
Even if...even if the city ignites

-Prechorus-
-Chorus-

-Bridge-
Now to get back to
The room where there's windows as large as the city below (x2)

Bring me down, to the safe
Unlock all of me, until then

-Chorus-

-Ending-
The sun will set tonight
