Chewy, chewy, chewy
Always got a mouthful of such sweet things to say
Chewy, chewy, chewy
Chewy's full of sugar and I love her that way

Ooh I love to kiss her
Love to hold her
Love to miss her
Love to scold her
Love to love her like I do
Oh little chewy
Don't know what you're doing to me
But you're doing to me what I want you to

Everytime you love me it's a real sugar treat
Love me little chewy cause you do it so sweet
Ooh I love to kiss her
Love to hold her
Love to miss her
Love to scold her
Love to love her like I do
Oh little chewy

Baby a living box of candy wrapped up so very fine
Do it to me chewy chew me out of my mind
Ooh I love to kiss her
Love to hold her
Love to miss her
Love to scold her
Love to love her like I do
Oh little chewy
Don't know what you're doing to me
But you're doing to me what I want you to
