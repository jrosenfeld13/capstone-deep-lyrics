(Dulli)

My love don't comfort me
She toys with my sincerity
On that i can depend
I've found that nothing's straight
My twisted mind is bent all out of shape
But you will come back
And you will live on
Indeed i know
But you wouldn't lie when i told you to
Had to waste your time and tell the truth
This one is three, this is one is three
Indeed i know
You got me figured out now
Now we're both disappointed
What's done is now undone
Let's cut the line and have the action
In time i will be able to give
