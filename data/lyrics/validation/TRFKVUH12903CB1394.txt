Why didn't you come when I beat my drum
And scream off my head out into the night
Scared of the slums, afraid of the guns
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight

Hey hey hey, na na na na
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight

I was gonna come when I heard your drum
And you screamed your head off into the night
I grew up around different part of town
But even the universes collide

Hey hey hey, na na na na
Even the universes collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Even the universes collide

There was no letter, no family matter
And by the castas we don't divide
It's just father told me tonight authorities
Preparing ethno-cleansing ride

Hey hey hey, na na na na
Preparing ethno-cleansing ride
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Preparing ethno-cleansing ride

Two helicopters with machine guns
Over the slums proudly will glide
So when the universes collide
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side!

Hey hey hey, na na na na
When the universes collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side

Hey hey hey, na na na na
When the universes collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side

Hey hey hey, na na na na
When the universes collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side

Why didn't you come when I beat my drum
And screamed off my head out into the rain
Your mother told you, our father stopped you
Out of the hospitals you are afraid

Hey hey hey, na na na na
When universe will collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Don't get caught on the wrong side

Hey hey hey, na na na na
When universe will collide
Hey hey hey, na na na na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side
