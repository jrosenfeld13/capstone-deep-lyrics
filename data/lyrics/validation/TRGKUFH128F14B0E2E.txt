Sailboats sailin' a crystal sea
Gypsy dolphins runnin' free
Seagulls circling endlessly
Callin' me home
Mocking bird, butterfly
Sunset color filling the sky
Newborn baby starts to cry
Callin' me home

I've been most everywhere
A man can go
I've been this whole world round
Seen most everything
A man can see
One thing I've found
Only thing I ever found

When I was lost and all alone
I took a look on what I'd done
The only love I've ever known
Was callin' me, callin' me
I heard Him callin' me home
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home
