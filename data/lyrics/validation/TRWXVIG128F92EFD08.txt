[Verse 1]
When you're alone, do you think of me?
And my diamond ring's thrown out to sea
And when you love, do you love for me?
Like harmony, a never ending dream
Oh well, oh well. I still hope for the best
Say goodbye send me off with a kiss farewell
And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be
Maybe you could get some sleep tonight
So here's your song. It's twisting me
I'd give anything to make you scream
And I'll just smile, and make believe I don't feel a thing
That doesn't work for me

[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well. Guess I'll see you in hell
There's a pretty little picture that's in my head
And I'm starting to dream, changing colors while I sleep
Maybe I'm just wasting time

[Verse 2]
Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all scream loud
And that was it
I had made it clean just across the street with my new wings
So I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done

[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well
I can't live with myself as I'm climbing in your window to get to your bed
And I'll be what you need
You can call me anything
Just as long as we're still friends

[Verse 3]
Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart, and it's not easy to talk about
So we all sing
When she smiles well it's got nothing to do with me
I'm not the one who sings her to sleep
And I've been talking to God asking for just a little help with you but it's hopeless
It's not the first time but this one really carved it in
And tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over. I wanna see you again. I wanna feel it again
Oh, Oh it's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do
It's over. I wanna see you again. I wanna feel it again

[Outro]
I'll keep you warm safe in my arms. 'Till heaven calls, keep holding on
