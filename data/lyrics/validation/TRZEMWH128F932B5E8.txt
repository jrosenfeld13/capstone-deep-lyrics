First of all must go
Your scent upon my pillow
And then I'll say goodbye
To your whispers in my dreams
And then our lips will part
In my mind and in my heart
'Cause your kiss
Went deeper than my skin
Piece by piece
Is how I'll let go of you
Kiss by kiss
Will leave my mind one at a time
One at a time
First of all must fly
My dreams of you and I
There's no point in holding on to those
And then our ties will break
For your and my own sake
Just remember
This is what you chose
Piece by piece
Is how I'll let go of you
Kiss by kiss
Will leave my mind one at a time
One at a time
I'll shed like skin
Our memories of lazy days
And fade away the shadow of your face
Piece by piece
Is how I'll let go of you
Kiss by kiss
Will leave my mind one at a time
One at a time, one at a time
