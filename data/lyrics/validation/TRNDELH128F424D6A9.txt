Who am I to say the night is kicked? did I decide to side with you I'm tying one more on tonite. this last call has sent us all spilling out onto the streets we jump in cabs we grab our arms and split. you give me eyes to make a move I'm thinking did I ask for you? I have no choice I'm bringing my mistake. Do I have to rely the message I'm okay with this I took my drink and took you in with it. how many blackout nights will we leave sleep far behind and fuck and fight? our bodies never far behind. this light will lead you home when it's all we've got to go on I will go on til I've seen your way back through. we dance with every step. a graceful trance we stalk the streets and sing our songs aloud. so screw em if they shout we're only young as long as it may take to think things out
