Stars would shine on stormy nights
Flowers grew in winter time
Everything seemed possible
When we were in love

When forever was
What other people lost
This lonesome valley was
What other people crossed

No. I couldn't taste
The tears other people shed
When goodbye was
A word other people said

Rivers flowed
A bridge would burn
And nights would end
The earth still turns

Yesterday is just
A song to sing
In the world we knew

When forever was
What other people lost
This lonesome valley was
What other people crossed

No. I couldn't taste
The tears other people shed
When goodbye was
A word other people said

When goodbye was
A word other people said...
