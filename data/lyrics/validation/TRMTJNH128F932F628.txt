We've died a million times
But we are not the walking dead
So fucking far from gone
We jump around and bang our heads

We made our own way
And now we expect some wicked creds
But we will not behave
We stomp the ground and scream instead

Show me, don't tell me
Walk through the fire

We live as we do to show the world what it could be
What's it mean to you?
Is this a vision you can see?
Heroes are those who don't just accept the way things are
Now, which one are you, the driver or the car?
