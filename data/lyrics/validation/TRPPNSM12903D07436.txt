I wondered how to come to You
I did not dare believe it true
That You regard the orphaned ones
They love their daughters or their sons

The broken and the barren too
I heard could find some rest in You
What kind of love in injuries plays
Would leave instead the stain of grace

So I come in sorrow and I come in shame
I come to the cross with my pain

Just as I am without, would one believe
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bids me, come to Thee
Oh, Lamb of God I come, I come

The pardon that I've found from sins
Built out from where the nails went in
My heart will ever won't proclaim
I had not lived until the day, oh, Lamb of God I'm

Lord knows there is a crown for me
The awed and mortal eyes can't see
And idol not to any man
But often mean just as I am

So I come rejoicing with hands held high
And I come singing words of new life

Just as I am without, would one believe
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou beckons me, come to Thee
Oh, Lamb of God, oh, Lamb of God
Oh, Lamb of God, I come, I come, I come
Oh, Lamb of God, oh, Lamb of God I come
Oh, Lamb of God I come
