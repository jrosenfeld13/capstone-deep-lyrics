You've been down for one too many days now
Take my hand and I'll lead you through the tunnel
I know baby that darkness serves a purpose
This been going on for way too long now

I can make an airplane of this phone bill
Watch it crash land right into the basket
Let us steal some properties of rich men
Let's play Robin Hood and Marion now

Come on Marcus you know I love you so much
Joy belongs to you and me and us too
We're not here to watch the others party
You are here to dance with me tonight

The homophobic preacher put his hand
Upon my head and closed his eyes and said:
"Save this Christian ass from being haunted"
The way I felt then is the way you feel now

Come on Marcus you know I love you so much
Joy belongs to you and me and us too
We're not here to watch the others party
I am here to dance with you tonight

And let's break into a church
And dress Jesus in a leather suit
Pierce his fuckin' nostril
And pierce his fuckin' ears too

Come on Marcus you know I love you so much
Joy belongs to you and me and us too
We're not here to watch the others party
You are here to dance with me tonight

Come on baby this day could make some sense now
Joy belongs to you and me and him and her
Let's pretend this is the day we first met
Let's get bound out of obligation
