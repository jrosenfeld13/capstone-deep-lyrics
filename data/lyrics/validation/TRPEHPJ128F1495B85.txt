Destiny cannot be shaken
Fate will send us where we need to be
Many turns our love has taken
But in the end you're standing here with me
Now it's a long road to forever
But together I know we'll find a way

Now we're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin hand in hand
Nothing will break our love
I'll cherish you each day till I die
For all eternity you and I

My heart's filled with such emotion
You're the reason for the air I breathe
I pledge to you all my devotion
Until death do part you away from me
I've never been so close to heaven
As the moment when I looked into your eyes

We're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin hand in hand
Nothing will break our love
I'll cherish you each day till I die
For all eternity you and I

And baby together (baby together)
There is so much we've yet to see
And now and forever (now and forever)
I pray you'll always be here with me
Eternally

We're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin hand in hand
For all eternity
Ooh, ooh
For all eternity
