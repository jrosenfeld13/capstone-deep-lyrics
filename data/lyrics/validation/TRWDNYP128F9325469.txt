[Verse 1]
As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

[Chorus]
Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please, can I have one chance to start again?

[Verse 2]
Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there anyway to be made whole again?
If I'm healed, renewed, and find forgiveness
Find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

[Chorus]
Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

[Bridge]
He took my life into his hands and it turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I've finally found

[Chorus]
That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh, thank You for my chance to start again
