[Verse 1]
Just because you said things have got to change
They won't go away
Nothing goes away

[Chorus]
Not unless you do the things you promised to
So walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

[Verse 2]
Saying something's wrong isn't good enough
That won't make it right
Gotta make it right

[Chorus]
And the only way is doing what you say
So walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

[Bridge]
There's nothing that's so bad that leaving it alone
Just doesn't make it worse
Time won't wait
Maybe tomorrow it may be too late

[Verse 3]
Don't just stand alone on a mountain top
Join the world today
Do it right away

[Chorus]
Don't you know that you are only what you do
So walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Don't you know that you are only what you do
So walk the way you talk and talk the way you walk

[Skat]
