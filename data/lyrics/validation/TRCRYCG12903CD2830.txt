Some days I might rejoice
My face shining with self-praise
Everyone else is inferior
The force to seal my doors
To ignore the voice of yours
Always makes me feel superior

This is the fortress of me
Foundations in vanity

Here I've built myself high
Head of mine scrapes the black sky
Celebrating my authority
I shall answer no calls
My halls protected by walls
Harbour of my precious sanctity

This is the fortress of me
Foundations in vanity
Insanity

Ivory tower standing fast
Standing tall
I pictured myself
Show me how much will burn with me
Tumbling down
As one day shall
My tower fall
