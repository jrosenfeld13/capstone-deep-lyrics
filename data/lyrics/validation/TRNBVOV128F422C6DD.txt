[x2]
This is the rythym of summer nights (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing until the morning light
Our favorite dj is playing our favorite song (summer nights)
Night after night I've been waiting for someone
I looked up and you were there
But I can't remember this feeling I'm feeling
I know that you've answered my prayers
For once in my life I found someone to love and who really cares
For once in your life you know, you've found some love and you just can't pretend
All of my life I've been waiting
This is the rythym of summer nights (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing until the morning light
Our favorite dj is playing our favorite song (summer nights)
This is the rythym of my life
You feel the music, the magic of the night
Two bodies dancing to our favorite song
Day after day I've been searching and searching for someone to love me for me
See I never knew of this passion inside me
You came and set my heart free
Now I wanna share my life
My soul, my dreams, with you every night
Cause I wanna let you know I'm a stronger man with you by my side
All of my life I've been waiting
This is the rythym of summer nights (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing until the morning light
Our favorite dj is playing our favorite song (summer nights)
This is the rythym of my life
You feel the music, the magic of the night (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing to our favorite song (summer nights)
(This is) All of my life I've been waiting
This is the rythym of summer nights (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing until the morning light
Our favorite dj is playing our favorite song (summer nights)
This is the rythym of my life
You feel the music, the magic of the night (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing to our favorite song (summer nights)
All [x8]
This is the rythym of summer nights (summer nights)
Two bodies dancing until the morning light
Our favorite dj (summer nights) is playing our favorite song (summer nights)
