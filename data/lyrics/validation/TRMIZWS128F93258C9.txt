Young runaway
Upstanding man
The spring you seek is not for them
To stroke his cheek
And thus repair the a-hole
Of his creator
You always complain no one's good
Well here you are let them see
Tommy and dan
You can't hold hands
Down your street
Who cares you're gay
But it's your age
No friend oh
A wretched life to sit through
His sister cries "you'll go to hell"
You're unsure if he's legal
It's more
Tommy and dan
You can't hold hands
Down your street
Who cares you're gay
But it's your age
No friend oh
Tommy hits those apartments up
They cannot love anything
You hear a sign
Is this what you meant
When you wrote your sister
A chance you take
Is they derride your wicked heart
I'm by your side
They don't understand what you do
So what for nor do you
Tommy and dan
You can't hold hands
Down your street
Who cares you're gay
But it's your age
No friend oh
