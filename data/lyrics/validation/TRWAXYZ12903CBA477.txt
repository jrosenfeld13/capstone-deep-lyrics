Bobby's driving through the city tonight
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car
He joins the lover in his heavy machine
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby

Johnny's taking care of things for awhile
And his style is so right for troubadors
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby

[Bridge]
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay
Together
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone
Forever

[Verse 3]
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hello's and goodbye's
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby

[Bridge]
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay
Together
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone
Forever

[Verse 3]
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hello's and goodbye's
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
