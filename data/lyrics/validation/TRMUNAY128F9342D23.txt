When I first saw her, I knew that I loved her
When I said goodbye, I knew that I lost her
Now that I miss her, I wish I could kiss her
And tell her c'mon girl, you know that I need you

And without her, it all feels the same
And without her, you got no one else to blame

I went to the movies and stared at the big screen
I thought that I saw her looking right at me

And without her, it all feels the same
And without her, you got no one else to blame
But yourself, but yourself

And all I can do is just write a song about her
And hope that one day, hope that one day
She turns around, she turns around

I hear the phone ringing I know that she's calling
I hear her voice singing and this is her answer
