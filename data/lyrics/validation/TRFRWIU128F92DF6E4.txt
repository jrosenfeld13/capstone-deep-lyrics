You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession

Inside out, upside down
There's no doubt
Boy you're driving me crazy

Mystified, hypnotized
Cannot fight
Oh resistance is fading

Come over and take my hand
I want you to be my man
I know you don't understand
I'm going crazy

You're playing the staring role
Convincing my hungry soul
I'm losing my self control
I'm going crazy

You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession

You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession

All my vein, down the drain
Can't contain
Boy you're driving me crazy

So divine, blow my mind
On cloud nine
Oh resistance is fading

Come over and take my hand
I want you to be my man
I know you don't understand
I'm going crazy

You're playing the staring role
Convincing my hungry soul
I'm losing my self control
I'm going crazy

You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession

You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
You make me feel, so real
You are my obsession
