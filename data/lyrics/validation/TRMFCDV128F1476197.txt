[Intro]
One two three four

[Verse 1]
Oh you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

[Pre-Chorus]
I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

[Verse 2]
Why don't you stay the evening
Kick back and watch the T.V
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Ohh I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee my sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

[Bridge]
I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

[Verse 3]
We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where is my Marlboro Man
Where is his shiny gun
Where is my lonely ranger
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where have all the cowboys gone
