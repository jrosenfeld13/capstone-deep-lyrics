(Andy Sears)
Time to light the fuse
Hey you!--With that innocent face
Stand proud of the crowd
Sugar sweet surprise--
Time to shatter your illusions
And open your eyes,--
A thousand angry hearts
Fire burning
Young hearts will bury the flag
Faces glowing in the light
Of words that have no strength to bite
Sad country sleep soundly, unaware
Careful not to tilt the game
Both sides must remain the same
Dreams of solutions
To/too many years of frustrations
Time after time after...
Fat preachers
Bury their bones in secretive holes
Invisible to naked eyes
Enclosed in metal uniforms
Ulterior motives
All the lies and excuses
Time after time after
Time after time after...
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Monkey, monkey
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Go, hey, go,--
Malignant deceivers
Puncture our veins
If we fall now the chances are
We'll never raise our voice again
Sing to the future
Certain from here everafter
Again--
Time after time after time
Just take a minute to breathe!
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Monkey, monkey
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Light the fuse--
Go, hey, go,--
Hey monkey!
