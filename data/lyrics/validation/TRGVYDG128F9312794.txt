Raised to protect the things they may own
While we were raised on our own
Take from the fist and kill what you don't know
This line is ready to go

First you will hear the awakening earth
It casts a spear with its sound
If you are old, grab ahold of your young
Or else they may end up under the ground

If your side is shaken, hold on
You see the center is going soft
Take your conscience off of this fault
Pace back and forth as our thoughts impart

If your side is shaken, hold on
You see the center is going soft
Decide

Take your conscience off of this fault
Step back and forth as our thoughts impart
Divide
