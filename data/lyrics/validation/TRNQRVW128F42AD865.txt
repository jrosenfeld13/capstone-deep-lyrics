I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On
I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On
Then I Can Say I'm Finally Over You
I'm, I'm Finally Over You
I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On

Can't Wait Til' You Are Gone

You Say That You Are No Longer In Love With Me
And Uh
You Can Not Be
The One For Me
Told Me That This Love Of Ours
Is Taking Us Down Different Roads
And Its Caused Us To Grow
Apart And So

Girl Don't Say To Me
That You Want To Be
Be Good Friends With Me
That's Just Teasing Me
Girl It's Best You Leave Now
Say Goodbye To Me
Cause You Should Know Girl
That I'...

I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On
I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On
Then I Can Say I'm Finally Over You
I'm, I'm Finally Over You
I Can't Wait Til' You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On

Can't Wait Til' You Are Gone

(Put A Break In It)
I Just Need You To Leave Me Baby
That Way I Could Move On Ya Feel Me

I Just Need You To Leave Me Baby
That Way I Could Move On Ya Feel Me
That Way I Could Move On

Then I Can Say I'm Finally Over You
I'm, I'm Finally Over You
I Can't Wait Til You're Gone Away
Cuz Then I
Can Move On

Can't Wait Til' You Are Gone
