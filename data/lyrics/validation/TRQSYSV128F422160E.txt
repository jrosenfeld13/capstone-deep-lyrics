Everything I've got has certain places to go
A shelf for this and a drawer for that thing
A special something for that special someone
A little room where people leave me alone
Now I'm putting items into their spots
I can fit this lid directly on this box
I will count to ten in alphabetical order
I would buy a uniform if I could afford it
Shut me up with my own screaming
Show me how to be forgiven
I'm sure that there's something missing
But I'd better tend to my own business
Carefully I twist the proper lid on this jar
Reconnection pieces that have fallen apart
Spacing equal inches when I'm setting the table
Removing accumulated lint from my navel
Today I will spend my time renaming the parts
Of all the mechanisms listed here on this chart
I've got twenty seconds to absorb all the feelings
Of a complicated subject that I'm not finished dealing with
I don't know what I'm talking about
It seems like it's very important
I'm having trouble expressing this concept
Theres something here and I can't ignore it
I know there's something wrong with me
