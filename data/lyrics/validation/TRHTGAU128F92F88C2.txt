Oh, eat your animal crackers
'Cause my mother told me so long ago
"If you eat your animal crackers
The children in Europe won't starve anymore"
Ha ha hahaha hahaha
Oh, once I went on a diet
A carbohydrate diet ain't nice
'Cause you can't eat animal crackers
So, I'm gonna stay a fatty for all of my life
Ha ha hahaha hahahaha
But some people think that fatties are nice, yeah
I love eating icecream
Chocolate, vanilla and butter pecan
But I best love animal crackers
'Cause I love helping my fellow man
Yeah, I really do

Did you ever hear of Alice's restaurant?
