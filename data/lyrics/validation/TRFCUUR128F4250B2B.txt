Eternal winter, societies drown
To freeze the rapture bring heavens down
Eternal winter, shadows from afar
A few chosen wander

The unworthy god's creation must be
Forever swept away
A new world order must be
Created by man
Men of will, men of depth
And strength in their hearts
Shall ascend above all

A dawning world fell into decay
Due to mental destruction
Caused by poisonous thoughts
Forced upon us
Let us build upon the past
And indulge wisdom far beyond God
Let forever our roads diverge
We shall leave the era of historical fraud

We learned from the past
What's good in a sense may be
Devastating wrong
Self-denial tells the weak from the strong

Dethrone the hypocrites
And crown our spirit in blood and gold
Never again
Shall the twisted word be told
And for those who try to escape
From the scene
And claim their faith in the Nazarene
Hunted you shall be like the sun
When winter comes
And the hunt has begun

We learned from the past
What's good in a sense may be
Devastating wrong
Self-denial tells the weak from the strong
Men of will, men of depth
And strength in their hearts
Shall ascend above all

The blessing may not come from the sky
Snow may not fall in an everlasting night
Dream, dream of what ways there will be
Still we hail the winter as
A symbol for the time
When Jehovah's kingdom dies

And if some souls of strength
Would survive though repeatedly
Ripped and torn
We shall tread upon these unfortunate
Let us march into a brand new dawn
