Shake off those warrior garments
Shake off your warrior armoryeah
Shake off those warrior garments
Shake off your warrior armoryeah

Money for your souls
What if they were to tell the young one
All of them dancing upon the moon let them be so, so, so
Let them become Lord

Is it night time again? (man it cant be so)
Is it night time againno cant be Lord
Well its night time again, oh are you

Sleeping Bag-o-wire
Sleep in a bag o wire, oh Lord
Sleeping Bag-o-wire

Man their armies grow strong, they grow strong
And the young they are well, well, well
All of them use to be so free and so clean hearted unto you and me

But they were caught in a inversion like a dutty soul, man de were lost in all direction!

Sleeping Bag-o-Wire
Sleep in a bag o wire
Sleeping Bag-o-Wire

It cant be no dutty soul
It cant be no dutty soul
Cant be no dutty soul
Man it cant be no, no, no, no!

Well its night time again
Look its night time againcant be so
Man its night time again, or are you

Sleeping Bag-o-wire
Sleep in a bag of wire
Sleeping Bag-o-wire

Shake off your warrior garments
Shake off those warrior armoryeah

I man just a chanting for your crisis
Playing music for no prizes

Man its night time again sleep well my friend
Its night time asleep, sleep, sleep
Look its night time again oh are you

Sleeping Bag-o-wire
Sleep in a bag of wire
Sleeping Bag-o-wire
