Company
Always on the run
Destiny
Is the rising sun
I was born 6-gun in my hand
Behind a gun, i make my final stand
That's why they call me...
Bad Company. And i can't deny
Bad Company, til the day i die. til the day i die. til the day i die..
Rebel souls. Deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns, they all know our name
6-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say..
Bad Company, and i won't deny
Bad. Bad Company, til the day i die. til the day i die..
Hey hey, Bad Company, i can't deny..
Bad Company, til the day i die
It's Bad Company. Oh yeah yeah
Bad Company, til the day i die
Tell me you're not a thief, oh but im bad company
It's the way I play. Dirty for dirty
Oh somebody double crossed me
Double cross
Double cross
Yeah, we're Bad Company
Kill in cold blood...
