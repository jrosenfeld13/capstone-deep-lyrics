We can't keep pissing in the wind
Bleaching holes in perfect skin to make us new
Hold a match until it burns
Got ourselves against the wall, nowhere to go

Try to be my best to you
As I recall I never lied to you it's true
Wrapped around you like an eel
You reel me in don't throw me back into the pool

Cause we're floating by
In a magic sky
You just make it right
While the whole world slides

Leave it all just for a while
Driving off the edge, sailing to the moon
Leave behind all this denial
Just take a piece of life and suck it in for good

Cause we're floating by
In a magic sky
You just make it right
Watch the whole world slide

Take a walk into a sea
Take a walk into the sea
It's full of golden things you need
Or we can fly

Cause we're floating by
In a magic sky
You just make it right
While the whole world slides
Cause we're floating by
In a magic sky
You just make it right
While the whole world slides
