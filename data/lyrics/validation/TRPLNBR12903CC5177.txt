I'm a big race horse
I can run so fast
I don't even think about bein' last
When I make my move
I don't feel no pain
I got running blood rushin' through my veins

So don't hold on
Don't hold back
If you gonna run
On the winnin' track
'Cause tryin' hard is not enough
You've got to have the runnin' blood

(yeah)

I wanna feel the wind blowin' through my mane
I can't be held back and I can't be tamed
I'm a wild horse runnin' across the plains
I got runnin' blood so cut loose my reins

So don't hold on
Don't hold back
If you gonna run
On the winnin' track
'Cause tryin' hard is not enough
You've got to have the runnin' blood

I'm gonna have a winning season
You're really gonna see me shine
God gave me strong legs for a reason
To be the first to cross the line

At the starting gate
Hear that pistol crack
Feel the muscles rippling across my back
When I make my move I'll give it all my strength
When that runnin' blood beats 'em by a length

So don't hold on
Don't hold back
If you gonna run
On the winnin' track
'Cause tryin' hard is not enough
You've got to have the runnin' blood

Don't hold on
Don't hold back
If you gonna run
On the winnin' track
'Cause tryin' hard is not enough
You've got to have the runnin' blood

(hah)
