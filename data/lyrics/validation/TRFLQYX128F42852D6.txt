Oh please, believe baby, oh it's just a sad sad memory
Oh please, believe baby, oh I swear that I'm not blind to see
Oh you broke my heart, and I mean what I say
I tell you, I swear you, I love you
Oh don't tear apart, baby please stay
I tell you, I'll swear you
Baby I love you it's true

Oh baby don't let me down
Oh baby don't fool around
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me oh take me tonight

Oh please, believe baby, we're closer to heaven, it's true
Oh please, believe baby, there's no me oh babe without you
I'm calling your name, and I mean what I say
I tell you, I swear you, I love you
My love is a flame, oh show me the way
I tell you, I'll swear you
Baby I love you, it's true

Oh baby don't let me down
Oh baby don't fool around
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me oh take me tonight
Oh baby don't let me down
Oh baby don't fool around
Oh baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me oh take me tonight

Don't play a game with me-That's unfair, you'll see
Oh don't be so scared-Baby please dare
Don't be so scared of my love
