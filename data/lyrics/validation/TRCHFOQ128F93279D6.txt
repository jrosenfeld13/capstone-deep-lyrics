I took a trip down to Old Mexico
I was lookin' for some fun and laughter

I met a woman said gimme your money
And I'll show you everything your after

I was taken to a sleazy room
And she handed me a Mexican cocktail

When I woke up in the mornin' light
I was a locked in the county jail

I was broke
I was busted
I was broke
I was busted

Paid the man some to set me free
And I headed for the borderline

Cross the frontier and I drove like the devil
Tryin' to get back to the shack that was mine

"Pull over son" said the man with the gun
"I believe your breakin' the law"

Open the trunk and my heart just sunk
I knew they gotta had it for sure

I was broke
I was busted
I was broke
I was busted

I was broke
Mama mama I was busted
I was broke
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mama, mama, mama, mama.mama,mama.mama...
