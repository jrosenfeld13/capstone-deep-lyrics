Well i met her on the corner of Broadway
Said she'd seen me coming for a mile
Guess i should of known she was troubled
By the hoodwink in her eye
She said now watch my hands real careful
But i should of been watching her feet
Cause before i knew it she stole my heart and my wallet
Went runnin' on down the street

The greatest hustler of all
Stands about four foot nine
Made to be a moocher
Low down hoochie coocher
Her daddy made herwalk the line
Hustles with the greatest of ease
Fools any boy any time
Greatest hustler in all of this world
Hustled this heart of mine

Now Ive been hustled on the streets of chicago
And the Levees of New Orleans
But i never knew a woman to work so fast
Shes what u call a
Hustling queen
And i took her to the fair on friday
We stepped into the kissing booth
N i puckered my lips
To steal me a kiss
She went n stole my gold tooth

The greatest hustler of all
Stand about four foot nine
Made to be a moocher
Low down hoochie coocher
Her daddy made her walk the line
Hustles with the greatest of ease
Fool any boy any time
The greatest hustler of all of this world
Hustled this heart of mine

Well if u see her coming this way
Boy better take care
Cause she'll hustle your heart away
Into the air
What happens if your down on the corner
Shes not that hard to find
The greatest hustler in all of this world
Stands about four foot nine

The greatest hustler of all
Stands about four foot nine
Made to be a moocher
Low down hoochie coocher
Her daddy made her walk the line
Hustles with the greatest of ease
Fools any boy any time
The greatest hustler of all of this world
Hustled this heart of mine
And the greatest hustler
In all of this world
Hustled this heart of mine
