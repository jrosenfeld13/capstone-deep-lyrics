I've sung the blues
For every broken hearted lovesick dream for you
I've paid my dues
Working hard-sweat, blood and tears for you

[Chorus:]
So far away, So far away, So far away! [x2]

I've had it all
And lost it all in one blackout summer night
I want it back
But I just can't seem to get it right

[Chorus]
I've sung the blues
For every broken hearted lovesick dream for you
I've paid my dues
Working hard-sweat, blood and tears for you

[Chorus]
