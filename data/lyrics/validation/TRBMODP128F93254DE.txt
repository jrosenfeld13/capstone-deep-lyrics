Light a candle
For the old man who sits staring
Out a frosty windowpane

Light a candle
For the woman who is lonely
And every Christmas is the same

For the children who need
More than presents can bring

Light a candle
Light the dark
Light the world
Light a heart or two
Light a candle for me
I'll light a candle for you

Light a candle
For the homeless and the hungry
A little shelter from the cold

Light a candle
For the broken and forgotten
May the season warm their souls

Can we open our hearts
To shine through the dark

Light a candle
Light the dark
Light the world
Light a heart or two
Light a candle for me
I'll light a candle for you

And in this special time of year
May peace on earth surround us here
And teach us there's a better way to live
And with every (every) flame that burns
We must somehow learn
That love's the greatest gift
That we could ever give.....

Light a candle
Light the dark
(light the world)
Light the world
(light a heart or two)
Light a heart or two
Light a candle for me
I'll light a candle for you (I will)
Light a candle (oh, I will)
Light the dark ( because everybody needs a light)
Light the world
Light a heart or two (ohhh)
Light a candle for me (you know I will)
I'll light a candle for you(you can light a candle)
Light candle for me
I'll light a candle for you
(i will)
Light a
Light a candle for me
Oh, I'll light a candle for you
