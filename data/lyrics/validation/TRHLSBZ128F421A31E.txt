All those days
Wasting time
We used to spend
Away from each other
And I can't believe it
Could it be the start of something?
Could it be the end of a phase?
Could it be the start of the future?
Could it be the good old days?
Cause lately I have been so down and so lonely
I have been so beaten and blue
I have been so lost and so broken
I have been so nasty to you
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
