Now there's a wicked way ta party that cha gotta know
Ye need a little bit a rhythm and a lotta go
If ye wanna go out I can't wait to go

Now to Ceilidh right need a bright light shine
I'll show you yours if you show me mine
Before you know it everybody's feelin' fine

Don't you don't know ya, we're gonna show ya
Kick out and go to the place where it flows
Gimme the time 'cos I'm an hour behind

C'mon Ceilidh with me
Will ye Ceilidh with me
C'mon Ceilidh with me

Well I want che to know that I wanted too
A superliminial attitude
Is what I cowp whe I got you

Well I feel like a geek when I'm on stage
An' everybody says McKenzie act yer age
But I don't and I won't 'cos it's a total rage
Yeah it's a total rage
