So hot
And wet
Been days and days and days
Since I slept
Been rollin'
And stumblin'
And laughin' and laughin' and laughin'
And cryin' and grumblin'

Oh my heart
And my head
Cryin' out loud through every lonesome cell

When you see me comin' try to be kind
When you see me comin' try to be kind
When you see me comin' try to be kind
Keep in mind I'm losin' mine
When you see me comin' try to be kind

Ohhh
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river deep and wide
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river make it deep and wide
Now float down stream
All the way down stream and go out
With the tide

When you see me comin' try to be kind
When you see me comin' try to be kind
When you see me comin' try to be kind
Keep in mind I'm losin' mine
When you see me comin' try to be kind

Try, try, try
Yeah try, try, try
Try to be kind
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try to be kind
