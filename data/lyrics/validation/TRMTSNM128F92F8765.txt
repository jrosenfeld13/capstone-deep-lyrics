[Verse 1]
Scene One, Curtain up
See the couple, coffee shop, beatniks beating out bebop
Rainy day, skies are grey, but the couple feeling gay
Boy is laughing at her joke, girl embarrassed takes a smoke
She should quit, yes she knows, she's happy as she blows

Down the cafe to the bar, past the hippies and the jars
Of the bean that they drink every day, every week
They should quit, coffee's bad, makes you crazy, fucking mad
But they say in defense, with a pause for suspense

"It's the stuff of the Gods, sexy smart hot rods
Rollercoaster, hurricane, supersonic jet plane
They should quit, yes they know, but where the hell would they go?
They're like me, in a bind, don't you see? Love ain't blind

[Chorus]
I could make a habit out of you

[Verse 2]
Scene two, same play, same people, different day
In a car with no top, no speed limits, no cops
Girl is driving, she's the queen in control of this machine
She's talking much too loud, excited by the sound

They are screaming, buzzing hard, open road, supercar
What they need is some speed, 105 is the key
"Life is short," so they say, "Carpe Diem, Sieze the Day"
They're like me, in a bind, I don't get it, love ain't' blind

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3]
Scene three, city streets
Buying shit, selling too, need a fix or some food
Or some sex, there's a whore looking beautiful but bored
Like to drink?  There's a bar.  Need a lift?  Take my car
A stop for every whim, your heart's desire lets you in


In this city, in this scene, at the party, you're a queen
You're addicted to the lights, to the sounds, to the sights
To the pleasure, to the pain, the hot nights, the cold rain
To the smoke, to the drink, to the buzz, don't think

To the danger, to the fear, to the speed, it's fifth gear
All the time, night or day, there is no choice, that's just the way
Yes you should quit, you know, but where the hell would you go?
You're like me, in a bind, now you see, love ain't blind

[Chorus] x4
