Make my life a prayer to You
I wanna do what You want me to
No empty words and no white lies
No token prayers, no compromise
I wanna shine the light you gave
Through Your Son You sent to save us
From ourselves and our despair
It comforts me to know You're really there

I want to thank You now for being patient with me
Oh, it's so hard to see when my eyes are on me
I guess I'll have to trust and just believe what You say
Oh, you're coming again, coming to take me away

I wanna die and let You give Your life to me so I might live
And share the hope You gave to me
The love that set me free
I wanna tell the world out there that You're not a fable or fairy tale
That I made up inside my head
You're God, the Son
You've risen from the dead

I want to thank You now for being patient with me
Oh, it's so hard to see when my eyes are on me
I guess I'll have to trust and just believe what You say
Oh, you're coming again, coming to take me away

I wanna die and let You give Your life to me so I might live
And share the hope you gave to me
I wanna share the love that set me free
