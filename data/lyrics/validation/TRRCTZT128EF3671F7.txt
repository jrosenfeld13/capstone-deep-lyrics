I know we'll meet again
Drowning in a pool of sin
When words will have no meaning
I'll dream of you tonight

With ashes in my hand
I hope that you could understand
It wasn't meant to be
Different lines no you and me

Can you tell me how it felt
When you saw the cards you dealt
FOREVER IN DENIAL
With open mouth I taste your vile

SNAKE BITE
SNAKE BITE
Can you tell me how it felt
When you saw the cards you dealt
SNAKE BITE
Snake bite!!

Forever in Denial
Forever in Denial!!

With open mouth I taste your vile
With open mouth I taste your vile!!

SNAKE BITE
