Roberts-Hillman

All alone she waits at the window
While the sun sets in the sea
Is that the sound of his foot steps that echoes in the hall
And then they fade away no it wasn't him after all

He was gone in the early morning
And he said he wouldn't be long
But that was spring and now that the leaves have all turned brown
She only shares her bed with the lonliness she has found

Still she waits alone at the window
For the one who wandered away
Each day the room grows colder her tears grow harder to hold
And still she saves her love for the day she knows he'll come home
