Lazybones, when you roam
Don't you close your
Don't you close your eyes

Drenched and armed
Dried and calm
Don't recognise you walking in the light
Don't recognise you walking in the light

If all you do
Leaves with you
Don't you tell no
Don't you tell no lies
Don't you tell no
Don't you tell no lies
Don't you tell no
Don't you tell no lies
