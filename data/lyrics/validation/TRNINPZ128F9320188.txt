Going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
I said I'm going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)

I've got to get back to my baby
And take her in my arms again
I've got to get back to my baby
I ain't seen her since I don't know when
Got to get back now to Florida
Lay out in the morning Sun
Got to get back to Miami
Have a whole lotta fun
Going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl, com on (Going back to my girl)
I said I'm going back to my Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
Look out

I'm going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
I said I'm going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)

Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
I gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Look out!
