I got, I got, I got this feeling
We can, we can get far as we can
Ever since my phone started beepin'
When we won the show on ProSieben

People rockin on over pressing
Making rumors of second guessing
Bahar dated a popstar?
Uh uh, wouldn't go that far

Three girls in the Caddy (like)
Look good in the spot light
We just wanna be (like)
Exception to the rule
We took a chance (like)
If you don't understand (like)
You can talk to the hand (like)
They say girl bands ain't cool

Nobody thought we could make it happen
One year later people still clappin'
Hands and jump and their heads are bumpin'
Hear the single in every club and

Joy is makin' it hot to be us
In the studio with Remee and Thomas
Still no peace for the newcomers
Five degrees, it was still a hot summer

Three girls in the Caddy (like)
Look good in the spot light
We just wanna be (like)
Exception to the rule
We took a chance (like)
If you don't understand (like)
You can talk to the hand (like)
They say girl bands ain't cool

Yeah, yeah
They say popstars to flopstars  now we all got new cars (2x)

Three girls in the Caddy (like)
Look good in the spot light
We just wanna be (like)
Exception to the rule
We took a chance (like)
If you don't understand (like)
You can talk to the hand (like)
They say girl bands ain't cool

Yeah yeah, na na na na na
Na na na na na
