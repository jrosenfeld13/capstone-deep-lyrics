Jelmer - ASCAP

Ooh well now they call my baby Patty
But her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lou
Well they call my baby Betty
But her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lou
She's so fine, fair and pretty, you don't know what my baby's gonna do, my Linda Lou

When she goes strollin' down the street
All the cats, all the cats, all the cats turn and look around
Well now she give everybody the eye
You never know, you never know, you never know what my baby's gonna put down
Everybody always tells me I got the cutest little girl in town

I'm gonna marry that girl next Saturday night
Make her mine for the rest of my life
From now on my rovin' days are through
And it's all because of that chick, Linda Lou

Linda Lou, Linda Lou
Tell me what are you gonna do?
I had a real bad dream last night
Honey you said, you said, you said, you said that we were through
Well now if you ever leave, you're gonna break my poor heart in two, my Linda Lou
Yeah
