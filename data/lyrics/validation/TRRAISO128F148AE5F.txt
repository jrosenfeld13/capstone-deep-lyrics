[Verse 1]
Woke up at eight, started the fire
Had a few drinks, we all felt inspired
Jumped in the stream, our shoes and canteens
The water was bitter cold
Laid in the raft 'til it started moving
The current just sang, its song was so soothing
We stopped along the way
On a beach in the sun on a beautiful day

[Chorus]
Our boats collide, we'd feel the breeze
We'd stay afloat and make the most of everything

[Verse 2]
By noon, we had swung the ropes in the woods
Missed all the danger, snakes and the floods
Burnt by the rays and next to our legs
The water, so bitter cold
Lunch had been saved along with the lighters
Wet cigarettes serve us as reminders
Never trust a man with the food, change of clothes and a drink in his hand

[Chorus]
Our boats collide, we'd feel the breeze
We'd stay afloat and make the most of everything
The sun would set, the stars would shine
The trees would shake, we'd all feel fine
Let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone

[Bridge]
We laughed away the sunburn
As we laughed away the day
What we lost means nothing
For the memories will stay

[Verse 3]
Caught the last bus with no time to linger
Driver seemed to be missing a finger
I turned and looked away to the bus, gravel road and a beautiful day

[Chorus]
Our boats collide, we'd feel the breeze
We'd stay afloat and make the most of everything
The sun would set, the stars would shine
The trees would shake, we'd all feel fine
Let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone
Let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone
