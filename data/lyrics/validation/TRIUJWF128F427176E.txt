Me oh my you thought you had something strong
Me oh my it turned out that you were wrong
Me oh my you your luck seems to be no more
Fighting to get up, falling to the floor
Me oh my you say (I can't know) what you're going through
Funny you forgot (that I've had) the exact same thing from you

If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain

Me oh my you thought you had something strong
Me oh my it turned out that you were wrong
(If you wanna complain)
Me oh my you your luck seems to be no more
(If you wanna complain)
Fighting to get up, falling to the floor

If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department

(My oh my, oh no no
My oh my, oh no no)
