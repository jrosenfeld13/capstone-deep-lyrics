We're all born with a terminal chip installed
And a noose wrapped around the neck
Swallow pride, bite the pain
As you join the world on a steel coffin ride

MY heart burns as I feel my pulse quicken
My only thought is to be erased
To be dissolved like a sun struck shadow
Combat the winds with a serpent smile

One by one we'll be erased
'til our circuitry gets rearranged
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?

This is it, it's the time
The reassessment of the artist of the mind

(Indecipherable)

One by one we'll be erased
'til our circuitry gets rearranged
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?
Yet in awe we try again
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?
The elements we're up against
