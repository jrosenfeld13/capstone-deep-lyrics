You can look away
But you can't disguise
The light that shines so brightly
Is gone from your eyes
It wasn't my mistake
It's nothing you did wrong
Sometimes learning to surrender
Is the same as being strong

Letting go
Letting go
The hardest part is knowing
That I'll miss you so
I'd like to wish you well
Oh but it hurts you know
Sometimes doing what is right
Means letting go
Yeah

As we walk away
Leaving it all behind
I hope we will be satisfied
With what we'll find
And if it's not all you want
I hope it's good enough
To make it worth
The precious things
We're giving up

Letting go
Letting go
The hardest part is knowing
That I'll miss you so
I'd like to wish you well
Hey but it hurts you know
Sometimes doing what is right
Means letting go

Sometimes late at night
I can't believe the things I hear
An angel comes to me
And whispers in my ears
Saying there's a time to read
And a time of the soul
A time for holding on
And a time
Just for

Letting go
Letting go
The hardest part is knowing
That I'll miss you so
I'd like to wish you well
Girl but it hurts you know
Sometimes doing what is right
Means letting go
I'd like to wish you well
Oh but it hurts you know
Sometimes doing what is right
Means letting go
Oh
