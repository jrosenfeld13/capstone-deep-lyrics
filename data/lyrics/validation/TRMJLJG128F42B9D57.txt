Watching your eyes go back and forth
Out on the highway
Watching your heart bend to the road
Kiss your forehead as I turn to go

Following those signs, driving out
Only engine smoke
Frozen in a cloud
Wishing the space would remain

Holding back your tears from letting go of your heart
Leaving the middle of the road
Letting go just a little bit
Till it all spills out the side of the road

Hole in the sea, hole in the heart
There's a hole in your hand where the money just falls
And the pain falls right through
The hole in your head wears right through

The hole in all your plans
There's a hole that shines right through
Shines right through
