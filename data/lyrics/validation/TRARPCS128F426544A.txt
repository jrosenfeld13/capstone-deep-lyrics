Down, down, down
Shicka, shicka, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Shicka, shicka, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Licka, ticka, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Licka, ticka, down, down, down
There was nothing drown in my little town
No one I could be
Nobody there in the empty square
Soon to include me
So I barrowed myself a stolen van
And I got myself to where I am
I made my escape while no one watched
And inside my head
I had just one thought
It was freedom that I wanted
Freedom that I got
Ready or not
It's another world I find me in
I think someone stole the van
And the people here are like aliens
And I don't know what I am
And the pretty, pretty girls I thought I could trust
Have taken everything but my bad luck
Now I'm not so bad
And I'm not so hot
I said I don't care
But I care a lot
It was changes that I wanted
Changes that I got
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
Now I'm not so radical as I thought
I said I don't care
But I care a lot
It was freedom that I wanted
Freedom that I got
Ready or not
