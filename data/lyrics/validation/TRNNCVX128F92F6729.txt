[Verse 1]
Wasn't I good to you
Didn't I show it
And if I ever hurt you
I didn't know it

[Verse 2]
If you think I don't care
Then you're mistaken
My love was always there
But now my heart's breakin'

[Chorus]
Oh baby, oh what a crying shame
To let it all slip away
And call it yesterday
Oh baby my life would be so blue
My heart would break in two
Oh what a crying shame

[Verse 3]
'Cause I believed in you
From the beginning
I thought our love was true
But now it's all ending

[Chorus]
Oh baby, oh what a crying shame
To let it all slip away
And call it yesterday
Oh baby my life would be so blue
My heart would break in two
Oh what a crying shame
Oh baby, oh what a crying shame
To let it all slip away
And call it yesterday
Oh baby my life would be so blue
My heart would break in two
Oh what a crying shame

[Tag]
Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame
