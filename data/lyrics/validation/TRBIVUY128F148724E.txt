The drunk kids
The catholics
They're all about the same
They're waiting for something
Hoping to be saved

Well I have been happy
The past couple days
Just thinking of the women
Who've taken your place

And every night I think
I certainly won't ever sleep sober or alone
And then suddenly it occurs to me
I've slept alone before you
And so I pour myself
The stiffest drink my stomach can stand
And convince myself to lay back down again
I'm gonna lay back down
I'm gonna lay back down again

The drunk kids
The catholics
They're all about the same
They're waiting for something
Hoping to be saved

They crawl from the oceans
To paint in the caves
But I'm working all weekend
I need to get paid
