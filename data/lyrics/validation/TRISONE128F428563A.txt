It's almost summer you know and I can't wait to go
Diggin' my toes in the sand
Spendin' long summer days soakin' up some rays
To the sound of a reggae band

My baby looks so good but I knew she would
And I'm so glad she's mine
I'm gonna kiss her again while the waves roll in
It's just a wonderful waste of time

Oooh, put all our cares behind us
Wrapped in each others arms is where you'll find us

Kickin' back on a beach with my lover in reach
Holdin' her hand in mine
Crazy things that we do may not matter to you
It's just a wonderful waste of time

Ooooh, we're dancin' a hole to China
Even though we're on a beach in Carolina

Ooooh, moonlight walks by the ocean
Ooooh, there's no need to control our emotions

I wanna tell you my friend I'd like to do it again
There's no reason or rhyme
Spendin' time on the shore, I'd like to do it some more
It's just a wonderful waste of time

It's just a wonderful waste of time
Just a wonderful waste of time
A wonderful waste of time
It's a wonderful waste of time
It's a wonderful waste of time
A wonderful waste of time
A wonderful waste of time
A wonderful waste of time...
