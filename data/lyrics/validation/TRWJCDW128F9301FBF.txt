You can be a Righteous Rocker or a Holy Roller
You can be most anything
You can be a Child of the Son or a Skid Row Bum or
You can be an Earthly King

But, without Love you ain't nothin'
Without Love
Without Love you ain't nothin'
Without Love

Say, without Love you ain't nothin'
You ain't nothin', nothin', nothin'
Without Love you ain't nothin'
Without Love
