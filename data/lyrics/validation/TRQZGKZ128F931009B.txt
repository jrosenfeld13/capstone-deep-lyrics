I like to drive fast in my car
But I know I won't get too far
Before I see the setting sun
And stop my car and start to run

Towards the curved edge of the earth
That separates the sky from dirt
In a meadow under stars
I realize how small we really are

Since I am born of modern man
I find it hard to take a stand
For the laws of gravity
That demonstrate you're just like me
Everyone I've ever met
Is so in love with wet cement
And hands and feet pressed into it
Of all the people they will never know

Our skin will rot and decompose
And we will become one of those
Where all the worms have made their homes
But all our names will be in stone. "Oh no!"

Though I am afraid
I will be alone for a while
And yes I am afraid
That I will be alone for a while
