There's not gonna be no stairs, no
Just a ladder to the loft where
There's a single bed
A carpet on the floor
Maybe a little window
Always will stand open
I'm thinking maybe
A blue-colored door
Down to the kitchen
A homemade shelf and table
???
A ??? for the cookie
Lamps for the perfume
???
Fireplace that works
A new sofa, blankets and pillows
Curtain of old canvas
Candles all around
Maybe a shower in the bathroom
??
So someone goes
Telephone is ringing, can it be
There's a little garden
Some herbs and a few tomatoes
?? with the shadow
And a chair in the sun
Hear the music playing
A dog running around
There are children
