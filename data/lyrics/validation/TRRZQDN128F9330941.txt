I can remember the times
When the grace was
Shining on my face
Don't you see, don't you feel
Those days are gone
They've vanished in the air
Now I could not care less
Of you and your poisoned mind
Cos I have already seen
This thousand times

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
That we once shared
On these frontlines
Frontlines of mysteries!

Hell yeah!

I can remember the love
At some point it became
One with my hate
And I can see how
You are wasting your life
Wasting your dignity
The light in my eyes is fading away
But I bleed no tears
Cos I know your destiny

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
That we once shared
On these frontlines
Frontlines of mysteries!

How blind can you be?
Don't you know what I mean?

Love divided, love divided
Extending agony!
Love divided, love divided

I hate your empty words
And the grin on your face, ah!

My emotions are hidden
In a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
That we once shared
On these frontlines
Frontlines of mysteries!

How blind can you be?
Don't you know what I mean?

Love divided, love divided
Extending agony!
Love divided, love divided

I hate your empty words!
