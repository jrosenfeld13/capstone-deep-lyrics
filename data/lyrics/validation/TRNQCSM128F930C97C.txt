I ask forgiveness
I know I've lived in shame
Sometimes I have to wonder
Do you even know my name?
I'm sure it's no surprise to you
There are no heathens in foxholes
But what I want to ask you now
Is coming from my soul

I always kept a picture of you
I haven't looked at it for years
Now I'm reaching out to you
Through my solemn tears

So help me god, I need you now
Don't turn away from me
I swear to you, I shall believe
From this day on

I'm living all alone now
I thought I would be fine
No one at night, to hold me tight
So I don't lose my mind

Now I'm reaching out to you
Through my drunken tears

So help me god, I need you now
Don't turn away from me
I swear to you, I shall believe
From this day on
So help me god
Believe me now
So help me God
I need you now
