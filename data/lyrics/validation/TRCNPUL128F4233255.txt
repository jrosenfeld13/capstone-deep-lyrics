Standing on a corner fall is in the air
When looking up at people remember not to stair
Seasons in the city
Seasons in the city

From here to New York or Chicago
The radio's on out the window
Seasons in the city
Seasons in the city

As the world goes around I'll be waiting
Leaves are turning brown the colors are fading
Seasons in the city
Seasons in the city

As the world goes around
As the world goes around
Seasons in the city
