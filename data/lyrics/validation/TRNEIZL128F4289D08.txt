Forgot about the girl I didn't kiss
About the one show that I missed
I sorta figured out that things
Will turn out alright
There's no use holding on to the past
Live it up, man, have a blast
Stop your whining, pal
And go and have some fun tonight

You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
And things will turn out alright
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
And have some fun tonight

My life is changing so rapidly
I'm not sure what I wanna be
But I understand I've still got a lot to learn
I'm pretty happy with my life
And I'm really glad you said you'd be my wife
Even though we know that forever has an end

I'm gonna tell the world
About my baby girl
Starla is her name, oh yes indeed
