It's not difficult
For me to say I love you
It wouldn't be difficult
If you would say the same
And believe me when I tell you
That I know you very well
I know you like I know my name

I think that I have met you
Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all
And I know you must be thinking
"What a silly girl"
I know your every thought and scheme

I wake up to the feeling each morning
I go to bed to it at night
I know you, I live you

Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I know you as if I've known you all my life
I know you, I live you

One day you'll realize
We're not strangers
You'll open up your eyes
And know me too
And you'll see that we were
Meant to be together, my dear
And now the rest is up to you

I wake up to the feeling each morning
Go to bed to it at night
I know you, I know you

Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I feel you as if you were a part of me
I know you, I know you
Like I feel a sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
I think I know you more than you know yourself
I know you, I live you
Know you, live you
Know you, live you
Know you, know you, know you

And without me you'd stumble
And without you I'd fall
Without each other we would not be at all

(Whoa)
Like I feel the sun in the morning
Like I see the moon at night
Like I feel the sun in the morning
(I know you)
Like I see the moon at night
(I live you)
Like I feel the sun in the morning
(I live you)
Like I see the moon at night
Like I feel the sun in the morning
(Oh, like the moon)
Like I see the moon at night
(Love you)
