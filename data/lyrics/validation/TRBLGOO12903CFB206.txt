I think I bit my tongue today
No sign of blood
But this taste won't go away
Even if awound does heal
Its scar might never fade

Unwelcome words can pierce
And drain the soul
Like aphids on the blossoms leave a hole

Sometimes the heart and mind won't work together
And one gets left behind
While the other pulls ahead
Naive of where it treads

The residue of harmful words outlasts a seeming pardon
Little can undo the work of aphids in the garden

I can't believe that I hurt You with the words I've said
I can't conceive how I fooled my heart and lost my head
But as I watched with wonder as your jaw seem to hit the ground
I realized that I stuck my foot right in my mouth
And what a big foot it is ...

I wish that I could turn back time
Alter memory or pay some kind of fine
Anything to make amends
Fix this break to where it bends

The residue of harmful words outlasts a seeming pardon
Little can undo the work of aphids in the garden

I can't believe that I hurt You with the words I've said
I can't conceive how I fooled my heart and lost my head
But as I watched with wonder as your jaw seem to hit the ground
I realized that I stuck my foot right in my mouth

These words are fugitives
Too harsh or too honest
A little pain will gain
If I bite my tongue for your sake
