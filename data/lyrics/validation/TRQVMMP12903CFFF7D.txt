 I tried, but it wasn't enough
 Really tried, but it just wasn't enough
 And now he's with somebody new
 But I still hear him call my name
 He's the one who left me, yeah
 He's the one who left me, yeah
 He broke my heart and now he's back
 But I just haven't the time
 For the one who left me
 He's the one who left me, yeah
 He's the one who left me, yeah
 He broke my heart and I almost died
 But I just haven't the time
 For the one who left me
 Well he said that he would always be true
 and he'd never let me go
 How could I have ever been so foolish back then, yeah
 Well he said that we would always stay
 and he'd never ever leave
 But when I got home one day all his things were gone
 Gone gone gone gone
