He hung himself in the middle of the night
Found dead in the morning bright light
Got no more lithium
Gave up life
They say: you better give up now
Its not worth the strife
The soul constipation

He's turning blue
He's turning blue
He's turning blue
He's turning blue
And nobody cares

He withered
He's not the only one
Come on get it over with
You're not the only one

He's turning blue
[repeat three more times]
And nobody cares
