Its over
My five feet of fortune and fame
And I now need a shoulder

Its over
A quick stop to dry up and up and away
And Im older

Its not over, not over
Till its forgiven or forgotten
Right up this alley
Is Delirious Valley
And Im heading that way
Im heading that way

But its alright
Its just my past
It would never last

It may have been glorious
It may have been fine
No more to keep
Than youth in a wine
And Im heading that way
Im heading that way

Im already past
The present
And into the future

It may have been hard
It may have been with sorrow
But dont let it strangle
The joys of tomorrow
And Im heading that way
Im heading that way

Learning
Is living
And Ill never
Quit living

Its over
