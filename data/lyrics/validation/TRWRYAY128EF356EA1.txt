Laying naked
Your chest to my face
And I can hear your heart
Ive already picked out my favorite part
Gonna give me flashbacks
Flashbacks

Baby baby, can you see what I see
Could it really be that those are your hands and those are my hands

Boy that was beautiful, and that is what you are
Best I had thus far, wouldnt lie
I have wished a hundred times
I would get the sign
That you wouldnt mind layin right here where you are

If I could, I would, stay with you all day
If I could, I would stay
Stay with you all

We ain't gotta go out, we can order shit in
Figurin each other out, takin the other one in
Looking you right in the eye, doing things we never tried before never with nobody

Oooooooh
Boy that was beautiful
Have I told you so
Cause I want you to know how you moved me
I can see the afternoon
Creeping in the room
Gotta leave you soon
I dont wanna

If I could, I would, stay with you all day
If I could, I would, stay
Stay with you all day all day all day all day
