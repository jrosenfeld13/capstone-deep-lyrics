I'm your prof professor of love!
One is an Adam
One is an Eve
Everything is relative
Flying in my cosmic ship to the planet Earth

Join me on my plastic trip through the Universe
Boys and girls around the world ready for a game

Who is who on this pearl
Do you guess my namez

Albert Einstein
Checkcheck the timetime

Albert Einstein
Lovelove is finefine
One is clever
One naive
Everything is relative

Coming from the Milky Way with my galactic crew

Mars and Venus fade to grey
The energy is you
Timemachine and laserbeam
The glance of Marco Polo

The school is ruled by Fronkensteen
Dance the tango solo

Albert Einstein
Checkcheck the timetime

Albert Einstein
Lovelove is finefine
One is a butler
One is a chief
Everything is relative

Welcome to my laboratorium!
Foraday will send a blitz to Jimmy Hendrix in Hotel Ritz

Kopernikus wears blue suede shoes

Isaak Newton sings the blues
Pythagoras and Sokrates rent a computer for Aristoteles

Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde on the couch of Sigmund Freud

This is the formula
Mein Herr!
Energy is mass multiplied by speed of light square

For this to analyse you gave me the Nobelprice
But I tell you this is not enough

I'm the profprof professor of love

Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein

Lovelove is finefine
One is sexy
One sportive

Tout le monde est relative

What did you say
What did you say?
Galileo Galilei
Galileo calls Captain Spock

Und sie dreht sich doch

One is a white boy
One olive
Everything is - Einstein!
