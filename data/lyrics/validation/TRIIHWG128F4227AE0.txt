Album: Bad Azz Mixtape

(Chorus:)
Wish I could f**k her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..
So many miles away

I'm turnin' into Mr. telephone man
Girl, you know I miss ya
So many miles away
And I can't kiss ya
Look but I remember everything
The concert, the room
The shit you whispered in my ear when I had you

Now my Jacksonville chick
She an indo shopper
She like to smoke purple
And chill wit her partners
When I come in town, she cook for me
You know she lookin good for me
Momma white, daddy black
So that ass supa phat

My uptown chick
We still be flirtin
When I see her
She remind me of how I broke a virgin
Think I still drive her crazy
'cause she still wanna date me
Got a man and a baby
Do ya thang, I ain't hatin'

Now my Michigan chick
She was too damn fine
Her pussy stay wet all the time
One of the best to ever ride me
Let me get a car and drive it
Everytime she see Lil Boosie she smilin'

(Chorus:) (2x)
Wish I could f**k her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..
So many miles away

At night I'm on that dro
Just thinkin' bout my distant lover
Wishin' I could call her up and go f**k her
But she stay so many miles away and it's hard
And if I ain't got no shows, I can't even see my broad
She know a nigga livin' large so when we f**kin'
Lil mama gimme everything, she ain't scared of nuttin
She get on top and drop it like it's hot im steady nuttin
My distant lover a lil sexy lil sumthin'.. huh bro.. huh bro..

Now my Tampa chick

She bout what she be talkin' bout
Nasty girl.. take it out her ass put it in her mouth
Knew she was a freak when she got in the backseat
She said she wanted me
And peep, we never shakin' in the sheets

Now my Georgia Peach, ooh
We gon' thug til the end
She don't give a f**k about no lady or none of my friends
And when she seen that man, she hugged me
Tell me, "hi" that she wanna f**k me
I had to show her how to suck me
Nicknamed her "Coldblood"

(Chorus:) (2x)
Wish I could f**k her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..
So many miles away

Girl, I got feelings for you
Mane, I'm on some shit like middle school
I'm tryna write ya letters since I can't come home and chill wit you
I'll f**k her wit her lil dude I need that pussy from you every night
'cause I know it gon' be wet and right
A candlelight dinner 'cause wit me, you a winner
If you wit me, you ridin' Davins other spinners for preteners
I got redbones in different states, every one's got a pretty face
Every one let me grip their waist, every one know I don't play

My thugged out chick, I can't f**k her too often
She bring problems in my life and she do too much talkin'
But I gotta give it to her, with that mouth she the sickest
If you put work up in her hand, she gon' move it wit the quickest
Now my California chick, she the type you don't need
She always trippin' on me when I smoke my weed
I told her, "girl, if you don't like it, then you can get to hykin"
I was trippin' when you told me you was dykin'...!

She... my... distant lover nigga...
Wish I could f**k her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could f**k her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could f**k her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could f**k her everyday..

Distant lover...

(Chorus:)
Wish I could f**k her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my...
Distant lover...
So many miles away
Distant lover...
So many miles away
