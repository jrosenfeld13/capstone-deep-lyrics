Tripping the world imperial
(Look inside her)
Leaving the world material
(Can't hide her)
Tripping the world imperial
(Look inside her)
Leaving the world material
(Can't hide her)

You look at the riverbanks
She's looking behind you
The black clouds they fall hard and heavy
As Eden will astound you

So hail to those who give their lives
Who don't stand back when evil rises
It's not a matter of King or Country

So you think it is over
Do you think it is really over?

Look up that skyline
There's a bad moon rising
You may not like it
But that's the lizard you're riding

The smiles & suits on TV news they feed us all
She's the greatest of liars
The stupid bird who dares to speak the naked truth
Soon lies flat on the wire

So you think it is over
Do you think it is really over?

Look up that skyline
There's a bad moon rising
You may not like it
But that's the lizard you're riding

We're all just the same old sinner
Fighting for a piece of nothing
Same mistakes go round again - same stupid men
Covering up his bloody trail
Cain he came back emptyhanded
With no fathers blessing and no holy grail

Look around you - take it in before your day is done
When I found you - I was cold and all my lovin' gone
Live inside her - Like a spiral
Sending lifelines from the ground
When I found her - she was cold - still in her wedding gown
Look inside her
And now that she's gone - she brought the darkness down
She brought the darkness down

Trees surround you - they say your body is the garden of your soul
Lights will blind you - and all these roads they say they lead to Rome
Eyes have found her - but you say you're better off alone
You plead forgiveness for a soul that's bad beyond the bone

There's truth in numbers
There's truth in scales
There's truth in science
And truth in sales

And when the sweetness comes to an end
You try to bargain to live again

There's truth in progress
There's truth in fame
There's truth in healing
And the truth remains

And when the sweetness comes to an end
You try to bargain to live again

You look around for the brightest minds
Or just a few simple words of kindness
A world gone shallow, cold and mean
It's like a wasteland void of dreams
Hoping and praying that we'll find our way back home

There's truth in numbers
There's truth in scales
There's truth in science
And truth in sales

And when the sweetness comes to an end
You try to bargain to live again

You look around for the brightest minds
Or just a few simple words of kindness
A world gone shallow, cold and mean
It's like a wasteland void of dreams

Hoping and praying that we'll find our way back home

And then the numbers may not come up right
And the artifacts are more than frightening
Between the bible and eternal question
There's an ocean of fear and we're sinking faster

And then the numbers may not come up right
And the artifacts are more than frightening
Between the bible and eternal question
There's an ocean of fear and we're sinking faster

And then the numbers may not come up right
And the artifacts are more than frightening
Between the bible and eternal question
There's an ocean of fear and we're sinking faster
