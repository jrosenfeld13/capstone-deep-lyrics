Missed the way you were yesterday
Backed away from this call
Watching your eyes deeply widen
Impressed with you, impress with me
Perish the thoughts of last words
Everything was new
I have proved that I am yours
You're still waiting
I am yours

Staring at you through my hands
I am already yours
Watching as you walked away
You were always a "someday"
Things change and things change
I'm still here again
I've proved that I am yours
And you're still waiting

Bury my eyes into this Life
Still pressed for the price...
