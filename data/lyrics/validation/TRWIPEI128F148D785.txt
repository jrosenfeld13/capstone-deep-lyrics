[Verse 1]
Brain fried tonight through misuse
Through misuse, through misuse
(Brain fried tonight through misuse)
You can't avoid static abuse
Abuse, abuse
(You can't avoid the static abuse)
Without these pills you're let loose
You're let loose, you're let loose
(Without these pills you're let loose)
Stand up, get out, no excuse
No excuse, no excuse
(No excuse, no excuse)

[Chorus]
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill?

[Verse 2]
Confused, mind bruised, it seeps out
It seeps out, it seeps out
(Confused, mind bruised, it seeps out)
Face down, home town looks so grey
Looks so grey, looks so grey
(Face down, home town looks so grey)
Convexed, you bend, twist and shout
Twist and shout, and shout
(Convexed, you bend, twist and shout)
Stand up, brush off, get moving
Get moving, get moving
(Get moving, get moving)

[Chorus]
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill?
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
(Whole face down)
Home town
(Whole face down)
Home town
(Whole face down)
Home town
It looks so grey
(Whole face down)
Home town
(Whole face down)
Home town
(Whole face down)
Home town
It looks so grey
Whole face down
Home town
Whole face down
Home town
Whole face down
Home town
It looks so grey
Whole face down
Home town
Whole face down
Home town
Whole face down
Home town
It looks so grey

[Chorus]
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
What's that coming over the hill?
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?
Is it a monster?
