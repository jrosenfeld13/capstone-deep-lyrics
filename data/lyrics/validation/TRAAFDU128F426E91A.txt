I felt alone
I put on my new shoes and hit the town
I still felt alone
I'm convinced everyone's built to be put down

I had to say (I had to say)
What I wanted to say (what I wanted to say)
I had to say (what I wanted to say)
Where are you going to stay?

I felt alone
Independence Day comes when you're down
Still felt alone
Ten times I thought I almost found you

Sometimes simple chords are the best
The simple approach is the best if
It makes more sense than any other
It makes more sense than any other

I felt alone
A failed Blake knocked me to the ground
I still felt alone
My attempts at chivalry fell without a sound

I felt alone
So put on your new shoes and leave this town
Still felt alone
I'm convinced, everyone's built to be put down

The simple chords are the best
Sometimes the simple approach is the best if
It makes more sense than any other
It makes more sense than any other
