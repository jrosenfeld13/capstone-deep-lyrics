They label Vitamin D
If you like Vitamin D
It's quite alright with me
But I am here to say
That I like vitamin love
But I can't get vitamin love
With that doggone sun above....

I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my lovin' in the evening time
When I'm with my baby

It's no fun with the sun around
But I get going when the sun goes down
And I meet my baby

That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss
And then we kiss some more
Don't ask how many times we kiss
At a time like this, who keeps score?

So I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my lovin' in the evening time
When I'm with my baby

That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss
And then we kiss some more
Don't ask how many times we kiss
At a time like this, who keeps score?

So I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my lovin' in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
