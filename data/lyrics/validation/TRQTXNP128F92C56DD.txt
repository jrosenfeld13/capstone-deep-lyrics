Lord I adore you
More than I can show you
And it's by your mercy
That I stand before you
And as I worship in truth
I express gratitude
I owe it all to you
Hey, I owe it all to you

[Choir:]
Lord I adore you
More than I can show you
And it's by your mercy
That I stand before you
And as I worship in truth
I express gratitude
I owe it all to you
(Say It Again), I owe it all to you

Almighty Protector
In the time of trouble
It's by your guidance
I come out of struggle
And with a praise on my lips
I won't fail to admit
That I owe it all to you
I owe it all to you

[Lead:]
I dedicate my life and soul to you
My worship is proof of my gratitude
My prayer is that I grow stronger in you

[Choir:]
My strength resides in you Lord
I owe you for that too

[Lead:]
O holy, holy Lamb of God
These tears are from my heart
My existence shows me how mighty you are

[Choir:]
My life belongs to you
I owe you for that too

O Gracious Provider
Ruler of my temple
Bread of my hunger
Water of divine thirst
God of this land and in heaven
This praise I release
I Owe it all to you
I Owe it all to you

For bringing me through
When I turned from you
And extending your hand
When you didn't have to

[Lead:]
For giving a chance
When I needed it reproof

I Owe Ya (We Owe)
I Owe Ya (You for life)
I Owe Ya (Health and Strength)
I Owe Ya [x3]

[Choir:]
How great is your merciful hand on us Who gave us his son
Just to show his love
For your grace and your kindness
We owe you this time ad forever we'll give thanks to you

I owe you my life, I owe you
I owe you my soul, I owe you
I owe you my time, I owe you
I owe you this praise, I owe you
[repeat]
