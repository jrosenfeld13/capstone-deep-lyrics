Constant, this stream of distractions runs constantly
Under my feet, I keep tripping along
Wishing I were stronger

But I know somewhere up ahead is a place where
Waters still run deep, they're whispering come
Beckoning me on

Constant is my Father's calling me
To follow Him against the current
I continue on in His promise to be constant

God did what I could not do
He stayed faithful when I was untrue
So you see I must follow
Where else could I go

Constant is my Father's calling me
To follow Him against the current
I continue on in His promise to be constant

I got carried away, in over my head
Far from the sure line
Never waiting for my hand
He extended His only Son, my lifeline

Constant is my Father's calling me
To follow Him against the current
I will continue on, I will be pulled along
For He is constant, constant

I follow, follow, follow
I follow, follow, follow
I follow, follow, follow my Father
I follow, follow, follow
I follow, follow, follow
I follow, follow, follow my Father

Oh, I'm going on
I can hear Him call
So I'll go on in His promise
Oh, I'm going on
I can hear Him call
So I'll go on in His promise

For he is constant
