Get away from me is all she said
You're like a social disease
I'm so tired of being afraid of you
Her face all twisted he sees

Save yourself
Look and see
Think about it
Sweet sixteen
You could be anywhere
See yourself standing there

She's not dead
She's not dead

He can't stop forcing himself on her
He likes the way that she is
His heart beats, fingers all over her
His dirty breath smells of beer

Save yourself
Look and see
Think about it
Sweet sixteen
You could be anywhere
See yourself standing there

She's not dead
She's not dead
Dead

Come a little closer to me
Come a little nearer, I want

She works late so she can keep away
She's got to go to the police
So young, he's working her like a dog
He slaps her face till she cleans
But one day while she was searching there
She came across a new toy
Her eyes filled as she loaded the weapon
Her mind races, she cries

Save yourself
Look and see
Think about it
Sweet sixteen
You could be anywhere
See yourself standing there
Save yourself
Look and see
Think about it
Sweet sixteen

She's not dead
She's not dead
Dead
She's not dead
Dead
