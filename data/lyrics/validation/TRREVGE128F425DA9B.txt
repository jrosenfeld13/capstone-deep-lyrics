It must have been at least three years ago. I had a crush on this girl I didn't know. I thought it was a good idea at the time but I was pissed. I tried to find her by sending an ad into 'The List'. It was free 'cause they'd just started this brand new section. First I passed it on to my old friend Denise for her inspection. It said: "I saw you twice and both times you were wearing orange. And she told you I fancied you in the toilets at the garage." There was never a reply, perhaps it didn't astound her. That's assuming she ever saw it but I think I've found her. I thought it could've been her in a club on Saturday night. She was a couple of tables away and I thought it might be. But I was far too drunk, so an approach was out of the question. But this guy Stuart had sent us tickets to see his band Belle & Sebastian. We went along thoroughly drunk, stopped for a post-gig "Hello." And I think the girl I was looking for is friends with the girl who plays the cello. I think she's coming to see us when we play. And every time we meet I've got nothing to say. She probably thinks I'm cute, she maybe thinks I'm gay. She's probably got a boyfriend anyway. I remember the first time that I saw her, I was completely in awe. I thought, well that's the kind of girl that I would like to be my squaw. And if I could ever be the kind of brave that she would choose. We'd travel plains with our little baby turned in its little papoose. She starts fore sighting me in a public bar, my bird was in the bog. When she returned she said that she would like to give that girl a snog. And two weeks later we split up and a new lover I was seeking. And when I see that girl again I'm just never up for speaking. I think she's coming to see us when we play. And every time we meet I've got nothing to say. She probably thinks I'm cute, she maybe thinks I'm gay. She's probably got a boyfriend anyway
