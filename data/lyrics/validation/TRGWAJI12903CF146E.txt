I dedicate my life to the mystic law of cause
And effect with the vibration in my voice

Here above the clouds
My porous body floats
Transcending my form
To essence

Flow, river of my soul
To the sea of core experience
A thousand millions hands are joined
In embrace here

Wind is rushing past my face
And streaming through me
I am rarefied
And abstract

I will come to you
And kiss you in a dream
The still of night
Roaring through me
