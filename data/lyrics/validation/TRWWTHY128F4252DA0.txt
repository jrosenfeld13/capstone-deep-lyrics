It was on one Monday's Morning, As I crossed over the Moors, I had little thought of listing 'till the Soldiers did me cross
The company enticed me to drink their health all around
And the bounty
And the bounty
They gave me 5 guineas and a crown
Now my head was full of drink love and I didn't think of you and now I'm forced to go and join the orange and the blues
Our ship she waits at anchor to take the flowing tide
I'll return love
I'll return love in the spring time when i'll make you my bride
So early the next morning, before the break of day
The Captain gave his orders and my love marched away
All in your ranks and files boys, all on your native shore
Fare thee well love, fare the well love
Fare thee well love, Fare thee well love you're the lad that I adore
But I hope you never prosper and I hope you always fail
In everything you venture, I hope you ne'er do well
And the very ground you walk upon, may the grass refuse to grow
Since you've been the
Since you've been the
Since you've been the very cause of my sorrow grief and woe
Well it's true my love has listed
And he wears the blue cockade
He is a handsome young man
Likewise a roving blade
He is a handsome young man and he's gone to serve the king
While my very
While my very
Heart is aching all for the love of him
