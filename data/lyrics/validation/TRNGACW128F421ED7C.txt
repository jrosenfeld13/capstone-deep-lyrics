Rotting flesh upon your plate
Weapons, siege, incorporate
Damage to the manmade shade
Victory is ours to take
Conquering the simple lie
Conquering the simple mind
Praying to a so-called fate
We create their judgment day
Damage your mind
Until you hold your head up high
Until the sun falls from the sky
As they suffer in their defeat
As the cancer starts to breathe
Until the kingdom becomes your own
Until the blood spills from your pores
As the voices start to sing
As the damage starts to breed
Processing their lame excuse
Torturing the self-induced
Command your armies till you bleed
Give the people what they need
