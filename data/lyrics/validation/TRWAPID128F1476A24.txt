How peaceful it feels
Oh, how it feels against my face
Oh, what a long haul
You brought me here for this
I see nothing but disaster
Now Im taking you with me
Taking you with me
A transparent scenery
That comes as fast as it leaves
Now my eyes flash with white
Its settling in with all the flickering
Here again and again
The floor is more fitting for
The floor is more fitting for
My face
Here again? Here again?
This is getting old, this is getting old
Here again? Here again?
I am being watched
This is overwhelming
Paranoia, paranoia
As you dig your feet in
I will sink my teeth in the floor
While I lay here alone
As the light begins
To breach the border
While I lay here alone
Aware of every step
Im not aware at all
Aware of every step
Im not aware at all
Black flash white
Black flash white
I am awake
