There's no one stronger than you
There's no one around
There's no one crazy like you
There's no one around
There's no one who can kill like you
There's no one around
There's no one who can fight you now
You fight on a higher ground
There's no one we can kill like you
There's no one around

You were a soldier
You were a hero
You love the war
You fight for the fatherland
Let me die for your fatherland

There's no one bleeding like you
There's no one around
There's no one who can help you now
There's no one around
There's no one crying like you
You see no helping hand
Ther's no one dead like you
You died for your fatherland
