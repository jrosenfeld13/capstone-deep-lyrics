I keep on looking through the window again
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
And I'm sad, not sorry 'bout the way that things went
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsaken thee
I swore I'd never feel like this again
But you're so selfish
You don't see what you're doing to me

I keep on looking through the window again
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you

You told me lies
And I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
I realize
As you sighed, and you sighed, and you sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I die again

Keep on looking through the window again
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
I'm sad not sorry 'bout the way that things went
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsaken thee
I swore I'd never feel like this again
But you're so selfish
You don't see what you're doing to me

Keep on looking through the window again
And I'm not sorry if I do detest you
No, I'm not sorry and I do detest you

You told me lies
And I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
I realize
And you sighed, and you sighed, you sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again

Keep on looking through the window again
Keep on looking through the window again
