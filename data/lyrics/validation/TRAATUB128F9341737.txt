My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away

And he was talking 'fore I knew it and as he grew
He said, "I'm gonna be like you, dad
You know, I'm gonna be like you"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home? I don't know when
We'll get together then, son
You know, we'll have a good time then

My child turned ten, the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay"

He turned away but his smile never dimmed
"I'm gonna be like him", he said
"Yes, I'm going to be like him"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home? I don't know when
We'll get together then, son
You know, we'll have a good time then

When he came from college, the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"I'm proud of you, son, will you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile

"What I'd really like to do is to borrow the car keys
I'll see you later, can I have them please?"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home? I don't know when
We'll get together then, son
You know, we'll have a good time then

Well, I've long since retired, my child moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time"

He said the new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu
But it's so nice talking to you, dad
It's so nice talking to you

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
My boy's a lot like me, my boy's a lot like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home? I don't know when
We'll get together then, son
You know, we'll have a good time then

We'll get together then, son
You know, we'll have a good time then
