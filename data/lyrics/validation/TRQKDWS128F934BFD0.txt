I've watched in silence, without seeing
As a stranger within me grew
Detached and distanced from the day
While youth's precious years flew

Chasing time through empty skies
Of endless hours
Living for the future

Visions of brighter days to come
Kept the shadows from my sight
Made the present bearable
And obscured the fading light

Chasing time through the cold void
Of solitary days
Living for the future

Today is within my reach
And tomorrow is so illusive
But I'm still chasing time
Through increasing disillusion
Forever living for
The future of an illusion
