Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy Diver
Yeah

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you - look out!

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh, we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away - get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel - yeah!

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

Jump, Jump
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen - yeah!

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me? - No! Yeah!

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away, get away (get away!)
Gotta get away, get away

Holy Diver, sole survivor
Your heart is clean
Yeah, Holy Diver (Holy diver)
Holy Diver (Holy Diver)

You're caught in the middle coming after you, Holy Diver

Oh, Holy Diver (Holy Diver)
Get away, get away, get away - come on!
