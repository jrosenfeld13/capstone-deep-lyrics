Hot rock and rollers
Flash through town, tryin' to make some waves
We'll have some wine, love some women
Another night, another, show to do
Outside snow is falling
Some view, got to get the crew
White rock, makin' me so hot
I like the fever from white rock
White rock, come on make it hot
White fury, white rock
Up all night, sleep all day
Comes the action, when we start to play
Music echoes from the high walls
White rock, never gonna fall
Outside snow is falling
Some view, gotta get the crew
White rock, makin' it so hot
I like the fever from white rock
White rock, come on make it hot
White fury, white rock
White rock, makin' it so so hot
I like the fever from white rock
White rock, come on make it hot
White fury, white rock
White rock, makin' it so hot
I like the fever from white rock
White rock, come on make it hot
White fury, white rock
Make me hot
