Break down the beat [?x]

Open your eyes

Lose the madness

What's the trouble?
Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD

What was I doing?
What was the meaning of this trip?
Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind?
Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story?
Who are these people? these faces?
Where do they come from?
One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people
Is that you can turn your back on a person
But never turn your back on a drug

They gave you what? L S D

LL SS DD
They gave you what?

They gave me the LSD, they took me to the hotel
I don't know what they done to me, but I remember it was horrible

L S D, they gave you what? L S D [?x]

L S D, Oh Yeah!
