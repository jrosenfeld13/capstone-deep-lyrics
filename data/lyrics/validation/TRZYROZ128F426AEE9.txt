This is a song about the place I come from
It's not on the moon at all
Where people's hearts are filled with passion
I miss it so, 'cause I'm here chasing love
In my land of great romantics
I'm the biggest dreamer of them all

No way to stop their desire to change
And to improve our world
One invented Esperanto
Ready to move and to try something new
I'm convinced that Chopin too
Would dig samba if he had a chance to groove

Though it's true
That I only know very few simple words of your language
I've cracked it I've decided
Because the only words we need to communicate
Are the ones that can help me say
"I do love you"
And that make me understand you love me too

Our love will take this globe by storm
If it's London, Warsaw or New York
'Cause all around the world
People want to love and be loved

Open your eyes
There's so much we don't know
We don't even realise
So you might get a better picture
And if I say, that on this planet today
We all have the same hearts
I don't claim I'm Curie or Copernicus

Nasza miloscia podbijemy glob
Londyn, Warszawe albo Nowy Jork
Spojrz tylko wszyscy w krag
Chca byc kochani i kochac chca
