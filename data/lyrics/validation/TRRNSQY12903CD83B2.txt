Hello little boys, little toys
We're the dreams you're believing
Crawling up the walls
Running down your face
Razor sharp, razor clean
Feel the weapon's sensation
On your back
With loaded guns

Now hold onto me pretty baby
If you want to fly
I'm gonna melt the fever sugar
Rolling back your eyes

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive

So what's it gonna take
Silver shadow believer?
Spock rocker with your dirty eyes
It's a chance gonna move
Gonna fuck up your ego
Silly boy gonna make you cry

Now hold onto me pretty baby
If you want to fly
I'm gonna melt the fever sugar
Rolling back your eyes

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive

If what they say is true
You're a boy, and I'm a girl
I will never fall in love with you

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive

We're gonna ride the race cars
We're gonna dance on fire
We're the girls Le Disko
Supersonic overdrive
