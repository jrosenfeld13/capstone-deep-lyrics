[Intro Chorus]
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Hey baby, baby..

[Verse 1]
Im the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (hey baby)

[Pre Chorus 1]
Im just sippin' on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Chorus 1]
All the boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Girls say, girls say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Hey baby, baby.. (hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
All the boys get the girls in the back (back, back, back)

[Verse 2]
Im the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

[Pre Chorus 2]
No matter what they say Im still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

[Chorus 2]
All the boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Girls say, girls say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Hey baby, baby.. (hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
All the boys get the girls in the back (back, back, back)

[Verse 3: Bounty Killer]
Check it out, its Bounty Killer and No Doubt!
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
Afterwards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
(That's right!)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
Afterwards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that, it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady?
If no: maybe? Hey baby!

[Pre Chorus 3: Gwen Stefani]
Im just sippin' on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
(That's right!)

[Chorus 3]
All the boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Girls say, girls say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
Hey baby, baby.. (hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
[Bounty Killer:] Can you be my one and only sunshine lady?
[Gwen Stefani:] Bay-

Girls say (hey baby), girls say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
[Bounty Killer:] When you rock your hips you know that

[Gwen Stefani:] Hey baby, hey baby, hey! (hey baby)
Boys say (hey baby), boys say:
"Hey baby, hey baby, hey!"
All the boys get the girls in the back
