I'd like to know if you can cry
I'd like to see a tear in your eye

I'm tired of you tearing me apart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart

True love won't change, so I am told
But one day you're warm, next day you're cold

I think you enjoy tearing me apart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart

I think you're using me
Till you find someone new
But if you wait too long
You'll have to find me too

Make up your mind and then let me know
Tell me you're mine or leave me alone

I'm tired of you tearing me apart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart

I think you enjoy tearing me apart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart
