Take me to a place
High above the tide
Underneath the waves
Where I can come inside

A reveille
Told in fractured time
Only in this way
Will I become alive

Fill me with your love
Im standing by
You and you alone
Don't ask me why
There's an inner place
I cannot find

So S.O.L. [Shit Out of Luck]
And petrified
So every time
You blow your mind

I wait for you
You never come
You're bleeding through
I must be numb

And you are just a dream
I cannot find
From under what you see
Don't ask me why

Don't leave it alone
My love, my wreckage
I ain't too weak to run
Though slow, Im coming

Once I count the numbers down
To the end or there around
Free or thus, forever bound
For forever's coming down
And finally

Fill me with your love
I'm by your side
You and you alone
Don't ask me why

For you I will be there
I just can't hide
From way beyond the glare
I'll tell you why

Don't leave it alone
My love, my wreckage
I ain't too weak to run
Though slow, Im coming
