Angels from the realms of glory
Stars shone bright above
Royal David's city
Was bathed in light and glow

Jesus Christ was born today
Jesus Christ was born
Jesus Christ was born today
Jesus Christ was born

And all they did rejoice
Fine and pure of voice
And the wrong shall fail
And the right prevail
