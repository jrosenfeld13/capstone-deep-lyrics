[Verse 1]
Oh here we are and here we are and here we go
All aboard and we're hittin' the road
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Verse 2]
Well giddy up and giddy up and get away
We're goin' crazy and we're goin' today
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Chorus]
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna tell your mama what you're gonna do
So come on out with your dancing shoes
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Chorus]
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Chorus]
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Chorus]
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-li-
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

[Chorus]
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world
