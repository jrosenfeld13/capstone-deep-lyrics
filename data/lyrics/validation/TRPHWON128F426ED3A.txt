Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I is, I is
An' I ain't never goin' nowhere
'Less you shares da fun
Dere's no wrinkle on my brow
Nohow
But I ain't goin', you hear me sayin'
If you ain't goin', wid you I'm stayin'

Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I's yours forever
Mornin' time, evenin' time, an'
Summer time an' winter time

INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE

Oh, my Porgy, my man, Porgy

From dis minute I'm tellin' you
I keep dis vow:
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
