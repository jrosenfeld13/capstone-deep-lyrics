When she walks by the men folk get involved
If she winks an eye the bread slice turn to toast
Yes, she's got a lot of what they call the most

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it (The girl can't help it)

She mesmerizes every mother's son
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if she smiles the beef steak comes well done
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She makes grandpa feel like twenty-one
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if I go to her on bended knees
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware
That I can't help it (That I can't help it)
Cause I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me
Yeah...

She walks by the men folk get involved
She winks an eye the bread slice turn to toast
Yeah, she's got a lot of what they call the most

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it (The girl can't help it)

Cause I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me

Yeah, Oh yeah

That's all
