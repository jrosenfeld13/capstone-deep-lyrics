Old friend they told me you were dead
The news broadcast the funeral
500 channels focus in
Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered
The soil was swift to drink your blood
This violence in the name of love!

But I still feel you
Despite your tombstone
But I still feel you
Despite your tombstone
So friend you must still walk among us
In places we don't dare to glance
I saw you killing Aristotle
Now, I know it's all part of the plan

Old friend they told me you were dead
The news broadcast the funeral
500 channels focus in
Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered
The soil was swift to drink your blood
This violence in the name of love!

Old friend they told me you were dead
The news broadcast the funeral

Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered
The soil was swift to drink your blood
This violence, this violence, this violence in the name of love!

To, awake, and, avenge the dead!
To, awake, and, avenge the dead!
