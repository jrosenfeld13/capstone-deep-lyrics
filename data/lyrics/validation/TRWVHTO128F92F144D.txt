[Verse 1]
I lick my brain in silence
Rather squeeze my head instead
Midget man provoking violence
Listen not to what I said

I said, "Please calm it down."
Everything is turning brown

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

[Verse 2]
Laughing lady living lover
Ooh, you sassy-frassy lassie
Find me the skull of Haile Selassie I
Give me shoes so I can tapsy

Tap all over this big world
Take my hand, you ugly girl

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
