You are killing me
Mouth is moving
But I cannot hear you speak
Life's a tragedy, go on living
In a world not for the weak

Keep your dreams inside your heart
Never let the pressure tear you apart
Truth is whispered on a breath
Loud enough to cover
The smell of death

Never thought too important to mention
Living through the birth
The birth of tension
Never thought too important to mention
Living with the tension, tension, tension

Don't you understand?
Too much tension
Snap when you lose your grip
Too many demands, start at birth
Snap from the womb you're ripped

Leave your dreams inside, behind
Never had a reason
That you'll never find
Tension builds another way
Gonna make you all go away

Never thought too important to mention
Living through the birth
The birth of tension
Never thought too important to mention
Living with the tension, tension, tension

Too much tension all around
Too much tension, bringing you down
All the pressures in the narrow mind
All the reasons you'll never find

Did you kill your father?
Sleep with your mother?
Idolise your sister?
Were you jealous of your brother?

Did you kick the dog?
Were you beat with a strap
Were you really abused?
Were you faking all that too tense?

You are killing me
Many ways, so little time to think
Life's catastrophe
Glass is empty and I really need a drink
Moving all so very quick
Moving so fast that it gets me sick

Let me out of here
Living ain't living
With the tension and the fear

Never thought too important to mention
Living through the birth
The birth of tension
Never thought too important to mention
Living with the tension, tension, tension
