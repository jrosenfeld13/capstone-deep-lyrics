When the saints go marching home
Oh, when the saints go marching home
Good Lord, I wants to be in that number
Oh, when the saints go marching home

And when the sun refuse to shine
And when the sun refuse to shine
Oh Lord, I wants to be in that number
Oh, when the sun refuse to shine

And when the moon run down in blood
And when the moon run down in blood
Oh Lord, I wants to be in that number
When the moon drips away in blood

When the saints go marching home
Oh, when the saints go marching home
Lord, I wants to be in that number
Oh, when the saints go marching home

Oh when the road is cold up yonder
Oh when the road is cold up yonder
Lord, I wants to be in that number
When the road is cold up yonder

And when the saints go marching home
When the saints go marching home
Lord, I wants to be in that number
When the saints go marching home

And when the saints go marching home
When the saints go marching home
Lord, I wants to be in that number
When the saints go marching home
