There was a black wedding
In this strange cold night
All the people laughed
But she she wished to die
She offered him her secrets
Gave all the love she had
And she sees herself dying
Lay naked on his bed
She will be his victim in this special night
She wll lose her beauty, she doesn't want to fight
She wants to be loved only for this moment
She could never win this lovely game of life
She offered him her secrets
Gave all the love she had
And she sees herself dying
Lay naked on his bed
He kissed her silver body
And smelled her warm red blood
But he can't listen to her
Can't hear her trembling heart
Her smile vanished when she looks into his eyes
All his sweet promises crumble to dust
She doesn't want to see this greed in his eyes
But her weak protest dries up in his lies
