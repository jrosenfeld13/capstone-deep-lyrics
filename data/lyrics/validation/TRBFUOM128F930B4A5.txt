I wish I had a telescope to guide this ship tonight
And a break of light bursting through the sand heavy sky
How do I get to you now?
I guess I'll have to learn how to swim
So I won't drown

I wish I had a little hope to help me feel alright
And a happy inside running through the sand heavy mind
How do I get to you now
Guess I'll have to learn how to breathe and work it out

And I'll float the waves of rolling tides
I'll set my pace by my time
And I'll get to you, I'll get to you
I'll get to you, my love

I'll float the waves of rolling tides
I'll set my pace by my time
And I'll get to you, I'll get to you
