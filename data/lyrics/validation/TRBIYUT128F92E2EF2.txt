Engel-Franz

It's funny
A million little things still run through my mind
The dream is, it's getting late
But time has left me behind
I find that everything I lived, I lived for you
Everything I did, I did for you
Youre gone again, and a young man cried for you
Your face I still see on a pillow
In a grey sleepy dawn
It's over, the cat's on that pillow
Wondering where the girls gone
I start to think about the things you used to say
I keep letting dreams get in my way
You're gone again, and a young man cried today
My own shadows surround me
They won't go away
I keep hearing your voice
And I cry out your name
You're gone again, and a young man cried today
