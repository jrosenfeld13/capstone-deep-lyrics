I've been waiting for a guy like you
You've been waiting to be my guy too
I'll go to Paris, see the lovers in the park
Try California walk the beaches in the dark

I'll see the world in my Levi Blues
But I'll always come back
I'll always come back to you

I've been waiting for a guy like you
You've been waiting to be my guy too
I'll go to China write "I Love You" on the Wall
And maybe London, catch a show at Albert Hall

I'll see the world in my Levi Blues
But I'll always come back
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you

He loves me, he loves me not
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been waiting for a guy like you
You've been waiting to be my guy too
In the Big Apple, where we both can take a bite
We'll have to hurry, 'cause we always miss our flight

We'll see the world in our Levi Blues
'Cause I always come back
I always come back to you

He loves me, he loves me not
Yeah, yeah, yeah
