Street corner trick
On sunset strip
Long legs red hair
With cross to bear
Fled to the west
In Sunday s best
New life to lead
Strive to succeed
Spit me out
Spit me out
Suck me back up again
The silver screen
Her lifelong dream
Vision denied
Time after time
Audition time
Another line
Use to abuse
She can't refuse

[Repeat Chorus:]
Underground film
Will pay the bills
Chasing the fix
Treats come with tricks
Turn for the worst
Drug money cursed
Against her will
Performance kills

[Repeat Chorus:]
