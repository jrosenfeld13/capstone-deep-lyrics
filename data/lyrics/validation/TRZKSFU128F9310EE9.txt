[Verse 1]
Everytime you point your finger
Three more point right back at you
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with life
Cause that's a sad excuse
And age old game of rat and mouse
Chasing us from house to house
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with you
It's wrong with me as well

[Chorus]
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
Amigone

[Verse 2]
Heavenly intoxication
Love's been marred by medication
Ain't it funny how a life can take a turn
When the end is near

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm not saying that it's nothing
I ain't going to play along
I ain't wishing for a miracle
That miracle's gone wrong
And you're too strong

[Chorus]
