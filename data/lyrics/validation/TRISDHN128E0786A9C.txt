She put the scar on the side of his face
When he disappeared for three days
And they say that they are in love

He took her cocaine when she was asleep
Friends say he gave half away
And they say that they are in love

Run away, run away
Run away, before it's too late

There is danger but they will not see
If they're blind then it's blind that they'd rather be

This town's destroyed more than one friend of mine
Funny, they never leave
They say that they are in love

Some say it's rotten, some say it's wrong
Some say it's hard to believe
And some say that they are in love

Move away, move away
Move away before it's too late

Then the lion sleeps with the lamb
Only love let's me forget who I really am

This land is small, it's cold and it's damp
There's no place that I'd rather be
I know that I am in love

Ethnic divisions, screaming demands
A little bit like you and me
I guess that we are in love

Stay away, stay away
Stay away, you might end up like me
It's the pain that keeps us alive
But that beauty is all that we need to survive
That damn beauty is all that we need to survive
