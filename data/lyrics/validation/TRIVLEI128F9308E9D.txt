From out of the darkness
Beneath the lights
Right there
Off of main street

The mystery takes control of a man
And it drops them to their knees
Makes me question who I am

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love, that ain't love!

On a warm, warm summer night
I feel a chill shake right through me
From my head down to the ground

You have become my fantasy
When no one else is around!

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love, that ain't love!

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love

You walk with a vengeance
And the clothes you wear
Are part of the spell that you cast

Like a watch on a chain
You hypnotize me

But I just, I just
Can't take a chance

I don't belong beneath the lights
Right there off of main street

Least now I know just who I am
It's not somewhere I want to be
When no one else is around

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love, that ain't love!

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love, that ain't love!

I've got to leave this place because
That ain't love, that ain't love!

That ain't love!
No, no, no!
That ain't love!
You're just a fantasy, baby!

That ain't love!
That ain't love!

What goes on down on main street
That ain't love!
That ain't love!

You're just a fantasy, baby!
That ain't love!

And you might not even be a woman!

No, no, no!
That ain't love!

Ewwwwwww!
