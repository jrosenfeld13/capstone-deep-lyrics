It was a late Thursday night
When I decided to write this song
Just me, bow wow, my dirty floor
All the herb is gone
Everyone's asleep
But the TV is still on
Debating the past 3 years
What I did right and wrong

So tell me is this world we live in alright?
Why does every conversation end in a fight?
Why does every fight keep us up all damn night?
Cause I ain't trying to see the sun rise today

I've been burning bridges
Always burning bridges

Just livin life
But do you know
At twenty-two
I've learned that i need to know
I've made mistakes
I've burned a bridge
Apologize? What?
There's only one life to live
When everybody's gone
And the radio's still on
That's when I realize
That's all I need to carry on

So tell me is this world we live in alright?
Why does every conversation end in a fight?
Why does every fight keep us up all damn night?
Cause I ain't trying to see the sun rise today

I've been burning bridges
Always burning bridges

I've been burning bridges
I'm looking at the loss this time
Always burning bridges
These last three years

Tell me is this world we live in alright?
Why does every conversation end in a fight?
Try to explain this life in black and white
Cause I'm gonna see the sun rise today

I've been burning bridges
Always burning bridges

I've been burning bridges
I'm looking at the loss this time
Always burning bridges
These past three years

I've been burning bridges
I'm looking at the loss this time
Always burning bridges
These past three years
