Take me to your dream
You're my only dear
Tell me the secrets that you keep
Into my ear

Our journey will be long
Your dreams has just begun
I'll whisper you some sweet song
Just leave my song

Just tell me what you can see
And can you ride the wind

It's sunshine and it's night
End of moonless sky
Tell me can you feel those butterflies
Dancing in your mouth

Just tell me what you can see
And can you ride the wind

Just tell me what you can see

Just tell me what you can see
And can you ride the wind [x3]
