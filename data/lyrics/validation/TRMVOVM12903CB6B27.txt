What's a matter with Christine, she' s going out of mind
She's gonna have a big trauma but she hasn't got the time
She's looking for that something, she don't know what it is
She's looking for that something that's gonna set her World on Fire

Gonna set her World on Fire set it on Fire
She works the same place I do I don't like my job at all
Don't know what she thinks of hers but I do Know its not a ball
She's looking for that something, she don't know what it is

She's looking for that something that's gonna set her World on Fire
Gonna set her World on Fire set it on Fire
What's a matter with Christine, she s going out of mind
She's gonna have a big trauma but she hasn't got the time

Were all looking for that something, we don't know what it is
Were looking for that something that's gonna set our World on Fire

Gonna Set our World on Fire
Gonna Set our World on Fire
Gonna Set our World on Fire
