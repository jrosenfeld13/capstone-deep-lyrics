Creature funkin', creature funkin

Maloke:
Have you ever had a human tryin' to take you for a walk?
So welcome in the creature shock
Ever feel like a dog in the bog even though you're a frog?
So make your eyes pop

Chorus:
Pumpin', pumpin' B.O.G
Jumpin', jumpin', Zoology
Easy come, easy go
Welcome to the freakshow
Puck off if you don't really think so

Pit:
I might as well be explainin you where to go, but ah
Bon't you expect me to judge yo indoor - Paranoia
I spit spells
Formed into rhymes like a Lama that's da story dat tells

Maloke:
They call M R dot M A L O C K
Cause we play in a puckin sandbox
All day slimy is the soup that we cook
So you can't read about us in zoology books

Pit:
Yeah books, dat tell all da stories
I think your mind was programmed in the laboratory
Sorry now it's time for da freak-show feature
Now go home to tell your mama or your teacher

Maloke:
Now ya snuck in the bleachers stuck
In the bleachers with two brains stuck
At the bottom of the food chain zoology
Is just misfit mythology if you wanna learn about it do it properly

Pit:
Yeah, we be spillin borderline thoughts in a speed that's iller
Yeah you heard it we's da party thriller

Maloke:
Fat bottom us lika a hippopotamus
Swamplife we be the amateur zoologists
Have you ever had a human try to take you for a walk
Ever feel like a dog in the bog even tho yer a frog

Chorus:
Humpin', pumpin' B.O.G
Jumpin', jumpin', Zoology
Easy come, easy go
Welcome to the freakshow
Puck off if you don't really think so

Creature funkin', creature funkin'

That's right! are you ready?
It's the hiphopnotist - come on!

HipHopnotist:
Mirror Mirror on the walls
Who's the Puppetmasta with the biggest balls
I'm sellin' HipHopnotist Dolls in Shopping Malls
Don't use phones but i'm answering your calls
I'm in your brain kicks i leave a bad taste
They don't call me HipHopnotist for nothing but they need another
Hyperthetically we be prouder
My mike's on peak, so you can hear me louder
It's getting hot in here, just turn it up, make it leap
While I hypnotize the beat, turning up the heat yo
Zoologically speakin' I reached the equallibrium
Mad ma pucker's be askin where he be from
The hiphopnotist
I'm just droppin' this
The hiphopnotist
The hiphopnotist
I'm just rockin' this

Maloke:
Mr. Malockin I ride a toboggan right into yer noggin' it's true
Flippin' the chickens I sicken the figgas who think that we live in a zoo

Pit:
We's organizin' rhymes like growin da leech-seeda
We don't need a leada or animal-feeda
