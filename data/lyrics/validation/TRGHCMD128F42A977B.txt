London mc
Rocking up your party
Number one mc
Don't play with me
I like to party
With all the sexy ladies
What is my name?
I tell you again
It's London mc
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)

This London mc and I'm rocking right now
I'm coming to your city
And I'm here to show you how
The badboy mc with the London voice
When I'm on the mc I'm the ladies' choice

Coming at the dance, I'm the messiah of the place
Watch all the girls dancing at the place
Them dogs do the place
Getting right now
Everybody's jamming to the mc sound

London mc
Rocking up your party
Number one mc
Don't play with me
I like to party
With all the sexy ladies
What is my name?
I tell you again
It's London mc
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)

Breaking down the lyrics in a way you understand
You rocking to the ebat in every town in the land
I'm coming right down with the London style
And when I'm on the microphone I make the people go wild
London mc's here and I'm coming with the vibe
You're jamming in you room and you're jamming in your ride
I have put the sound that the people wanna hear
I'm London mc, coming loud and clear

London mc
Rocking up your party
Number one mc
Don't play with me
I like to party
With all the sexy ladies
What is my name?
I tell you again
It's London mc
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)

(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
(London mc london mc london mc)

This music is for everybody in the world
It's the London mc floating sound
All around the world in each and every city
Bring the bass back

London mc
Rocking up your party
Number one mc
Don't play with me
I like to party
With all the sexy ladies
What is my name?
I tell you again
It's London mc
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
(Feel the feeling, feel the fire
London mc feel higher)
