You're seventeen
Evil and mean
Comfy and cozy, nowhere scene
You can't deny
The loser inside
All of your bad tastes won't subside

You're outta sight
You keep me up at night
You dress funny
Strapless and skintight
You're out of sight
You keep me up at night
You make me crazy
You wear it out of spite
Ban the tube top tonight!

You're magical
Mystery girl
Tank top, you don't stop a-rocking my world
You give high fives
To all the guys
You let me know that I'm alive

You're outta sight
You keep me up at night
You dress funny
Strapless and skintight
You're out of sight
You keep me up at night
You make me crazy
You wear it out of spite
Ban the tube top

There's a party that we're
Not invited to
But I don't care because
I hate everyone in school, oh oh
I ignore all the girls but you, oh yeah

Aw, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Beautiful girl
Ugly shirt
You are a fashion red alert
But I can't resist
You've never been kissed
I've never been in love like this

You're outta sight
You keep me up at night
You dress funny
Strapless and skintight
You're out of sight
You keep me up at night
You make me crazy
You wear it out of spite

You're outta sight
You keep me up at night
You dress funny
Strapless and skintight
You're out of sight
You keep me up at night
You make me crazy
You wear it out of spite
Ban the tube top
Ban the tube top
Ban the tube top tonight
Tonight, oh yeah, woo!

Ha ha, I'm sorry, I went to Mars for a second, but I'm back now and I've got T-shirts for everybody!
