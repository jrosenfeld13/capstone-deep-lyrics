Come with us
We're gonna make you feel alive
When the lights go down
Feel the fire burn inside

So you've had a rough year
Let's leave it in the dust
Tonight you're gonna shine
Tonight! Here with us

Don't ever let them make you feel small
Don't ever let them make you want to crawl
Don't let them make you feel incomplete
Don't let them make you feel obsolete

On our way
To devastate
Wall of sound
Sonic beatdown

Ride with us
Cause you know We're gonna take the lead
Make hairpin turns
Once again at lightning speeds

No barricades
Can stop this brutal force
No hurricane winds
Will knock us off course

Don't ever let them make you feel small
Don't ever let them make you want to crawl
Don't let them make you feel incomplete
Don't let them make you feel obsolete

On our way
To devastate
Wall of sound
Sonic beatdown

Ladies and Gentlemen
We need you to clear the area
Ladies and Gentlemen
We need you to clear the area
This is an unlawful gathering
This is an unlawful gathering
This is an unlawful gathering

Job well done
Now it's time to hit the road
Seek the next target
So again, We can unload

From the deepest trench
To the highest mountain peak
United
We'll never know defeat

On our way
To devastate
Wall of sound
Sonic beatdown

On our way
To detonate
Wall of sound
Sonic beatdown
