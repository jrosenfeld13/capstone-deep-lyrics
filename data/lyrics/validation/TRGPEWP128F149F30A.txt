[Verse 1]
Dear god, do you want to tear your knuckles down
And hold yourself
Dear god, can you climb off that tree
Meat in the shape of a 'T'

Dear god, the paper says
You were the King in the black limousine
Dear John and all the King's men
Can't put your head together again

[Chorus]
Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic and so are your brains

[Verse 2]
Dear god, the sky is as blue
As a gunshot wound
Dear god, if you were alive
You know we'd kill you

[Chorus]
Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic and so are your brains
