I've been searching for the truth behind
What the prophets have sealed
So exotic every faith I found
And beyond my ordeal
There's a very attractive appeal

I've been deep inside the human mind
Living under a ban
We've all come to know as space and time
No more top of the clan
I resign and accept
Who I am
I take pride in my religion today
I take pride in how I'm leading my way
I take pride in my religion today
Like diamonds found
On sacred ground
This is where I belong

Built my life on ideology
Get the principles right
Turned myself into a parody
I behaved so uptight
Nothing sacred to harbor in sight
What's the point with our society
With supply and demand
When the product left is misery
No more top of the clan
I resign and accept who I am

End of journey
Here's my fate complete
No more top of the clan
I resign and accept who I am
