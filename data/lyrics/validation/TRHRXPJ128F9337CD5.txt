The lights from the local strip flicker on
As the sun slinks down it calls it off
Another day, another way to sell some stuff

When life is so good, it hurts
It burns your eyelids and gets worse

Old friend, its common sense  use your head
Its so easy not to say what you meant
When those bright lights wont shine in your eyes again

When life is so good, it hurts
It burns your eyelids and gets worse
Oh, I will cut you in half
And then we'll see who laughs
