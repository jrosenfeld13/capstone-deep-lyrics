Guess you know by now or at least you should
There is no volunteer for the common good
Still waiting for the saviour to appear
But he's s not here
And no one's coming down to save your soul
You're the only ones who can assume that role
But your minds are empty and you've lost control
To the ones who sell you dreams
To fill that hole

Some of us I know seem to have much more
Born with a key to every door
Distribution of fortune seems unfair
Same everywhere
And those who have they just want more
Using other peoples weakness to increase their score
Do you really know who you're working for
It's not for one another and that s for sure

Guess you know by now or ac least you should
There is no volunteer for the common good
Still waiting for that saviour to appear
But he's still not here
And no one's s coming down to save your soul
You're the only ones who can assume that role
But your minds are empty
And you've lost control
To the ones who sell you dreams
To fill that hole
