It doesn't exist, you live in regret
I remember the kiss when we first met
I remember the sting as you finished me off
And I remember my face when you stopped and said
Kid, please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of it all with no command
And I said, "Please, try harder while you can"
I'm now required by love to be in command
You're stuck here with me and I'm stuck here with you
We'll walk through it all like we used to
And the things you'd forget when we live without fear
Ill broke on the road and I'll be here singing
Kid, please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of it all and all your plans
Can you please try harder while you can
I'm now required by love to hold your hands
You've been flashing white light from the palms on your hands
You were ready to fight or to land
You're so easily led, you didn't know how to dance
So that's all you want from romance
(Well, then, Kid)
Please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of a love with all your plans
I said, "Please, try harder while you can"
I'm now required by the law to hold your hand
Can you try? Come on, try
Come on, try, can we try?
Could you try? Could you try?
You were flashing white light from the palms of your hands
You were ready to fight or to land
You're so easily led you didn't know how to dance
But if that's all you want if this is all you want from romance
