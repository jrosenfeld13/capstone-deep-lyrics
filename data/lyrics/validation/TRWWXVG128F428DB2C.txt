[Intro]
My baby left this morning
With everything I had
She didn't give me no warning
And that's why I feel so bad
Oh, Anita!
Anita!
I need some sympathy
Anita!
I love ya!
Come and sit by me

[Verse 1]
That's a tape
That we made
But I'm sad to say
It never made the grade
That was me
Third guitar
I wonder where the others are

[Verse 2]
Vine Street
We used to live there
On Vine Street
She made perfume
In the back of her room
While me and my group
Would sit out on the stoop
And we'd play for her
The songs she liked best
To have us play
On Vine Street

[Verse 3]
Vine Street
The crack of the back beat
On Vine Street
Swingin' along
On the wings of a song
Lyin' secure
Self-righteous and sure
While we've things to say
If the people would pay
To have us play
On Vine Street
