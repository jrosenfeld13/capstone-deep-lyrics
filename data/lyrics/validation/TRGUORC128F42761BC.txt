Look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently

I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still, my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why
Nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how
Someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps

With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still, my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how
You were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
