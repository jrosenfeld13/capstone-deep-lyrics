[Verse 1]
Goin' through my closet the other day
I found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip
Down there on that Panama strip
We all started yellin' when we smelled the beach
Couldn't wait to try our fake IDs
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make

[Chorus]
Oh, man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

[Verse 2]
This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin' to granddad
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again

[Chorus]
Oh, man, we were livin
Sittin' there reminiscin'
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried

[Bridge]
It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad

[Verse 3]
Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile
And I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you
Comin' in and tellin me the news

[Outro]
Oh, man, we were livin'
Goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried
