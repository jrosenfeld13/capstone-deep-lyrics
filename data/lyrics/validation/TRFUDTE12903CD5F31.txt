No matter what words i say
She just thinks it's my best line
She'll look at me that way and say
Yeah she'll say

Boys lie
Thanks guys
You've really done it for me this time
Now i'm watching her walk away

I'm not like all the others
I get lost inside your eyes
And it comes as no surprise
That still she won't believe me
She's heard it a hundred times
She'll just look at me and say

Boys lie
Thanks guys
You've really done it for me this time
Now i'm watching her walk away

I'm paying for her past because the last guy didn't last
I'm stuck in the middle
Of this riddle so cruel
There's no point to argue
'cause you know as well as i do that it's true

Crazy
That we
Will never be happy
So much time invested
You and me and
All this wishful thinking
So much time you wasted

I get lost in your eyes
While you just look for the lies
