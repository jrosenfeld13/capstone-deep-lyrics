Hello railroad, is this the railroad?
I want a one way ticket down to Tennessee
I'm leaving immediately, Chattanooga, here I come

Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Right on track 29, boy, you can give me a shine
I can afford to board the Chattanooga choo choo
I've, I've, I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare

You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina

When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rolling
Whoo, whoo, Chattanooga, there you are

There's gonna be a certain party at the station
In, in satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home?

Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I'm a comin' back to Tennessee
Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I want a one way ticket on the
Chattanooga choo choo train

Hey, pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo choo choo?
Right on track 29, my baby, I'm fine
Boy, you can give me a shine
Give me a very good shine

There's gonna be a certain party at the station
All dressed up in satin and lace, oh, what a funny face
(I used to call funny face)
I used to call her just a funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home!?
