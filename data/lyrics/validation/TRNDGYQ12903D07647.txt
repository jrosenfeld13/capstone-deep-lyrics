[Verse 1]
All I hope is that you forgive me
And understand how I feel
All I wanted to do was tell you what was true
But it had its effects, I could tell

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's in broken pieces
But I don't pity myself 'cause I'm to blame

[Chorus]
I couldn't carry on this way
When all I wanted was to stay
It took its toll on me
And I will never forget
No, I will never pretend
It meant nothing to me

[Verse 2]
But you weren't the only thing here
But you weren't the only thing that mattered to me
But even when I had to go away
You were always on my mind
But that wasn't enough for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's in broken pieces
But I don't pity myself 'cause I'm to blame

[Chorus]
I couldn't carry on this way
When all I wanted was to stay
It took its toll on me
And I will never forget
No, I will never pretend
It meant nothing to me

[Bridge]
All of this has to end
All of this has to end

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's in broken pieces
But I don't pity myself 'cause I'm to blame

[Chorus]
I couldn't carry on this way
When all I wanted was to stay
It took its toll on me
And I will never forget
No, I will never pretend
It meant nothing to me

All of this has to end
All of this has to end

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's in broken pieces
But I don't pity myself 'cause I'm to blame

[Chorus]
I couldn't carry on this way
When all I wanted was to stay
It took its toll on me
And I will never forget
No, I will never pretend
It meant nothing to me

[Outro]
All of this has to end
It took it's tool on me
