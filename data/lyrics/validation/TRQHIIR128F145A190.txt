[Intro]
Time waits for no man but you
Time waits for no man but you
Hold on, don't leave this town
Hold on, don't leave this town

[Verse 1]
Here we are with art in our hands
They tear you down 'cause they don't understand
You tried it once again to love me better
She tore those panties down and loved me wetter

[Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door

[Verse 2]
To hold them down with blood on your hands
Is past the point where you don't understand
The worst you do is lie when you run for shelter
So cast aside these chains and love me better

[Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
