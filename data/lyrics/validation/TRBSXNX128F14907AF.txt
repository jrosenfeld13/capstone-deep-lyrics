You've got to look deep inside
Because it's the safest place to hide
Outside there is a battle
One that I'll miss if you don't tattle
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow
I'm not so bored, not even crazy
I don't want to make decisions any more
Because I'm lazy
I'm waiting for the right guy
I'm so tired of using my own mind
Or could it be a special girl
I'm just looking for the leader of the world
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow
I'm not so bored, not even crazy
I don't want to make decisions any more
Because I'm lazy
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow
I've got to follow
I've got to follow
I've got to
I've got to
I've got to
I've got to
I've got to
