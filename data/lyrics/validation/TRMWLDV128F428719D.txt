I've been torn apart since I met you
Don't know how I'll see it through
Troubled times are on their way
Wish that you could stay

Now and then
I feel like giving up
Instead I'll cry
Alone
And wonder why

Friends tell me I'm acting like a fool
The way we live breaks all the rules
The lies I tell don't seem so strange
Wake me up, I'll change

Now and then
I feel like giving up
Instead I'll cry
Alone
And just say goodbye

Love, I can't believe my lies drove you away
Love, I can't believe believe I made you feel this way

Last time that I looked into your eyes
Telling lies that made you cry
Troubled times are on their way
Wish that you could stay

Now and then
I feel like giving up
Instead I'll cry
Alone
And wonder why

Love, I can't believe my lies drove you away
Love, I can't believe I made you feel this way

Now and then
Now and then
Love
I feel like giving up
