[Verse 1]
I must have been confused or vain
To let this evil in my brain
Lord did I enjoy the change
That You made inside my heart?

[Bridge]
Oh here they come
I'm not afraid
There's no temptation I can't evade

[Hook]
Stand up straight
I look through the haze
I begin to walk
Through the maze
Here they come
They're all up on me
But I'm dead to sin
Like some kind of zombie
I hear You speak and I obey (Some kind of zombie)
I walk away from the grave (Some kind of zombie)
I will never be afraid (Some kind of zombie)
I gave my life away

[Verse 2]
I'm obliged and obey
I'm enslaved to what you say

[Bridge]

[Hook x2]
