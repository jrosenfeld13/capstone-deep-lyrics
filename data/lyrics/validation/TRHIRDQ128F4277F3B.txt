[Verse 1]
Hey mom, they left me here alone
Someone save me, someone save me
Hey god, I'm out here on my own
So now will you save me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's funny you've been quiet for so long
When you're quiet, no one proves you wrong
And dear your holiness
Your army's safe and sound (army's safe and sound)
They're down here dying for you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
Maybe you can trick a lot of them
Maybe if you fool the best of them
The rest will come around

[Verse 2]
We're all scared
So they dressed you up in all these
Different names
I've gotta find peace with myself
Before I give you all
Before I give you anything at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's funny you've been quiet for so long
When you're quiet, no one proves you wrong
And dear your holiness
Your army's safe and sound (army's safe and sound)
They're down here dying for you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
Maybe you can trick a lot of them
Maybe if you fool the best of them
The rest will come around (around)

[Bridge]
Been thinking that there's something more
And that you'd come down and you tell me yourself
Now I realize it's a waste of time
Another penny thrown down the well

[Outro]
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
(Dear your holiness, your army's safe and sound)
And I don't know how they found me, found me here
(Dear your holiness, your army's safe and sound)

Maybe you can trick a lot of them
Maybe if you fool the best of them
They'll come around
