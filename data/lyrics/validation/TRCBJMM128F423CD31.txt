[Verse 1]
New horizons are calling you
But they're so very far away
Good intentions are making it through
Getting harder and harder each day

Not just because I've known you so long
Not just because for me you've been strong
Not just because I see what you can do
Because I believe in you

[Chorus]
And when you need someone to care
I'm going to be right there with you
When you need someone to share
I'm going to be waiting there
Right here
Right now
The right time
The right day
The right place you'll find
That you'll need someone to care
I'm going to be standing there

[Verse 2]
To the sound of a distant drum
All your chances go walking by
You are different from everyone
No time to be hypnotized

Not just because I've known you so long
Not just because for me you've been strong
Not just because I see what you can do
It's all part of loving you

[Chorus]
And when you need someone to care
I'm going to be right there with you
When you need someone to share
I'm going to be waiting there
Right here
Right now
The right time
The right day
The right place you'll find
That you'll need someone to care
I'm going to be standing there

[Outro]
When you need someone to care
I'm going to be right there with you
When you need someone to share
I'm going to be waiting there
Right here
Right now
The right time
The right day
The right place you'll find
Right here
Right now
The right time
The right day
The right place you'll find
That you'll need someone to care
I'm going to be standing there
