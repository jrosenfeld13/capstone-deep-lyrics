[Verse 1]
In the elevator
I pick my floor
And if I want to battle
I pick my war

[Chorus]
Hold tight
Hold on
Hold tight
I was blind for a time
Now I find
The choice is mine

[Verse 2]
And I get seasick
On dry land
And I hear voices
Saying "Do what you can"

[Chorus x2]
Hold tight
Hold on
Oh
I was blind for a time
Now I find
That the choice is mine

[Outro]
The choice is mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The choice is mine
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
