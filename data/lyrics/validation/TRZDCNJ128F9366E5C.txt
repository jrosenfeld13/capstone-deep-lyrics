[Verse 1:]
Hey Father
I want to put you to an end
Hey Father
I'm almost over it again
Hey Father
You were never my friend
Hey Father
I've lost my mind again

[Chorus:]
Officer
What will you do?
Officer
I'll pay you

I'll pay you to shoot him now
I will you pay you to take him out
I will pay you to shoot him now
I'll pay you to blow his brains out

[Verse 2:]
Hey Mother
Did he hurt you again?
Hey Mother
I want you in
It's got to end

Hey Mother
Swallow your pride
You know it's true
Hey Mother
You know he hurt me too

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
(My sanity's lost now)
To choke him now
(The sad times are over)
To fuck him up
(I've taken control now)
To make him drink
From the same dried cup

Hey Father
I wanna put you to an end
Hey Father

[Repeat Chorus:]
