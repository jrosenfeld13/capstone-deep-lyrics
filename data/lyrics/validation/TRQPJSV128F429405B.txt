Jackie Wilson said
It was "Reet-Petite"
Kind of love you got
Knock me off my feet
Let it all hang out
Oh, let it all hang out

And you know
I'm so wired up
Don't need no coffee in my cup
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Watch this

[Pre-Chorus]
Ding-a-ling-a-ling
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-ding
Ding-a-ling-a-ling
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-ding
Do-da-do-da-doo

[Chorus]
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven
When you smile
When you smile
When you smile
When you smile

And when you walk
Across the room
You make my heart go
Boom, boom, boom
Let it all hang out
Baby, let it all hang out

And every time
You look that way
Honey child, you make my day
Let it all hang out
Like the man said
Let it all hang out
Watch this

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
