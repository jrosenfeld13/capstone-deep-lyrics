J. Ingram/T. Snider

I see you looking and I know what you think
Youre getting braver with every drink but
I am telling you something you need to know

She may look like a sweet young thing
Talking to him but she aint hearing a thing
If you were smart youd turn around and let her go

That girls a Barbie doll
A Barbie doll
Shes real good-looking but shes got no heart at all

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her
Boyfriends old mans brand-new car
Shes got no idea what she does or why

She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best
Nobody I know has ever seen her cry

(Chorus)
You should have seen her last Saturday night
She had a friend of mine treating her right
She was hanging on him until she found a better deal

You should have seen how cold she got
My buddy asked why and she said why not
Nobody I know swears shes even real

(Chorus)
