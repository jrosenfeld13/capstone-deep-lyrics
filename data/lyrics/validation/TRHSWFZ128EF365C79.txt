Our curious leader knows what's best
How we're signal bound now to existential sex
Our curious leader has such a lovely daughter
We wash their feet and quench our thirst with the same water

Our curious leader, he's never there
He's playing second fiddle to sumptuous despair
Our curious leader is covered in deep sin
And when I grow up you know I want to be like him

Our curious leader reads every dream
In the church of man and bomb and beast and TV and machine
The usual angels will add to your failures
Stand up, be counted, Buy Bailey's Trailers

Our curious leader has ransacked the loft
He's under the impression we have all gone soft
Our curious leader has emptied the larder
Pain is tough going but happiness is harder
