Deep in the heart of Texas
Sally, the water runs dust
You let me Sally
You danced awhile I held you in my arm
Then in the morning
Yes, the sun did come
I saw big old daddy - big old shotgun
The preacher with his wedding songs for us

I eat nothing but a country singer
I got no chains, no ring upon my finger
Got the open road
Thought I heard it call me then
And I could hang for the things I done
Well that's okay I had my fun
You only go around once
So go away sweet Sally

Deep in the belly of a Texas prison
The chain gang humdrum
And a slop sink kitchen
There's a cookie with a sweetened eye for me
Bout every morning as the sun does come
I see big old warden - big old shotgun
And a preacher with his wedding songs for us

I guess I'll never be a country singer
I got these chains, no rings upon my finger
I got a hanging rope and a preacher when I die
And I could hang for the things I've done
Well that's okay I had my fun
You only go around once
So go away sweet Sally

I guess I'll hang for the things I've done
Well that's okay I had my fun
You only go around once
Go away sweet Sally
