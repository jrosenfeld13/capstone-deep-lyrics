[Verse 1]
Little girl kisses her mom
Tells her I love you
Holds on to her hand
Little girl doesn't have much
She walks with a smile
She's so full of life

[Pre-Chorus]
But she cries in the night
Just to try to hold on
No one can hear her
She's all alone

[Chorus]
This little girl closes her eyes
All that she wants
Is someone to love
Someone to love

[Verse 2]
Little girl
She's all grown up
Oh she's getting famous
She's a big star
Oh little girl
Fights with her mom
Can't believe money
Changed who she loved

[Pre-Chorus]
But she cries in the night
Just to try to hold on
No one can hear her
She's all alone

[Chorus]
This little girl closes her eyes
All that she wants
Is someone to love, oh yeah
Someone to love, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She cries in the night
Just to try to hold on
No one can hear her
She's all alone

[Chorus]
This little girl closes her eyes
All that she wants
Is someone to love (Someone)
Someone to love (Someone)
To love (Someone)
To love (Someone)
Someone, someone, someone...
