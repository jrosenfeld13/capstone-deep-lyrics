How did you find a way to break my heart
You hit it like a shootin star
And now it's burning
That mark, I still remember every word
I don't believe what you were saying I tired to sleep it all
I hope you know I still remember all the words
Falling down everything is falling down
I'm feeling like I'm losing ground
Guess it only kill me better
Falling down where am I gonna go from here
Do you really care I guess it doesn't really matter now
Cause I'm falling down
I thought everything would always be
We used to fit perfectly
Pen and paper
Black lines circling around your heart
You built a wall to protect it
But you kept out all my love
I hope that you know that it won't give you any fair
Falling down everything is falling down
I'm feeling like I'm losing ground
Guess it only kill me better
Falling down where am I gonna go from here
Do you really care I guess it doesn't really matter now
Cause I'm falling down completely and you're nowhere
Why did you leave me badly out of breath now?
