My love
When I think I think of all the
Good times that we shared
Many places, many promises we had
And now it seems it's over and I know
Feeling that you're never coming home
And I'll be going on without you in my world

I know we never planned for love
To turn out quite this way
The way we started out that
One September day

The first time that I ever saw your face
My lonely heart was
Searching empty places
I miss your warm embrace
I need you here today

And this is my prayer for you

No matter how much you think it's over
And this I will swear to you
That I will be loving you forever
And I know you have to go on your own
To find your way back home

If my love had the power
To turn back the hands of tie
I would cherish
Every moment you were mine
And now it seems it's over and I know
I didn't know how much I loved you so
Now I'm so all alone without
You in my world

Today I though of you and me and
I began to pray
I prayed Allah would bring you back
To me someday
And you will stay forever in my heart
No matter where you are
Now matter how far
I'll come running back to you
I'm so in love with you
