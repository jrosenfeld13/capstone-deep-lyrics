[Vocals: Robert Forster]

If the cliffs were any closer
If the water wasn't so bad
I'd dive for your memory
On the rocks and the sand

I'd dive for you
Like a bird I'd descend
Deep down I'm lonely
And I miss my friend

So when I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

We stood side by side
Strong and true
I just wish you'd remember
Bad times don't get you through

When I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

Now I dive black waters
The waters of her dream
Are black and forgetful
I'd like to make them clean

So when I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance

So when I hear you saying
That we stood no chance
I'll dive for your memory
We stood that chance
