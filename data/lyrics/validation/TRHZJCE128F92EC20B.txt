[Intro]
One, two, three, four, five, six
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
Looking at the barrel of an Armalite
I don't want to spend the rest of my days
Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say
I don't want to spend my time in hell
Looking at the walls of a prison cell
I don't ever want to play the part
Of a statistic on a government chart

[Chorus]
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done

[Verse 2]
It's dark all day and it glows all night
Factory smoke and acetylene light
I face the day with me head caved in
Looking like something that the cat brought in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And they're only going to change this place
By killing everybody in the human race
They would kill me for a cigarette
But I don't even want to die just yet

[Chorus]
