Alone in a room I've been in once before
Shapes in the hall I'm running for the door
I'm out on the edge but I'm not defeated yet
I hear my name above everything else
Mark! Mark! Above everything else
Don't fall
To this freak out
Nothing's familiar
And nothing seems to fit into the scheme of things
Seeing faces where there shouldn't be faces
No-one's really certain what tomorrow brings
Don't fall my friend
This nightmare never ends
Hiding inside a room that's running red
The place to be exists only in your head
And the focus of fear in the creases of a dress
A female dress
How did I come to be drowning in this mess
Ahh! Fuckin' mess
Don't fall
To this freak out
Nothing's familiar

(Rest of chorus)
Don't fall
I know your back's against the wall
But this roaring silence won't devour us all
Freak out nothing's familiar
Something's rearranged the scheme of things
Mistakes don't matter
