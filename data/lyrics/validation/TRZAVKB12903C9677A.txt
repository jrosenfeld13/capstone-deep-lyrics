Oh Lovely Divine
I cannot describe You, I will not deny You
Three Beauties entwined
I will not disguise You, I cannot divide You

CHORUS
And Trinity, You gave to me
All that love could ever be
And I intend to show
That who You are brings life to me
My soul You saved in unity
That's all I need to know

It's all I need to know

Oh Holy Divine
I sing of Your wonders and what I've discovered
The mystery I find
There's none that compares to, nor will I dare to

REPEAT CHORUS

It's all I need to know

Now faith, faith and trust, is how I can hope for
What I do not see
So let, let reason kneel, kneel in surrender
In surrender, in surrender (to my Lord)

And Trinity, you gave to me

REPEAT CHORUS

Three Beauties entwined
I will not disguise You, I cannot divide You
