With overwhelming power and overwhelming lies
We've seen so many times before
The final moral crusade of the chosen ones
Against the infidels' uproar

Whatever the name, whatever the shape
Your era has come to an end
All that you've feared, a thousand times more
It's too late to make amends

Nothing will be the same anymore
Nothing will be the same

You never expected this to happen
This you could not foresee
To be struck straight in your heart
By this feeble enemy

Nothing will be the same anymore
Nothing will be the same

We're the heretics
Babylon's whores
And we become the undefeated
The boy that slays his lord
