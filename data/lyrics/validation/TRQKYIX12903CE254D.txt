Im scared outta my mind, wanna break down and cry
Cause I dont know if my dreams could be as faithful as I
Am to my work, to my life, to my profession
And everything inside of my life a real lesson yeah
Dont think that I got it what it takes, what I need I will make, and when Im made I will be great yeah
Kurt Cobain really rollin' in his grave cause the smell of teenagers these days is really stank yeah
I'm growin up and I just dont know how to function
Cause thoughts of missing the music is just repulsin
As soon as I heard that first note
On that track I will grow
And I dont wanna repeat the flow
But
I just gotta get something out there
Out there drifting off to light years
Cause the more I wait, the more I disappear
The truth is that always waitins my biggest fear

The youth is ruling I can see it all over
But how long until the youthfulness is over
When the king of teens can really wake up sober
And realize that hes over forty forty, yeah

Thats why I gotta do it when Im young
No attachments, just doing it for fun
And satan island man thats where Im from
And I will never be over it, never done

This shit is frustrating if I'm just being honest
And i dont wanna be a rapper, no i cant define
Its something greater, and pray to god that I can find it
Cause wasting time on stupid bullshit is just fucking mindless

And it took a lot for me to put this little track out
Its kinda hard when spineless people take my fuckin back out
Theyre all just sick and fuckin losers call em fuckin mad cow
And Im not doing this shit, so I can fuckin cash out

Im doing this cause I can feel it in my soul
These lyrics printed on the inside I must show
And I hope I get the chance, that I can grow
Cause I know this is my purpose, yes I know

The music that's right inside me, I gotta let it surface
Or itll tear me up apart just like a awful surgeon
No I dont needa wear a mask no Im not fuckin purging
I will forever be myself and wear all thats imperfect

And when you listen to my music, have a dream
That itll make you feel, and raise your self esteem
I hope you feel that light, just let it beam
I hope you love it, hope its what you need
