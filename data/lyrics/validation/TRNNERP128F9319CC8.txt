Everyday there's something you have started
Electrifying like I'm struck for losses
Hey, how you been, your emotion
It's like another craze
(Don't you know I love it)
(Can't get enough of it)

Your love has a way of applying satisfaction
Well, let me tell you our love is friction
Between us, baby, yeah
You've got a head start
(Don't you know I love it)
(Can't get enough of it)

Ah hah ooh, yeah
Ah hah ooh ooh, oh baby
Ah hah ooh, yeah
Don't you know I love it
Can't get enough of it

Your acts of peace is what we're aiming for
But with you baby, everyday is war
But now it's over
You've got the white flag of love
(Don't you know I love it)
(Can't get enough of it)

Your love has a way of applying satisfaction
Well, let me tell you our love is friction
Between us, baby, yeah

She really loves him
Can't get enough of his great sweet loving
Tell you what, tell you what
She's always thinking
He's slack so get back, now
He's really something

I can't right overall but keep up when I hear
They think I'm so proud of this soul cavalier
Hey, how you been, your emotion
It's all been natural
(Don't you know I love it)
