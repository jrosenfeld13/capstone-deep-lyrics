[Hook]
Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
Honor to love you

[Hook]
Still I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind

You've got this look I can't describe
You make me feel like I'm alive
When everything else is au fait
Without a doubt you're on my side
Heaven has been away too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Oh...
Your love

[Hook]
Still I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind

Now I have come to understand
The way it is
It's not a secret anymore
Cause we've been through that before
From tonight I know that you're the only one
I've been confused and in the dark
Now I understand

[Hook]
I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
I wonder why it is
I won't let my guard down
For anyone but you
We do it all the time
Blowing out my mind

[Hook]
Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
