[Verse 1]
Jesus just left Chicago
And He's bound for New Orleans
Well now, Jesus just left Chicago
And He's bound for New Orleans
Working from one end to the other
And all points in between

[Chorus 1]
Took a jog through Mississippi
Well, muddy water turned to wine

Took a jog through Mississippi
Well, muddy water turned to wine
Yeah..

[Verse 2]
Then I out to California through the forests and the pines
Oh, take me with You, Jesus

[Chorus 2]
You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same

You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same

[Outro]
You don't have to worry
Because taking care of business is his name
