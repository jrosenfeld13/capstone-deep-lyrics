Would you stand up for me?
So I can see everything
What's making you scream?
Are you breathing?
Is it what you're seeing?

[Chorus]
Come on
Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole life
Thinking that it's over
...are you breathing?

When you gave up on me
Were you happy?
Could you ever be?
Was it making you mean?
It's just a dream...
Just a dream

[Chorus]
Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole life
Thinking that it's over
...are you breathing?

Sometimes I get so lost and I can't fight but who i trust and
What's life or a dream?
What's life or a dream?

I ran away to tell the world
And everyday, everyday, everyday...
I ran away to tell the world
That I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Come on
Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole life
Thinking that it's over
You went and spent your whole life waiting for your whole life
Thinking that it's
Come on
Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole
Thinking that it's alright
Waiting for you whole life
You can spend your whole life
Waiting for youre whole life
Thinking that it's over, over
That it's over, over
