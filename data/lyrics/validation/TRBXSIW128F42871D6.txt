This temperamental side
The one you say that you can't hide
D' you ever see yourself -
The way it looks to someone else?
This temperamental trick
The one you say you can't predict
You're like an empty cup
Forgive me if I don't wait up
I don't get where you're coming from -
What is real and what's put on
What has stayed and what has gone
How long will this thing go on and on?

I don't want you to love me
I don't want you to love me

You're like an empty cup
But I can't fill you up
What planet are you on?
Not the same one I am from
Do I just waste my time?
You pour your heart on mine
You say it screws you up
Forgive me if I don't wait up
I don't get what you're trying to say -
What is wrong and what's okay
You beat yourself up one more time
You trample on this fierce heart of mine

I don't want you to love me
I don't want you to love me

I don't know what you want from me
All this endless sympathy
You beat yourself up one more time
You trample on this fierce heart of mine

I don't want you to love me
I don't want you to love me
