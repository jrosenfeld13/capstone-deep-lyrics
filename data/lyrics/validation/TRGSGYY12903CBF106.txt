There've been too many leavings to list in one place
Too many arrivals to ever retrace
And those have wandered haven't fallen from grace
Just done a few things they would like to erase
And met with their shadows face to face

Up, on the ridge top the coy dog cries
It's mother, a coyote with bright yellow eyes
A coy dog's half friendly, the other half wild
Half is homebody and half is streetwise
It can't help its nature and but God knows it tries

Star light, star bright
All the dogs are restless tonight
Leave on the porch light
I'll be home after midnight

It's all blessed and restless and up for debate
A season, a chance to alter a fate
But a moment can pass just because it can't wait
And time hits you hard with a terrible weight
Like a rock to the forehead stamped with 'Too Late'

Star light, star bright
All the dogs are restless tonight
Leave on the porch light
I'll be home after midnight

Our vision's often faulty
We see but through the glass darkly
And yet we know deep down
When we hear the sound
When it speaks our name

The moon eats its center until it dissolves
Then conquers the shadow with a single resolve
Here's to hoping for wholeness no matter how small
Asking the questions that cannot be solved
And following the ache of unnamable call

Star light, star bright
All the dogs are restless tonight
Leave on the porch light
I'll be home after midnight
I'll be home after midnight
I'll be home after midnight
