What is wrong with this world today?
The more you try the less they care
Who waves the flag of originality?
Judge and jury over everything

I got all the reasons to remain in my position
What the hell is that which really triggers them to criticize?
Even if they're blind they know what's wrong and what is right
But stronger is my conviction when I look into their eyes
See their faces of hipocrisy
The shame they feel cause they're just "wannabes"
Point a finger and laugh at them
If you think this sucks...you're one of us!
Fuck you!

Can't you tell?
The whole stage is indebted to us; we owe'em shit
We took them outta mediocrity
These chords cut with determination aliong the putrid flesh
Trimminmg all the rotten roots that ate the tree away

I got all the reasons to remain in my position
What the hell is that which redally triggers them to criticize?
Even if they're blind they know what's wrong and what is right
But stronger is my conviction when I look into their eyes
See their faces of hypocrisy
The shame they feel cause they're just "wannabes"
Point a finger and laugh at them
If you think this sucks...You're one of us!
