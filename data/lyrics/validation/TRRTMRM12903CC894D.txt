All along the road of life I roam
Lookin' for a place to call my own
Not a fancy mansion or a bungalow for me
But ev'rywhere I go I seem to find
Hangin' on the door that same old sign
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door, "No Vacancy."

[Chorus:]
No Vacancy, No Vacancy --
All along the line it's the same old sign waitin' for me
No Vacancy, No Vacancy --
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door
"No Vacancy."

Not so long ago when the bullets screamed
Many was the happy dream I dreamed
Of a little nest where I could rest when the world was free
Now the mighty war over there is won
Troubles and trials have just begun
Facing that terrible enemy sign, "No Vacancy."

[Chorus]

Brother, if you live a life of ease
Better take a moment on your knees;
Thank the Lord above for all His love, then think of me
Livin' in a world of greed and hate
Hoping ev'ry day the hand of fate
Will remove that sign that's a-hangin' on the door, "No Vacancy."

[Chorus]
