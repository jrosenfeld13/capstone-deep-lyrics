She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over
Wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the Beast before
But she left there wanting more and more

But when she was walking
On down the road
She heard a sound that
Made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back:
"I'll take you on a ride
From here to eternity!"

[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one
Of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
I've made her feel like
She's on cloud nine
She even thought
She heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte
They were two of a kind
They'd always take the line
From here to eternity

[Chorus][x2]

[Spoken: Bruce Dickinson]
Yes ah, yeah like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines!

[Chorus][x2]

"Get on your M11, get on your bike!"
Ha ha ha ha ha!
