Well if you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need
If you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need
If you want it God's got it
He got everything you need
He got every everything
A poor man needs

Walking around like a vagabond
Troubles are on your back
Looking for money, looking for friends
And you don't know who to ask

Well if you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need
If you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need

If you want it God's got it
He got everything you need
He got every everything
A poor man needs

I believe in the Lord above
I believe in the righteous i believe in love
I believe in the the fire burning in my soul
I believe that his light is going to make me whole

Well if you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need
If you want it God's got it
He's got everything you need
Well if you need it now God's got it now
He's got everything a poor man needs
God's got it, he's got it.....
