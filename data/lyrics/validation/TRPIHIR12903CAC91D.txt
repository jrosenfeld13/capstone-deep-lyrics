Got new boots and lipstick
Got the rest of my life to buy things that I don't need
Got problems aplenty
Got hope in a jar by my bedside
Got angels looking down on me

I can't strain my brain
Can't take the blame for everything I don't know
I lock the door and at the end of the day

I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, no no
Just one more thing I could do without, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out

Those sheeple, with notebooks
So unique, thinking the same
Same haircuts, same club, same name
Televisions, politicians, mentalism, evangelism, stupidism
Always drugging the nation
Keep falling for that same game

I can't strain my brain
Can't take the blame for everything you don't know
I lock the door and at the end of the day

I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, no no
Just one more thing I could do without, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out

It's really nothing, but I'm not coming out to play
I'm sure it's nothing, but I'm not coming out today

I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out, no no
Just one more thing I could do without, woo
I'm tired and I just don't want to go out
