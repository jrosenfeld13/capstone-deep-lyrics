A little white house, in the heart of town
On a little sad street, just a little run down
Became a home, for Bill and Sue
Two newlyweds, who did the best that they could do
And when they brush each other, passin' in the hall
Sue would smile and say: "This place is pretty small

But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this

Before too long, Sue and Bill
Were makin' plans, for Jack and Jill
Oh, happy day, when the news came in
But what to do, when they found out Sue was having twins
When they could not pass each other in the hall
Well, Sue would smile and say: "This place is really, really small

But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this

That little white frame house still keeps them warm
Though it's been thirty-two years, since the kids were born
And when they look back now, they hold each other tight
And whisper in each other's ears: "You know you were right

Because love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this

Yeah, love grows best, in houses just like this
