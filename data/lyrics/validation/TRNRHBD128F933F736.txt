In the morning they found him there, he'd passed in the night
No-one there to hold his hand, he's alone
His room is filled with memories, echoes of his life
Will he be remembered, he's gone

He looks down: he sees himself, lying there and wonders at the sight
He looks again: he knows it's time
For him to go and that will make it right
Into the Light, Into the Light

At the graveside no-one there, who will shed a tear?
The Priest will speak his words aloud, to God
His mind is full of broken dreams: he will take them on
To the ones that passed before, his time

He looks down: he sees himself, lying there and wonders at the sight
He looks again: he knows it's time
For him to go and that will make it right
Into the Light, Into the Light

I am the Resurrection and the Life said the Lord
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
We commend to Almighty God, our brother James
And we commit his body to the ground
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The Lord bless him and keep him
The Lord lift up His countenance upon him and give him peace!
He looks down: he sees himself, lying there and wonders at the sight
He looks again: he knows it's time
For him to go and that will make it right
Into the Light, Into the Light
He will go on... Into the Light!
