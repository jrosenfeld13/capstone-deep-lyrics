Chris
In a place that won't let us feel
In a life where nothing seems real
I have found you
I have found you

Kim
In a world that's moving to fast
In a world where nothing can last
I will hold you
I will hold you

Chris
Our lives will change when tomorrow comes

Kim
Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums

Chris
And we'll have music all right
Tearing the night

Chris & Kim
A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound
A lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me to hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

Chris
On the other side of the earth
There's a place where life still has worth
I will take you

Kim
I'll go with you

Chris
You won't believe all the things you'll see
I know cause you'll see them all in me

Chris & Kim
If we're together that's when
We'll hear it again
A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound
A lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me to hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

Kim
Dreams were all I ever knew

Chris
Dreams, you won't need when I'm through

Chris & Kim
Anywhere
We may be
I will sing with you, a song...
So stay with me and hold me tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world
