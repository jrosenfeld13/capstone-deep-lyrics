Won't you smile, you look so shocked
Put the name tag on your smock
We've come to see you, Eddie Walker
We may pack a little tight, the girl up front says, it's alright
And look there's more of us still getting off the bus
We wish you'd come back home with us
Eddie Walker, this is your life
This ones you when you were small
And you're learnin' how to walk
They'd pick you up and you keep falling down
There you are with Aunt Louise, you're bouncing on her knees
Remember all those trees behind the garden
They're gone, oh, they all got cut down when she died
Eddie Walker, this is your life, you never had a son or a wife
You sure had a hell of a time, oh, Eddie Walker, this is your life
This one's you and Mary Jo
Well, she couldn't come, she says, hello
No, Eddie Walker and she doesn't hate your guts
It's just the whole thing's shook her up
How they picked you up and you kept falling down
Eddie Walker, this is your life, no, Eddie Walker, this is your life
You never had a coat or a tie, you never had a reason to cry
An' this whole stack and all of these
Are just a mist or overseas
We're gonna leave you, Eddie Walker
