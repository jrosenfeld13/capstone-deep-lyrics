[Verse 1]
He was standing at the rock
Gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch
It turned into a march
And there he found the spark to set this fucker off

[Chorus 1]
Set it off, set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off, set it off now children
Alright
Set it off, set it off now children
Set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

[Verse 2]
Suddenly a shot
Ripped into his heart
And he lay in need of some attention
And there he played his card
Going into shock
The last thing that he said was, set this fucker off

[Chorus 1]
Set it off, set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off, set it off now children
Alright
Set it off, set it off now children
Set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

[Chorus 2]
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

[Bridge]
Angels at the back door
Everything is all right
All we need is some direction
Every time the wind blows
Everything you don't know
Turns into a revelation
And it all adds up inside your head
Time is wasting

[Chorus 1]
Set it off, set it off now children
Set it right
Set it off, set it off now children
Alright
Set it off, set it off now children
Set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

[Chorus 2]
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
