When your left foot takes your first step
A single thought takes up your whole time
I want a thing that I can't see matters
Lacking form
Take my whole time

I'm on another thought now
My eyes searching the real face
I'm on another thought now
My eyes searching the real face
Of an angel
I'm on another thought now

It takes my whole time
I'm on another thought now
My eyes searching the real face
Of an angel

I'm on another thought now
My eyes searching the real face
Of an angel

When your left foot takes your first step
A single thought takes up your whole time
I want a thing that I can't see matters
Lacking form
I'm on another thought now
My eyes searching the real face
Of an angel
