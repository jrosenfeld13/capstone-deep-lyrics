Where The Air's Not Clean
Where The Water's Glowing Green
Where The Dogs Are Mean

I'm Moving To Bohemia
Taking You Along
Say Goodbye To Suburbia
You Don't Have To Cut The Lawn

I Had A Dream Of A Different Place
I Had A Dream That You Had A Different Face
I Heard A Scream Of A Desperate Kind
I've Got A Feeling That You're Gonna Love What
You'll Find

Where We're On T.V
Where The Money Grows On Trees
Where The Beer Is Free

Moving To Bohemia
Taking You Along
Say Goodbye To Utopia
We'll Wave Before We're Gone

I Had A Dream of A Different Place
I Had A Dream That You Had A Different Face
I Hear The Beat Of An Anxious Heart
I Feel The Heat...it's Time For Us To Start
Time For Us To Start

I'm Moving To Bohemia
Where The Literature 's Obscene
Bathing In Euphoria
Where The Naked Truth Is On The Screen

I Had A Dream Of A Different Place
I Had A Dream That You Had A Different Face
I Heard A Scream Of A Desperate Kind
I've Got A Feeling That...
You're Gonna Love What You'll Find

You're Gonna Love What You'll Find
