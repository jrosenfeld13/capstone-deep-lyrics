[Verse 1]
Aren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror
I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find

Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side[Pre-Chorus]
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm trying to pull you through

You just gotta be strong[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you

And if I could, I would look at us all the time[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past, I'm here trying to pull you through

You just gotta be strong[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
Stuck in my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me[Break]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you looking back at me
Keep your eyes on me

Baby, keep your eyes on me[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (show me baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me[Hook]You are you are the love of my life (x10)[Verse 3]
Now you're the inspiration for this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home

Just to let you know, you areYou are you are the love of my life (x8)[Verse 4]
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I doYou are you are the love of my life (x16)
