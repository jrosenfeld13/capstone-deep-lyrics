Whisper in my ear and I hear the sea
Wild and fierce sounds so far reaching
It is not what I want floating past me
It is not what I want to sink underneath

I don't know what
I don't know

Your arms are the Earth folding up around me
Comforting gradually, bury me
There is not what I want in a mountain peak
There is not what I want in a valley deep

I don't know what
I don't know

A heart of gold can't glisten in this winter rain
Turn and go, don't wander in this storm again
