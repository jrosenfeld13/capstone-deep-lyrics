Why should I be sorry
Are you worth the crying
Can't be happy, oh I'm trying
Guess I still love you

Why should I be sorry
Didn't you deceive me
Told me that you'd never leave me
Then away you flew
I have the right to forget you
You were unfair from the start
I have the right to forget you
But I haven't the heart

I confess, I need you
Right or wrong, I've missed you
Sorry baby but I've got to kiss you
Please be sorry too

I confess, I need you
Right or wrong, I've missed you
Sorry baby but I've got to kiss you
Please be sorry too
