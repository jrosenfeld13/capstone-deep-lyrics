Send the call out! Gather round!
Light the torches, burn this town!
They've been winning for too long
Little kids, c'mon!

Little nauseous, little sick
Help me get this off my chest
They've been winning for too long
Little kids, c'mon!

Wanna say it now, you ought to know
You wanna say it loud, you gotta go

They fix your fashion, but your will is broken
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You hide your secret, but your slip is showing
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Revolution for the satisfaction
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Get your career, go get fucked
Get your office, go get stuck
You can kick them from the ground
Little kids, c'mon!

Little nauseous, little sick
Help me get this off my chest
They've been winning for too long
Little kids, c'mon!

Wanna say it now, you ought to know
You wanna say it loud, you gotta go

They fix your fashion, but your will is broken
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You hide your secret, but your slip is showing
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Revolution for the satisfaction
Hey! Hey! Hey!
