You've got a chest full of little things
Keeps you remembering over the years

You've got a chest full of little things
Keeps you holding on to the years

And your mouth is open
You're telling me things you wanted to say
Oooh, ooh

If it all washed away
What would you remember
Of everything?

If it all washed away
What would you hold on to
Of everything?

And your mouth is open
You're telling me things you wanted to say
Oooh, ooh

Songs you've never known, oh
All the stories ever told

I've got a chest full of little things
Keeps me remembering over the years

I've got a chest full of little things
Keeps me holding on to over the years

Your mouth is open
You're telling me things you wanted to share
Oh, ohh

All the songs I've ever known
Ohh, ohh
All the stories ever told

Ohh, ohh
All the ones I've ever loved
Ohh, ohh
All the stories ever told

Ohh, Ohh
All the songs I've ever known
Ohh, Ohh
All the ones I've ever loved
Ohh, Ohh
It might just be known
Ohh, Ohh
It is my chest of gold
