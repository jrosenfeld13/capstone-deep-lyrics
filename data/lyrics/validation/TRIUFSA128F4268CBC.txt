As I passed by a fine hotel
I saw a little girl, she sure looked swell
I gave her the eye, I tried to carry on
That big black Cadillac pulled up, huh, she was gone

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Oh, that should have been me
Driving that Cadillac

A little later on, five minutes past
And I saw a lady, she had a lot of class
I was trying to write her name down in my book
Her husband pulled out, give me one of them
Hot real dirty looks

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
The moral of the story is that it
Being her chaperone

Down in the corner was this real sharp cat
Had a 300 dollar platform shoes and a 100 dollar cowboy hat
He was standing on the curb by a fancy Buick down the floor
And this voice from inside says "Come on sugar, let's go"

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
By now you know who that should have been
Driving that Dynaflow

I hate to get heavy but listen to this

I ate some fish 'n' chips, I felt okay
I passed by a fancy cafe
I saw a man eating one of them T-bone stakes
He hollered, gracious stand by the side feeling him, Lordy

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Where was I? I was standing outside with ice cream and cake

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me gettin' my natural kick
That should have been me
Rubbin' on with a chick
