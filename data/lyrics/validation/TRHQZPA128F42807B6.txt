And so the very evil children took the dog out to play in the park
Then they took him home and refused to set him on fire
They were evil evil evil children

And they refused to do as they were told
They would say
"Why should we leave the elderly woman in the expressway?"
"No way, we're not doing it."

Then they would go downstairs
And prepare the Molotov cocktails
Knowing full well that when they were finished
There was no way in hell they were going to blow up the neighbor's barn
They were evil evil evil children

Sometimes in other lives
People expected them to do bad
