(Music: Steve Lee & Freddy Scherer)

I can't stand loosing
And I really hate to complain
But it ain't easy when
You don't know the rules of the game
Words of anger keep falling down on my head
I'm worn out deep inside
Some things just need to be said, to be said

Cuz I do know where I come from
There ain't no shame
And I will prove that I'm not wrong
When all is said and done
When all is said and done

Sometimes I wonder why
I've been always misunderstood
Cuz all those evil tongues
Go round the neighborhood
And no matter what I do
Oh no matter what I say
They remind me all the time
I'm not accepted this way
No way, no way, no way

Cuz I do know where I come from
There ain't no shame
And I will prove that I'm not wrong
When all is said and done
Said and done

Cuz I do know where I come from
There ain't no shame
And I will prove that I'm not wrong
When all is said and done

Cuz I do know where I come from
There ain't no blame
And I'll be back where I belong
When all is said and done
When all is said and done
