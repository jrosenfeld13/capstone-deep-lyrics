I came for you
Just to feel you
Finally
Break in two

I would that you
Spoke with no words
Like paper cuts they hurt

Cicada
Sing like it was afternoon already

Call for your Love
It is bulit soon to end
This heart is

You rendered me
Unprotected
My feet part
Of the floor

I would that you
Spoke with no words
Like paper cuts they hurt

Cicada
Sing like it was afternoon already

Call for your Love
It is built soon to end
This heart is
