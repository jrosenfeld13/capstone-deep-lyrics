[Verse 1]
I never knew myself enough
And let it get the best of me
22 years late but now on time
I won my war and now I'm fine
You're still here but barely whole
You never seem to take control
You're truckin' through the years alone
Just to find me waiting here still by your side

[Chorus]
Light me up like dynamite, don't need a hit when I'm with you
Fall into my bed, don't fight
A little love to get you through

[Verse 2]
Always knew you'd stay the same
But I'll tell it straight, I'm done today
'Cause I missed it once, can't miss it twice
I'm not giving up this chance, this one last dance

[Chorus]
Light me up like dynamite, don't need hit when I'm with you
Fall into my bed, don't fight
A little love to get you through
Light me up like dynamite, don't need a hit when i'm with you
Catch a breath for the last goodbye
We're setting off with something new
(We're setting off to something new)

[Bridge]
Look and you'll find something simple deep inside
But you never take the time, let it breathe, give it time
You don't need the rush to ease the pain
Just take the cards and play your game

[Chorus]
Light me up like dynamite, don't need hit when I'm with you
Fall into my bed, don't fight
A little love to get you through
Light me up like dynamite, don't need a hit when i'm with you
Catch a breath for the last goodbye
We're setting off with something new
(We're setting off to something new)
