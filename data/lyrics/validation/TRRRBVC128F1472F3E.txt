A sudden rush of expectation
As I realise it's you
Like a river in a droughtful season
How cool you didn't call
Initial hint of disappointment
The mirror of my smile
That isn't there, that doesn't follow
A very causal 'hi'
Why did you come at all
If it wasn't for me?
Another blow of resignation
When realise I do
Now in your hands
The book you borrowed
The whole way we first met
Comes together in my head
When the picture's clear you've left
