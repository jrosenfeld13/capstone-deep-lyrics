[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm walking round with a big smile on my face
Hey I'm happy and it shows
Hey I'm back and I'm part of a human race
'Cause you know I've been down so long
Never thought I'd ever feel this way again
And everything was going wrong
'Til you found me and you made me believe again

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
I found you, (oh)
I found you, (oh)
I found you
Damn I'm happy that I found you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you did
But what you did you can keep on doing it yeah
I'm so happy, I wanna fly
'Cause your love just keeps on taking me higher
Don't you know I've been down so long, down so long
Never thought I'd ever feel this way again
And everything was going wrong, going wrong
'Til you found me and you made me believe again

[Chorus]
Ooh, yes I, yes I did
Thank god I
Oh yeah, I found you, (oh)
I found you, (oh)
I found you
Damn I'm happy that I found you
