My mind, speaks a thousand words

It shoots from the hip and it hurts

It keeps me awake like a curse

I toss and turn and hate my mind

My mind, wants to crucify me

Kick back and watch me bleed

I take a pill to get some relief

It's the only way I know to unwind

Oh I can't believe -

It feels like I'm losing my mind

It feels like I'm losing my mind

My mind, my psychiatrist said:

"It doesn't feel at home in your head

You better learn to get some rest

You're only gonna' make yourself worse."

I sing 'cos it keeps things simple

A language of signs and symbols

I analyze each scar and wrinkle

Anything to keep myself blind

Otherwise I find -

It feels like I'm losing my mind

It feels like I'm losing my mind

Come on...

Come on...

My mind, full of fantasy

I drown in my lust and my greed

The world the way I want it to be

I don't believe I'm one of a kind

There must be someone like me -

It feels like I'm losing my mind

It feels like I'm losing my mind...
