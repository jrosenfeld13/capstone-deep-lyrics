Johnny was so brave, and bold
But he never had no self control
Johnny was so brave, and bold
He never listened to what he was told

He used to walk the streets at night
And even in the broad daylight
With no fear to commit a crime
Anywhere anyhow and anytime
But it was too late
This time he could not escape
For so many prices he had to pay
He could have lived to see another day

Johnny was so brave, and bold
But he never had no self control
Johnny was so brave, and bold
He never listened to what he was told

I wasn't surprised when I heard the news
That he was killed by the police
It seemed like he was so confused
Tormented by the (beat?)
So many people gathered round
To see Johnny lying on the ground
In the street where he was shot down

Johnny was so brave, and bold
But he never had no self control
Johnny was so brave, and bold
He never listened to what he was told

After all is said and done
Who might be the next victim to come
As one born another one gone
Take a look at what is going on

(Scatting)

He used to terrorise the streets at night
And even in the broad daylight
With no fear to commit his crime
Anywhere anyhow and anytime
But it was too late
This time he could not escape
For so many prices he had to pay
He could have lived to see another day

Johnny was so brave, and bold
But he never had no self control
Johnny was so brave, and bold
He never listened to what he was told

I wasn't surprised when I heard the news
That he was killed by the police
It seemed like he was so confused
And tormented by the (beat?)
So many people gathered round
To see Johnny lying on the ground
In the street where he was shot down

Johnny was so brave, and bold
But he never had no self control
Johnny was so brave, and bold
He never listened to what he was told
