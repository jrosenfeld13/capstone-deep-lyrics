Confess
Confess, confess
Why don't you confess
Say yes, say yes
I wish you'd reveal to me
Reveal to me
The way that you feel
Why don't you tell me the way that you feel

Confess
Confess, confess
Confess, it isn't a crime
Oh no, no crime
To open your heart to me
Confide in me
And say that you're mine
Why don't ya tell me you're gonna be mine

How long can I keep waiting
For a tender word from you
The sweetest rose starts fading
When the sunshine won't come through
Confess

Confess, confess
Please don't make me guess
Don't make me guess
If you really care for me
If you could care
Then darling confess

Confess
Confess, confess
Why don't you confess
Say yes, say yes
I wish you'd reveal to me
Reveal to me
The way that you feel
You know the way that I feel

Confess
Confess, confess
It isn't a crime
Oh no, no crime
To open your heart to me
Confide in me
Then say that you're mine
Why don't you tell me you're gonna be mine

How long can I keep waiting
For a tender word from you
The sweetest rose starts fading
When the sunshine won't come through

Confess
I'm ready now to confess
Pleas don't make me guess
Uh, us won't make you guess
If you really care for me
I really do
Then darling confess
So now, let's both confess
