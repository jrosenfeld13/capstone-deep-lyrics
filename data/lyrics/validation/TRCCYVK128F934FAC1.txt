High in the sky
Through the clouds and rain
Every familiar field
Seems like an old friend
When every hand that you shake
Is like a warm embrace
Could only be one sweet place
Home and the Heartland

Sing out your songs
And ring out your stories and rhymes
Weave from your dreams
The mystical dances that lead us to
Bind in heart and mind

As we circle the world
With our wandering airs
Gathering here and there
Leaving behind our share
Like the leaves in the wind
They are blown along
Melodies rising from
Home and the Heartland

Sing out your songs
And ring out your stories and rhymes
Weave from your dreams
The mystical dances that lead us to
Bind in heart and mind
