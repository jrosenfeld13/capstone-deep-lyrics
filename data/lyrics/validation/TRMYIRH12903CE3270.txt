Walking the line
You feel your way
Lost and found and lost again
Chasing shadows moonlight miles away
Heart aches like a phantom limb
Every corner hides a ghost
A last good kiss
A freeze-frame memory
An open door inviting one more getaway

He wants to see you
You know he'll always be there when he needs you

You stood the storm
The air is clearing now
Pockets filled with stones
Don't get lost in the undertow

Take a breathe and close your eyes
No more nights lashed to the mast
Come in from the cold
Days of grace are dead ahead
No more border crossing
Stay where you are
The same stars are in your sky
