I am your child
Wherever you go, you take me too
Whatever I know, I learned from you
Whatever I do, you taught me to do
I am your child
And I am your chance

Whatever will come, will come from me
Tomorrow is won, by winning me
Whatever I am, you taught me to be
I am you hope, and I am your chance
I am your child

Whatever I am, you taught me to be
I am your hope, I am your chance
I am your child
