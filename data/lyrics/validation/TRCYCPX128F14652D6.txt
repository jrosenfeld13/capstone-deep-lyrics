You're outta line you're always fucking with my mind
You always waste my fucking time
But now that shit's done
You take your time you always tell me to hurry up
I plainly just don't give a fuck
Youre stuck in the mud

Let's take it back to where it was before
I wanna be a whore
You push me down and I get up off the ground
You really get around you're falling down
Don't you know you're fucking falling down

Falling down

You wanna know just how far that I will go just rip me up
And you will know it's now all that far
