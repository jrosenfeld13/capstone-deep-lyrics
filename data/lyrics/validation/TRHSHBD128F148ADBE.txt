I'll always see your face
The corner of your smile
And all the little things that no one will ever know
Like it was yesterday
Won't ever fade away
Goodbye is just a word that I will never say

You will never be forgotten
A million days could pass us by
But what is time but just a dream
Oh I still feel you here with me
You're more than just a memory
Oh you will never be forgotten

I can't hold your hand
Or look into your eyes
And when I talk to you
It just echoes in my mind
But if hearts are made of dust
And if we fell from the stars
I look up tonight and know just where you are

You will never be forgotten
A million days could pass us by
But what is time but just a dream
Oh I still feel you here with me
You're more than just a memory
Oh you will never be forgotten

And the world just keeps on going
It has no way of knowing
That you're gone

You will never be forgotten
A million days could pass us by
But what is time but just a dream
Oh I still feel you here with me
You're more than just a memory
Oh you will never be forgotten
