She's five foot ten in catsuit and bambi eyes
Everybody's who's staring you wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should have thought I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity
They say you never miss the water until it's gone

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back

I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that

I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that

Wanna speed her real tight get out of this place
If only I could take a stroke
But she's out of my reach forever
So a week ago she lied next to me
So ironic how I had to lose just to see

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back

I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that

I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now?
When you're looking like that
