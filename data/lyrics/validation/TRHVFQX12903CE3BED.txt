Private Eye, it's spy versus spy
Fly away, fly away
It's not so bad, ah but she's just a drag
Not like you, nothing like you

If you want me, come and get me
If you want me, come and get me

Private Eye, I wish I could fly
Fly away, fly away
Oh what a shame
Cause you still act the same
It's not like you, nothing like you

If you want me, come and get me
If you want me, come and get me
If you want me, come and get me
If you want me, come and get me

It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right

Come and get me. Come and get me
Come and get me. Come and get me
Come and get me. Come and get me
