[Verse 1]
Once carried through the current and being swept away
The king is in the closet, he's hiding from today
And though he owns all fortunes, this room is where he'll stay
And his world is filled with darkness, turning grey
Gazing out the window of the 42nd second floor
He is separate from all others, no one knocks upon his door
And it might as well be raining cause the sunlight hurts his eyes
And his ears will never hear the children's cries

[Verse 2]
Once proud and full of passion, he fought the cause of man
Many people loved his courage, many followed his command
He changed the old into the new and the course of things to come
And then one day they noticed he was gone
At first it didn't matter, nobody seemed to care
They all became too busy to find him anywhere
So no one knew, not even him, the problems he would find
On the day he journeyed deep into his mind

[Bridge]
I close my eyes I go far away, away from this battlefield
In my dreams, well, here I will enjoy it
Where innocence plays with all the laughing children
The kind who are crying right now
A taste of freedom from the pain of everything here I see
Life is sweet but I took it all for granted
And now I don't know if I can ever tell you
Just what we permit, we allow

Allow me to forget the life I've made my own
I've held this nation in my hand and yet it's not my home
Allow me just one answer and one reason why
Why this refugee of the family of man must die, tell me why

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Daydreams filled his nighttimes and night dreams filled his days
Confusion and uncertainty, a puzzled mind of haze
You thought he was so powerful and set upon his ways
Well, he left us all to follow through this maze

[Outro]
I heard the king was dying, I heard the king was dead
And with him died the chronicles that no one ever read
The closet's fully empty now, it's occupied by none
I'll draw the drapes, now destiny is done
