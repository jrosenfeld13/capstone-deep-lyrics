There's a quarter of a man in the market
With a quarter of a car so its easy to park it
He gets to the counter he saves what he can
But he only saves a quarter he's a quarter of a man

Now this quarter of a man he got fired
The next damn day he got hired
The only thing wrong with this plan
He only gets a quarter he's a quarter of man

Every day he's on the street
Too few quarters to live or to eat
He's so little the people all stare
But he only pays a quarter fare

Now the quarter of a man's on vacation
But he still gets his ration
When he gets to the market he pays what he can
But he only pays a quarter he's a quarter of a man

Every day he's on the street
Too few quarters to live or to eat
He's so little the people all stare
But he only pays a quarter fare
