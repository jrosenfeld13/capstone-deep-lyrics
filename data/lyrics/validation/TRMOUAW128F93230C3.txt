If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Hang out with the guys and chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it 'cause they stick up for me

If I were a boy I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her 'cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted 'cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you, you thought wrong

But you're just a boy, you don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand how it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her, you don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted 'cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
