Tell me no story, tell me no lies
Tell me the story of little Oma Wise
I'll tell you no story and I'll tell you no lie
How she was deluded by John Lewis's lies

She promised to meet him in the head of Adams' branch
Some money he would bring her and other fine things
She flew like an eagle to the head of Adams' branch
No money did he bring her nor other fine things

No money, no money, my sweetheart said he
Just hop up behind me and married we will be
She hopped up behind him and away tehy did go
Down by the river where the deep water flowed

John Lewis, John Lewis, I'm afraid of your way
I'm afraid that you will lead my poor body astray
He beat her, he banged her, he dragged her round and round
He threw her in the river where he knew she would drown

Two boys was a fishing all on one Sunday morn
The found little Oma's body down by the old mill pond
They threw the net around her, they carried her to the bank
They drew her from the water and laid her on the bank

They sent for John Lewis to come to the place
The put her up before him that he knew her face
My name is John Lewis, my name I do not deny
I murdered my own true lover and her name was Omie Wise

You can beat me you can bang me for I'm the very one
That drowned my own true lover down by the old mill pond
