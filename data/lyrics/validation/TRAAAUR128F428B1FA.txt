I want to smash it up for all the workers
Who spend hours and do nothing
I want to smash it up for all my sisters
Who got caught up in this funky system
I want to smash it up just like a locust
Like a satellite shooting rockets
I want to smash it up in every way I can
Right now I think I want to be your man

Smash it up yeah when I'm down

The gods and masters who made us die so much faster

Everybody right now, come on everyone

And for our right to be, to be treated equal
