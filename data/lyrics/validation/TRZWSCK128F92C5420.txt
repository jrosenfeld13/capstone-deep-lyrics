People can't imagine what goes on up here
They think it's all scrub brush and deer
Some things keep their color all the time

Now I see what you mean
And I see what you meant
When you showed the frame to be bent

And the gutters are full
And my feet stay dry
And my feet stay dry
Ooh, the gutters are full
The gutters are full
And my feet stay dry
And my feet stay
