With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes

In the temple of love, shine like thunder
In the temple of love, cry like rain
In the temple of love, hear my calling
In the temple of love, hear my name

And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away

With the sunlight died and night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside

With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
Shine like thunder, cry like rain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger, cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before us
Black wind calls my name to you no more

[Ofra Haza]
Ooooooooh

In the black sky thunder sweeping underground
And over water sounds of crying weeping
Will not save your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing, ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains

In the temple of love (temple of love), shine like thunder
In the temple of love (temple of love), cry like rain (cry like rain)
In the temple of love (temple of love), hear the calling
And the temple of love
Is falling down

[Ofra Haza]
Ooooooooh
Temple of love
Ooooooooh
Temple of love
Ooooooooh

In the temple of love (temple of love), shine like thunder
In the temple of love (temple of love), cry like rain (cry like rain)
In the temple of love (temple of love), hear the calling

In the black sky thunder sweeping underground
And over water sounds of crying weeping
Will not save your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and air remains
The only haven you can trust

And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away

With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
Shine like thunder, cry like rain
And the temple grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before
This black wind calls my name to you no more

[Ofra Haza]
Ooooooooh
Temple of love
Ooooooooh

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes

In the temple of love (temple of love), shine like thunder
In the temple of love (temple of love), cry like rain (cry like rain)
In the temple of love (temple of love), hear the calling
And the temple of love
Is falling down
