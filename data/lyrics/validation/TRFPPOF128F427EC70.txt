Ba baba badabada

Hey! It's gonna snow tonight
I know, I will be liking it
So let's go, let's go!
Step out of the house
Step into the white
Put on that dress tonight
The one your mom don't like

I'll see you at the lights
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada

Hey! I saw your photograph
Oh no, did it make you laugh?
I said no! Oh no!
Street lights, too bright
Give me some now
Do me something to do
With somebody like you
We could be in the sky

I'll see you at the lights
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada

Hey! I'm deep inside of me
No lights on my Christmas tree
I said no! That's not a bar
Get out, to a bar
Get out like a blonde gets out of a car

How right you are!
You are my guard in blue
You are my boogaloo
You wear my favourite shoes

I see the light in you
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada
I see the light in you
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada (in you)
Ba baba badabada
Badabababababa badabada
Hey!
