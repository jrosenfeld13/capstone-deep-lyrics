Springtime for the world

Just because you swing a different way
Doesn't mean that we're like night and day
There's a place for you and a hope for me
The understanding that can set us free

And every now and then you hear them say
There's no such thing as society
It's an evil thing they try to make you believe
That human nature's ruled by fear and greed

And just because you swing a different way
Doesn't mean that we're like night and day
So, cast your mind across the bare facts, people
The cost of living is depression and a poll tax

Do you wanna build (do you wanna build)
Gonna build springtime for the world (springtime for the world)
Mmmm do you wanna build (do you wanna build)
Gonna build springtime for the world

If the ideas justify the ends
I'd only pledge myself to higher things
To be consumed by life's frustration
The day they'll trust their own imagination

And hope lies in the hearts of the young
Who seek happiness and freedom
Whoever can define a friend or foe
The old traditions and the borders go

And just because you swing a different way
Doesn't mean that we're like night and day
So many gods I don't know where to turn
It seems the more you lose the more you earn

Do?
Do you wanna build (do you wanna build)
Springtime for the world (springtime for the world)
Mmmm hmm do you wanna build (do you wanna build)
Springtime for the world

(Higher)
Gonna take ya
(Higher)
Gonna take ya
(Higher)
(High)
Ummm aahhh (do you wanna build)
Ganna build springtime for the world (springtime for the world)
Hey! High
Do you wanna build (do you wanna build)
Gonna build springtime for the world

Springtime for the world
Springtime for the world
Do you wanna build
Springtime for the world
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
