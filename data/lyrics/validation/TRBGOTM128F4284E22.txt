I'm gonna make the whole world do it
I'm hustlin' and take 'em by the heart
Won't suffer for delight, not even for one night
You know there's no reason for alarm

Never to late, the sun don't love the day
And I'm not here just to play

No, no, no

You try to make the whole world do it
You hustlin' and take 'em by the arm
Don't suffer for the light
You know there's no reason for alarm

Never to late
I'm not here for to play

No, no, no
