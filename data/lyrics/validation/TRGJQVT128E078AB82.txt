I'll break out
I can't breathe here

I'll break out
Rescue me

I can't breathe here
Rescue me

I'll break out
Break out of this cage
I can't breathe here
I need more space
I'll break out
With maximum speed
No matter how
I'll escape the stampede

Rescue me
Rescue me
Rescue me

I'll break out
Break out of this cage
I can't breathe here
I need more space
I'll break out
With maximum speed
No matter how
I'll escape the stampede

Rescue me
Rescue me
Rescue me from agony
Rescue me from agony

I'll break out
I'll break out
