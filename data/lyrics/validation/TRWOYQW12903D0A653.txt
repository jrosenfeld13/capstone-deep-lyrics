[Verse]
Oh, let's shake hands
Oh, baby, let's shake hands
Well, there's something here in the air
Jump up and let me know when you're there
Baby, let's shake hands
Oh, let's be friends
Oh, baby let's be friends
I can't come up with a better plan
Put your fingers in my hand
Baby let's be friends
Yeah
Oh, say my name
Oh, baby say my name
Well, you can do what you want to do
Throw it in the garbage can
But just say my name
Yeah
