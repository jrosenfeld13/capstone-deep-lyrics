[Verse 1]
2 am, I lie down deep in slumber
Feelings of falling downward
I want to forget
Waking up I hear the way your voice sounds
My heart starts to pound now
To the rhythm of yours
You're so angelic
Your words so symphonic
Touch your lips to my soul
Eat this sorrow away
How am I so lucky I
Found you?

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like I'm still dreaming
It seems like everyday you're always on my mind
This is how we stay
So connected, so connected
Over space and time

[Verse 2]
When we talk about all my old drama
You look at me and wonder
How I'm not insane
Every week the days seem to get longer
But you know our love gets stronger
With every word we say
Stronger everyday
You know I would do anything
For you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you were feeling down
You know Id feel it now
We give each other strength to make it through the darkness
You take me to a place
I never want to leave
I'm in my deepest dream, I don't ever want to wake up
I'll fight 'til I die
I won't say goodbye, and I won't let this pass me by

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let's run away, run away, run away now
Let's go away, go away to someplace safe
I want it all, now I want everything
This is how we stay
So connected, so connected
Over space and time
