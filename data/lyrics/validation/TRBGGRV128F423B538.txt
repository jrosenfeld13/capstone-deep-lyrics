Monkey wrench in my hand
In my groin, a swollen gland
Tonight, perform brain surgery
Or some gynaecology

Clockwork Orange fast becoming
Rampant street gangs overrunning
After darkness, waging war
What do they keep living for?
Sex and violence!

SEX!
AND VIOLENCE!

I love to hear you scream in vain
Splattered blood and semen stains
Rape and murder, lesson learned
Meaning of life? Pain and sperm!

Prey upon the old and helpless
Reconditioning is useless
Ultra-violent offsprings of gore
What do they keep living for?
Sex and violence!

SEX!
AND VIOLENCE!

IF YOU CAN'T EAT IT OR FUCK IT
THEN KILL IT!

Sexual deviation
Religious desecration
Civil mutilation
Violent procreation

Bleed for me!
