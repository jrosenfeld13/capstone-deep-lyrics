Sending it all right back waiting for heart attacks
Watching the days collide changing with the weather
Trying to keep it clear slither on broken tears
Searching for ways to cure who will make it better
Cause you will never keep me down you can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds cut the ropes around me
You'll see me shine shine like the sun

Conditioned compatible youth TV and comfort foods
Sending back down the news they're hoping that it's better
Cause you will never keep me down you can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds cut the ropes around me
You'll see me shine shine shine like the sun I'll shine like the sun yeah
I'll shine like the sun I'll shine like the sun shine like the sun

I wanna lift myself up to the sky serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while
Cause you will never keep me down you can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds cut the ropes around me
You'll see me shine you'll see me shine shine like the sun

I wanna lift myself up to the sky serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds cut the ropes around me
You'll see me shine shine shine like the sun
