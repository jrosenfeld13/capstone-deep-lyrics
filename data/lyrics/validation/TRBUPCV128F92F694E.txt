[Verse 1]
I've been watching you, girl, from the back of my car
I see you're unsure of the place that you are
Groceries spilling up out of your bag
Thinking you'll end up a penniless hag
But I see the girl that you are deep inside
Won't you allow me to give you a ride
I can console you and give you a kiss
Show you that you can do better than this

[Chorus]
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand

[Verse 2]
I know that you're thinking I'm trying to score
But deep in your heart you know that I'm more
Than a cad or a scoundrel, now that I've found you
I don't want to lose you, how can I prove to you
That I am sincere, you don't need to fear
I'm not like the others, I'll be like a brother
I will protect you, never disrespect you
But if you need love then I'll be here to sex you

[Chorus]
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man, I'm gonna be there
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand

[Bridge]
It might take a while to get with the style
Of life at the end of the miracle mile
But you're going to love the rising above
All the trash that is sweeping you under the rug
I'm going to be there

[Chorus]
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand
