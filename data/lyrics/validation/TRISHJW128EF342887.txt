There used to be a place
I could call my home
It was just another phase
Now I'm sitting here alone
I was living in a whirl
Now it's history
But I can't go back, my friend
I'm gonna keep on 'til the end
CHORUS
I know everything's gonna be O.K
But I can't go, I can't go home again
I used to know a face
Thought I was in love
But I was in a haze
Now I think I've learned enough
And I can't go back again
I'm the loser in the end
REPEAT CHORUS
Seen the strangest things
Stories I could tell
Angels with their wings
Clipped by those from hell
But I can't go back, my friend
I'm gonna keep on 'til the end
REPEAT CHORUS
And I can't go back again
I'm the loser in the end
REPEAT CHORUS
I can't go, I can't go home again
I can't go home again
