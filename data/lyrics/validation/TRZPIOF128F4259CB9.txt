Look who it isn't, it's, the 'It Man' maybe
The physical description fits, 'It Man' baby
You had a Julia Caeser haircut
Middle market leisure wear
But don't let him be your teddy bear...
Could be 'It Man' ...baby

You want women, wall-to-wall
'It Man' got
Meet the man who started it all
'It Man' got

What's it to to be then John?
A brunetto, or a bleeding blonde?
The tell-tale tongue of a two-ton taste bomb
Is the kiddy coming on?
Like the 'It Man' baby

Take the sugar. Dump the crumbs
It's a mugs game
Take some bugger for a lump sum
And bugger off to Spain

An endless stream of fizzy drinks for 'It Man.'
Who's dentures gleam like sovereign cuff-links
'It Man' baby

Who drove the van?
Some all purpose also ran
When the shit hits the fan
Who's gonna carry the can?
For 'It-man.'

He's after all your stuff
His motto is... 'receive.'
Too much is not enough now
Let's not be naive

Drip-dry, zip-fly, 'It Man.'
Kiss the girls and make them die, 'It Man' baby
Underneath that yellow shirt
Beats a heart of solid dirt
The most disgusting man on earth, 'It Man' baby

No back chat was ever written
For It Man's 'tart.'
The cute cat or the stiff kitten
'It Man' took her apart
He shook away the poison pen
Next thing... 'News-at-Ten.'

Ladies and Gentlemen... 'It Man'

Well well, bloody hell, 'It Man.'
Checking you out and ringing your bell
You better quit man

He's walking around, taking names
Looking for money in the burnt remains
All stories finish in flames for 'It Man.'

'It Man.'

'It Man' baby
