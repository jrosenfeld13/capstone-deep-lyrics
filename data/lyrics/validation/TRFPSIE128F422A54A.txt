I put so much faith into you
I trusted everybody except myself

Tales of your behaviour
Like paper in a book
You try to be my saviour
How come you can not see the truth?

I am-ok, if am-ok, you see...

Don't be such a stranger
I am-ok, but you're in danger
I walked for years to get this far
I have to tell you once again...

You say my dreams have all turned grey
How ignorant of you to say
You claim that you can feel my pain
Insane of you to stay
