It's just a matter of time before she fucks up your mind
She's gonna play with your head, just like she's playing in bed
She's not yours to keep, she don't belong with you
Don't get yourself too deep 'cause she's too good to be true

You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait!

She likes it when you're weak, she likes to be in command
You're not supposed to speak, only at her demand
Don't be surprised if she loves you, or says that she does
She want something of you, you'll never know what it was

You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait up for her
You wouldn't wanna wait!

She's a machine
She's a machine

She'll rip your heart, chew it up, spit it out
She plays her part right
Watch and learn you'll burn
She haunts your dreams, your body and soul
Leaving you wounded empty and cold

She's a machine
