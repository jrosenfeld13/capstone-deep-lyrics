Cross San Fran border on the speedway
Fly into Paris on a new plane
A pirate laughed at me in LA, then I'm smiling at you

Couldn't tell you why, couldn't tell you why

I just been bowling in Nebraska
Not too far from Lincoln border
I met some vessels in Atlanta
Who are aligning with you

Couldn't tell you why. Couldn't tell you why I was so cold with you then

Don't think you're miles and miles away
It's just a thought on a worried day
Don't cry miles and miles away

We still love you at home but you're not here now
