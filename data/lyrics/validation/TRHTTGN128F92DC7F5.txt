When will they remove the tourniquet?
Is the operation over yet?
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down?

I can hear the generators hum
Roaring like an evil stadium
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down?

But this frame is collapsing under all of the weight of my self
And this desperate wish that they'd pin it on somebody else
Somebody else

Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down?

Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down, sir?
Will you calm down?

But this terrible drone is the sound of a thousand machines
Singing just to themselves in a language that no one can read
No one can read
