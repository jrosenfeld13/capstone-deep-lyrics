[Verse 1]
Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly

[Chorus 1]
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

[Verse 2]
Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

[Chorus 2]
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart

[Bridge]
(Fly, fly)
Rise to the heights of all you can be
(Fly, fly)
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

[Chorus 2]
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart
