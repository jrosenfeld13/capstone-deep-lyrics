Wow, yeah

Roger:
One, two, three, four
Oh, you gonna take me home tonight
Oh, down beside that red fire light
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
Ooh

Hey
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me, wow
Yeah

I've been singing with my band
Across the water across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Wear kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them naughty ladies every time
Come on

Oh, won't you take me home tonight
Oh, down beside your red fire light
Oh, you gonna give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round

Ooh, wooh, oh
I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
Oh, but I've still got my pleasure
I still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you better make a big man outta me
Now come on

(Oh, you gonna take me home tonight) please, please, please, wow
(Oh, down beside that red fire light) take me home
(Oh, you gonna let it all hang out) let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
