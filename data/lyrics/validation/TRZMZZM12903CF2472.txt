The unsaid tone of weak despair, fail to resonate
Frayed end of our binding thread will disintegrate
By the laws our physics stage, failure to communicate
None too sentient, hear no, see no worthless magic
Against all function, ongoing choices the trials will end
Filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
Indecision/nonvision, what matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you; empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy

So overcome with pointless tears to test pain receptors
Nothing matters ever here, put up a nonreaction
These eyes will never see, covered up from reality

Look at the shell that is you; empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy

The unknown world that you deny, no priority
Cannot fail if you never start, how predictable
I want to know where for madness to start
Always the sceptic and never be part
Introvertive, indescriptive; it matters not, not

Look at the shell that is you; empty, fragile, and weak

Look at the shell that is you; empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy
The shell that is you; empty, fragile, weak
Oh, the battle is over, lost to apathy
