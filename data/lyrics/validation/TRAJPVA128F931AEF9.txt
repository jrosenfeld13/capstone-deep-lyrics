I'm turning in I think it?s time for me to go
I'd let you in but I just wanna take it slow
Look a little closer it's not hard to know
We got something more and that?s not typical

When I first saw your face I didn't look again
I didn't go there cause I just got myself up again
But you know what to say to take my breath away
And I had no idea that things would change

Chorus
I?m saving up every word
Keepin' em together cause they sound so good
I?m holding onto every word
That?s whats got me feeling alive yeah

Every word you say is like it?s from a poem
Sending me to places I have never known

Something bout our vibe is like a chemical
If we don?t do this right I think it might explode

When I first saw your face
I didn?t look again
I didn?t go there cause I just got myself up again
But you know what to say to take my breath away
And I had no idea that things would change

Chorus
I?m saving up every word
Keepin' em together cause they sound so good
I?m holding onto every word
That?s whats got me feeling alive yeah
