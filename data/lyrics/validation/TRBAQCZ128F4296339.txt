Recoil
Subhuman
Backslider
Backslider, Backslider, headin for hell
Caught in a landslide, pure caine trail
Paleface, no trace, hidin from the man
Starin at the mirror with a gun in your hand
Backslider, Backslider, lost in pain
Cant slay the dragon when hes runnin through your veins
Noddin out, no doubt, hidin from the man
Starin at the mirror with a gun in your hand
Backslider, Backslider, sinkin on down
Like a rooster in a rainstorm, you gon drown
Juice head, bout dead, hiding from the man
