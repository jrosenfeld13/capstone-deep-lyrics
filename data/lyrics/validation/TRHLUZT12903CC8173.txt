If I wake up tomorrow
I'll paint the city in white and bloody red
Maybe then can I remember
What it was like to be with you

And if I sleep for a hundred nights
I'll cover the walls of my room with posters of you
Maybe then can I remember
What it was like to sleep you

I really wanna take you there
Where I know you'll be in my hands
I really wanna take you there

Maybe then can I remember

I really wanna take you there
Where I know you'll be in my hands
I really wanna take you there

What it was like to be with you
