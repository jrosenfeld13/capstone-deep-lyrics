Look into my eyes
What's burning down for you again
What's wrapped in ice
Make it melt
Look in these eyes
Dive in the deepest cells of mind
You crawl in my mind
I live in your dreams
Your tears like rain
It's in my blood, it's giving me pain
Just take me back
Know the way? Be my drug
Some pretty faces
And glowing colors
From crowded places
These violent strings
Are haunting my mind
Are haunting my dreams
Those hands that touched me
And burned my lips
