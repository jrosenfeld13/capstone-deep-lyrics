[Verse 1]
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something that crossed over from another century?

[Verse 2]
Thought Id shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Dont have to look no further, youre the soul of many things
I could say that Id be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

[Verse 4]
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now Im in some better place
My hands on the sabre and youve picked up the baton
Something there is about you that I cant quite put my finger on
