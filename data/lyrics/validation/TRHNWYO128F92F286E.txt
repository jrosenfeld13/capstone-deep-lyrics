Blazing to their pikes
Turning to dust
Gusting with the wind
They (still) dream of an older delusion

Reigning, raining
Dampening the empire
Their excursion burns with the ashes

Calm lakes mirrored
Glistening everywhere
They rove through the waters and fires

Silent seas paused
Enlightening low light
Their visions for imperishability

The weakened flesh
Expecting downfall
Their ashes spread through lightless, starless skies

The Eminence
Not expecting wind
They (now) think of a newer illusion

[Chorus:]
PRAISE - The ancient times
AS EARTH - Equates their end
COMMAND - The ancient times
LIKE TARA - Shall never pretend
DIES - Irae, dies illa
QUIDQUID - Latet adparebit
NIL - Inultum remanebit
DEPOSE - Towards ancient times

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat All Verses In Reversed Order Excluding The First & Last]
