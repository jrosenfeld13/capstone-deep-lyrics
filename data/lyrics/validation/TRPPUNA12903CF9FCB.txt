Will you always keep me warm
Hold me safe and away from harm
Keep day from night and as the day fades
Burn a candle bright for me

Will you always keep me warm

Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun

Will you always keep me warm
Give me shelter from the wildest storm
When I'm glowing
Will you tend evergreen love without end

Will you always keep me warm
Hold me safe and away from harm
Keep day from nightand as the day fades
Burn a candle bright for me

Will you always keep me warm

Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun

Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
Walking into the sun
