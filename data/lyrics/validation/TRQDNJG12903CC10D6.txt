[Verse 1: Cecil Otter]
We're lying in a minefield of dreams
We count those sheep as they scream
They never made it over the fence
With each noble attempt, we just sat there conscious
Been the longest, sleepless few years ever
Defeat feels beautiful together
The breeze feels suitable to weather
So for better or worse is working for the better
And we never, ever gave our letters away
Just gained some pleasure from the pain
We ain't some veterans for fame
We aim with the heart, and we never miss a target
And we're playing in the dark with the archers
The robbers, the honor
The offer to never turn the lights on
Better learn to fight long nights
Wrong moves lose battles
When the sun is down, look around

[Hook: Cecil Otter] x2
So look it down, go look down the barrel
Look what you found, the bang for the buckshot
The ricochets graze, the blood drops


[Bridge: Cecil Otter]
So go ahead and look it down
Go look down the barrel of that fun gun
Look what you found
You got no more face
So when the hot sun's setting on a shotgun wedding
I will not tie the knot where the shots come heading
At my head, I will not be caught dead
Walking off to my bed with a death threat

[Verse 2: Cecil Otter]
We got no time to take orders
It just ain't in the cards when you're self-made
No time for an angel on a shoulder
We got to make room for the barrel of a 12-gauge
Self trained, remaining [?]
I wasn't unsure, I was just waiting for the rupture
It never came, so we're playing with thunder
Now we hunger for slumber, we're out and we're hunting
Some thousand-something hounds that are coming
The growlin' run 'em up, now we'll shut 'em up
Proudly pucker up and throw them all a kiss for kicks
Prevail and jot it down quick
And we'll hollar that shit, we'll bottle that shit up
We'll model that did-up, go bottom up, flip out
So get out your gun, ma, let off a couple rounds
Let all these outlaws know we don't fuck around

[Hook] x2
