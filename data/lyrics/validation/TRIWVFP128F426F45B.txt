The dream is in my sight
And my mind's been captured by this overdose of light...
And the face that brought me change
Has now begun to strangely rearrange
But I've seen better ways, I'm not too easy to amaze
Sunrise Highway, someday we will find...
Sunrise Highway, it's always on my mind...
Can't you see that this could be the future of mankind?
Sunrise Highway, young man don't be blind...

The eye has doubts of peace
And the road ahead shows darkness soon will cease...
We're closer than we've ever been
Traffic rolls on towards the sun...

But I've seen better ways, the need for change inside me always stays...
Someday I'll find my Sunrise Highway

The dream is in my sight
And my mind's been captured by this overdose of light...
And the face that brought me change
Has now begun to strangely rearrange...

But I've seen better ways, the need for change inside me always stays...

Sunrise Highway is where I wanna be...
Sunrise Highway, come on now and see...
You got the time, so get in line, come on board with me
Sunrise Highway, young man go be free...

But I've seen better ways, the need for change inside me always stays...
The dream is in my sight...
