This is waterfall of human tales
Just a piece of good luck
Is all that we claim
But I'm told by a friend
It's imore than sure
Just as clear as the sky
There is no fortune for all
And this is nobody's fault
And this is nobody's share
And I Say:

Somebody's soaked
Somebody's clich
Am I caught in the storm
The sleeping creature
For I beg high and hope
For I beg high and hold
Till I fall in the storm
I did not reach it
I did not reach it

This is whore that prays in church
Torn her soul
This is countess on the ball
But the title is stolen
This is a cripple from the war
The guy you know
But the answer's in the end
Something cannot be changed
And this is nobody's fault
And this is nobody's share
And I Say:

Somebody's soaked
Somebody's clich
Am I caught in the storm
The sleeping creature
For I beg high and hope
For I beg high and hold
Till I fall in the storm
I did not reach it
I did not reach it

Somebody's soaked
Somebody's clich
Am I caught in the storm
The sleeping creature
For I beg high and hope
For I beg high and hold
Till I fall in the storm
The storm of clich

Somebody, everybody
High or low, or hiding
Nobody's born as a creature
You better be
Not mad at me
'cause body falls
Vanishes souls
Me better fear
Nobody's born as a creature
Nobody's creature
And nobody fears

Somebody's soaked
Somebody's clich
Am I caught in the storm
The sleeping creature
For I beg high and hope
For I beg high and hold
Till I fall in the storm
I did not reach it
I did not reach it
