Hey little darlin
I'm comin' your way little darlin
And I'll be there
Just as soon as I'm all straightened out
Yeah just as soon as I'm perfect

Some things are just pictures
They're scenes before your eyes
And don't look now
I'm right behind you
Coolsville
Coolsville

And down by the ocean under the boardwalk
You were so handsome we didn't talk
You're my ideal
I'm gonna find you
I'm goin to Coolsville
So perfect
So ideal
