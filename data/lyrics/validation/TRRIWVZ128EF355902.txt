I was sitting here thinking about some old times
Some old times, some old friends
Suddenly it came across my mind
That I would like to see you again

Remember how we used to walk and talk
Walk and talk holding hands
We said we loved each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans

But the years have come and gone
And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight your memory's awful strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again

It's funny how an old flame comes down
Come on back, make you blue
But I saw the picture of a railroad track
An old shot of me and you

I guess I'd better straighten up my mind
Straighten it up and go to bed
I pray that I don't dream about old times
Some old times, gone and dead

But years have come and gone
