[Verse 1]
Lived your life to the full
With a lifetime of smiles
Made us know right from wrong
Always knowing of lies
You made us be tough
But never too rough
Rise above's what you said
Never easily lead

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day we'll all sing along

[Chorus]
'Cause this is your song
We wrote it for you
It won't take all day
Just a minute or two
You were our friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song

[Chorus]
So we'll try and go on
Loving all that we know
Through the hardest of times
You put on a show
You made us stand tall
When all around us would fall
Even when you were low
You believed you could fly

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day we'll all sing along

[Chorus]
'Cause this is your song
I wrote it for you
It won't take all day
Just a minute or two
You were our friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song

[Bridge]
Ooh yeah
And one day we'll all sing along

[Chorus]
'Cause this is your song
I wrote it for you
It'll take all our lives
Just to help us get through
You were our friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll sing along
This is your song
