[Verse 1]
Without any training
It's pouring, it's raining
Training or a trade
Hey, you bet I'm afraid
Unequipped with a skill
But I'm thrilled with the thrill
Underskilled, unprepared
Hey, who wouldn't be scared

[Hook]
Woh, dime for a dozen if that's what you're after
Woh, a moment of silence, a lifetime of laughter

[Verse 2]
So, bring on the obstacles
And burn me a bridge
I'm not sure, should I call
This my range or a ridge?
There ain't none too high
If I'm up for the climb
I'll go zero to sixty
And stop on a dime

[Hook]
Woh, dime for a dozen if that's what you're after
Woh, a moment of silence, a lifetime of laughter

[Bridge]
On the brighter side
And on a happier note
The noise, well it's just love
That gets caught in my throat
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
[?]

[Verse 3]
The end of the line's
Not the end of a rope
Just a salesman
Selling a bucket of hope
When the bucket gets kicked
And my chips are all cashed
My intentions, conventions
Are finally smashed

[Hook]
Woh, dime for a dozen if that's what you're after
Woh, a moment of silence, a lifetime of laughter
