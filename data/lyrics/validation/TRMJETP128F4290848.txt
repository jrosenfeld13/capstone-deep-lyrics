Keep it a secret
Keep it a secret
Keep it a secret
You know I'm not a single man
But anyway you think you can
Come up to me and make a try
By saying make this a night to remember
What you said to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you did to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you wanted me to do
(Keep it a secret)
What you said last night
(Keep it a secret)
When you came up tight
(Keep it a secret)
What was I supposed to do
(Keep it a secret)
I don't know what made you believe
My simple heart could be so weak
That I could fall for your offense
In saying make this a night to remember
What you said to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you did to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you wanted me to do
(Keep it a secret)
What you said last night
(Keep it a secret)
When you came up tight
(Keep it a secret)
What was I supposed to do
(Keep it a secret)
Don't worry, don't worry
You know my lips are sealed
Don't worry, don't worry
You know my lips are sealed
What you said to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you did to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you wanted me to do
(Keep it a secret)
What you said last night
(Keep it a secret)
When you came up tight
(Keep it a secret)
What was I supposed to do
(Keep it a secret)
What you said to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you did to me
(Keep it a secret)
What you wanted me to do
(Keep it a secret)
What you said last night
(Keep it a secret)
When you came up tight
(Keep it a secret)
What was I supposed to do
(Keep it a secret)
Keep it a secret
Keep it a secret
Keep it a secret
