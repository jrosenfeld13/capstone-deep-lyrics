Rusty wire
Bent to make a fence
Rows and rows of houses
Cold hands still, until tomorrow
Wrestling waters
Colored by their stones
Some ungrateful morning
Kick the sand
Stir up the powder

Strip it down
To what, you can believe in
Pass it on
What is right and True Blue, True Blue

Todays the day
My branches bear their fruit
And all my labor will be rewarded
Then I awake
Its like starting over

Strip it down
To what you can rescue
Pass it on
What is right and True Blue, True Blue

Shifting stages and shapes
Giving up ground now
Taking anothers place
Holding one's own
What is right and True Blue, True Blue
True Blue, True Blue
