Oh yeah
Cryin' won't help you
When your baby's gone, no it won't
This is what to do

Forget about what could
Yeah, what could have been
That's what you do, now
Just pick up the pieces and start over again

Broken hearts many times
Yes, will make it, just keep on tryin'

Cryin' won't help you now
When you're baby's gone, no it won't
This is what to do
When you're starved and you're lonely, oh yeah

Forget about what could
Yeah, what could have been
That's what you do, now
Just pick up the pieces and start over again, yeah, yeah

Pick up, pick up all those pieces
That's what you do
Pick up those pieces
Start all over again, oh yeah
Pick up the pieces, now, I know you can
