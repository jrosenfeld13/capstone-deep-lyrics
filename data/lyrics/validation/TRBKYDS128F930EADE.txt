I'm in a shattered state
And my heart keeps breaking
I'm an island sinking
Slow and frail inside

I've tried to make this work
A thousand times
So don't walk away from me
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah
From me, no

And if I fall from this
Will I get back up again?
Will you carry me
When I'm broken up inside?

You wanted everything
Well I'm sorry now
If you walk away from me
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah
From me, no

And so you try
To walk away
Don't walk away
From me
And if you leave me here
And look away
Don't walk away
From me
Oh

From me
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah
From me
No (x3)
