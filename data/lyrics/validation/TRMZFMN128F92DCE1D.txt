Any day now
I will hear you say: "Goodbye my love!"
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Oooh
Any day now
I'll be all alone
Ouh, ouh, ouh!

Any day now
When your restless eyes meet someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Oooh
Any day now
Love will let me down
Ouh, ouh, ouh!

Oh, my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Oooh
Any day now
I'll be all alone!

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay!

Any day now
When the clock strikes "Go", you'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Oooh
Any day now
Love will let me down 'caus you won't be around!

Don't fly away my beautiful bird
Don't fly away my beautiful . .
