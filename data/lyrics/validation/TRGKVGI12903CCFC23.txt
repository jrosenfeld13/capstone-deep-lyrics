Don't let me forget
Where I started
Cuz I keep losing my sight
I'm blinded by the light

My dreams are in front of me
And everything I've worked for is standing in my door

I know I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe
I know that I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe

We choke when we focus on negativity
When did this turn into something we took for granted
This road won't take us home
This road won't take us home (won't take us home)
Won't take us home
This road won't take us home
To the place we thought we know
This road won't take us home
To the place we thought we know

I know I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe
I know that I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe

Take a breathe
Take your time
Take a breath
Take your time

My dreams are in front of me
And everything I've worked for is standing in my door
Keep me alive
The faces leading north
Could be the faces that keep us alive
The faces leading north
Could be the faces that keep us alive

I know I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe
I know that I may be the first to forget
But I appreciate the air I breathe
