[Verse 1]
Know no fear, I'll still be here tomorrow
Bend my ear, I'm not gonna go away

[Chorus]
You are love, so why do you shed a tear?
Know no fear, you will see heaven from here

[Verse 2]
I'll shelter you make it alright to cry
And you'll help too 'cause the faith in myself has run dry

[Chorus]
We are love and I just wanna hold you near
Know no fear, we will see heaven from here

[Bridge]
I see real love in your eyes
And it fills me up when you start to cry

[Chorus]
I just wanna hold you near
We will see heaven from here
Well it all seems out of reach
I will take that blame if it keeps the peace

[Verse 3]
My shelf life's short
Wish they'd make it more easy to follow
And I've been caught with nothing but
Love on my mind

[Chorus]
We are love, don't let it fall on deaf ears
Now it's clear, we have seen heaven from here
