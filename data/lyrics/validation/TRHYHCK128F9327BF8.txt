It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like
Something's happening to me

In the summertime I met a guy
He was so fine, He blew my mind
My friends are telling me
Girl he's a loser
But they can't see

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like
Something's happening to me

From the first time I saw his eyes
There was sunshine
Everytime he walks into the room
I feel my heart go boom boom boom

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like
Something's happening to me

There was a time, when I was young
And love it felt so strong
Now it comes back to me
What's going on

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like
Something's happening to me
