When I saw her on the corner
Then I knew I was a goner
I had it, well I've had it

When I talked to her [?]
Then you show up two hours late
I had it, well I've had it

La la la la

When you said that you loved me honey
But you really want my money
I had it, yeah I've had it

Then you tell me that I should call
When I do there's nobody home
I had it, well I've had it

La la la la
