Walk away, nothing to do
I forgot what doing time can do
I'm on the chain gang
The chain gang of love
Wasting my time
I'm just a prisoner of love

I'm a jailbird, baby
Wasting my time
At first feeling blue
And then feeling fine

I'm serving time
For something I can't do
They call it a crime
'Cause I'm not in love with you
'Cause I'm not in love with you

I'm a jailbird, baby
I'm a jailbird, baby
Yeah, I'm a jailbird, baby
'Cause I'm not in love with you
'Cause I'm not in love with you
'Cause I'm not in love with you
'Cause I'm not in love with you
