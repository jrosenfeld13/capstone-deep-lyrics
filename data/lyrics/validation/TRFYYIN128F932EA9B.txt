I was walkin' down the street
And it was gettin' mighty late
Well, the truth of the matter is
This poor girl had been abandoned by her date
When, from out of nowhere came this music loud and clear
Let me see, from over there?
(No, over there.)
Over there?
(Yeah.)

Well, I open up the door
And much to my surprise
The girls were wearin' formals
And the boys were wearin' ties
And I feel that I should mention
That the band was at attention
They just stood there, oh, so neat
While they played their swingin' beat
So I grabbed this little boy
Who came struttin' 'cross the room
And I say, "What's that?"
And he say
"Sophisticated boom, boom"

[Chorus]
It's been long overdue
Sophisticated boom, boom
We been needin' somethin' new
Sophisticated boom, boom

Now stand up straight and tall
Like your back's against the wall
Take two steps forward (One-two, forward)
(Boom-boom, boom-boom) Now shake your hips
Boom, boom

It's been long overdue
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-eh, yeah)

That's not very sophisticated (sophisticated boom, boom)

We been needin' somethin' new
(Yeah, yeah, yeah-eh)

I do think she's blowin' her cool (sophisticated boom, boom)

Now stand up straight and tall
Like your back's against the wall
Take two steps forward (One-two, forward)
(Boom-boom, boom-boom) Now shake your hips

Boom, boom
(Ooo-ooo, oo-oo.)
(Ooo-oo-oooo.)
(Ooo-oo...)
