When I look in your eyes
I could see the scars
But it's not in me
It's all in yourself

Raise your fists
Just keep your voice down in your chest
Cover your heart
Raise your fists
Just keep your voice down in your chest
Cover your heart
Your emptiness
You are gone
Lets Go!

Your emptiness
And your love for yourself
Has made you weak
With everyday and every breathe
You are always holding back

Trying to hold on
To the things that you won't fight to keep
Your life
Trying to hold on
To the things that you won't fight to keep
Your life
Go!

Take my hand and slap my face
And I can't believe this is what I see
Take my hand and slap my face
And I can't believe that this is what I see

You disgrace yourself and all that you love
Go!

And I say it again...
Then don't burden me
Then don't burden me
So don't burden me
So don't burden me

Come on!
Don't burden me
With the lack of trust in yourself
With your loss for words
Design your fate
Don't burden me
With the lack of trust in yourself
With your loss for words
