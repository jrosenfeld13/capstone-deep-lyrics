This is not the beginning of life
This is not the truth
But I wonder if I'll know all your pain again
Cause there is nothing more inside your heart
If nothing chases you

Floating eyes are in your feelings empty poisons in the secret

Feels like it's all forbidden the light goes of I feel so cold
I've never been in your dreams before
Feelings can be your's forever and I am your killer toy
I've never ran in your mind before

I saw you coming here tonight
But it wasn't true and I want to leave
Oh no I lived in a cage
Cause there is nothing more inside your heart
If nothing chases you

Feels like it's all forbidden and the light goes of I feel so cold
I've never been in your dreams before
Feelings can be your's forever and I am your killer toy
I've never ran in your mind before

Fancy noises in the these feelings empty poisons in the secret (x2)

Some other way of ecstacy
She needs a little time a new desire
Cause everybody needs something to kill
And everybody needs a new disguise

Feelings can be your's forever and I am your killer toy
I've never ran in your mind before
Feels like it's all forbidden and the light goes of I feel so cold
I've never been in your dreams before

Feelings can be your's forever and I am your killer toy
I've never ran in your mind before
