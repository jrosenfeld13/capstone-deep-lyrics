Shine on, let the light of love grow stronger
(You've got to)
Shine on let the sun in my heart, a flame in the dark
So let the light of love shine on

Yeeeaahh, let the light shiiine
Yeeaaah

I've been breathing such a long time
In the shadow of someone just like you
Hoping, looking for some sign
But in the minute I saw your face I knew
You are the answers to my mess
I opened my eyes and you were there

Shine on, let the light of love grow stronger
Shine on like the sun in my heart, a flame in the dark
So let the light of love shine on
Let it shine on

There is a reason, that we are together
Every step was leaving me to you
Now I know that, it was worthing
All the parties has brought me closer to
The moment I found my destiny
Open your arms then reach for me

Shine on, let the light of love grow stronger
Shine on like the sun in my heart, a flame in the dark
So let the light of love shine on

This is the first time
Love makes me feel this way
Right here deep in my soul
Baby I know you are the one

You are the answers to my breas
I opened my eyes and you are there
