Hold everything
You've got to if you need to flow
I couldn't think, I'm hoping on a nebula
Hold everything
I couldn't if you need to flow
I, I, I needed him
But Lord, you know it's sin to sin
Hold everything
When will you notice that it's?
When will you go?
When will you see that we are on our own
Let go of everything
You know it's only wrong
Let go of everything
You know it's only, ahh
Shower me with kisses, blue
Don't do those things
Ooh, that the other people do
Let it lie, I feel fine
Empower me all the time
You know that I feel fine
You know you wanna use it
You know that I feel fine
And I know you won't abuse it
Hope every day's gonna feel like this
Hope everyday I'm gonna use it
Hope every day's gonna feel like this
And everyday I'm gonna use it
Hope every drops gonna feel like this
Hoping everyday I'm gonna use it
Hope every drops gonna feel like this
And everyday I'm gonna use it
