It merely took a year for your pledge to disappear. Farewell friend, our ties no longer mend. This tale has come to an end. It wasn't meant to last. You came and left so fast. Your promises are part of the past. You said we'd speak again, but that moment never came. Silence is a close cousin of shame. A man of glass carries the flame. Burn. May the desert bring you comfort. Burn. Enjoy your precious game of cowboys and indians. I hope it's what you envisioned. Black eyes and secret trips slowly revealed your true nature. I should have known better. A new dawn has come. The good times we had turned to bitter souvenirs. The rest of us will persevere. It wasn't meant to last. You came and left so fast. Your promises are part of the past. Carry on. We've grown stronger with your sudden departure. More determined than ever, we'll carry on. We've grown stronger with your sudden departure. Dedicated, we carry on
