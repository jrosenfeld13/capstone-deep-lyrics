A few quiet drinks with the music and the laughter
It's festive and warm on a cold winter's night
Last orders at midnight, we'll stay 'til just after
And then make our way home, when we've been for a bite
I turned-off my phone as we sat in the corner
And it soon slips my mind as the evening progresses
My girlfriend's at home, but I chose not to warn her
I'm sure she won't mind all these girls in these dresses
A few quiet drinks, nothing more, nothing less
A few quiet drinks, oh with my friends...
The drink seems to work, and I'm starting to dance
There's a fine-looking blonde with a fine-looking smile
My mates go berserk when I turn-down the chance
She knows I'm quite fond, and she's known for a while
Now it's not very big, and it's not very clever
As the alcohol sinks to my stomach with a powerful force
The lads go outside, leaving us two together
There's no need to think; nature soon takes its course
A few quiet drinks, nothing more, nothing less
A few quiet drinks, oh with my friends...
And I wake-up in the morning and cradle my head
Oh there's feelings of sickness, feelings of dread
I wait for the phone call to settle my fate
Oh, I'll beg for forgiveness; too little, too late
'Cause you're the most valuable thing, that I've got
Just a few quiet drinks, nothing more, nothing less
But it cost, it cost me everything
A few quiet drinks with the music and the laughter
It's festive and warm on a cold winter's night
