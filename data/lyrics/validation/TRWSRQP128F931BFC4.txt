Something about you baby
That makes me wanna hug ya (hug ya) love ya (love ya)
Something about you baby
That makes me wanna know ya (know ya) show ya
That I only wanna be with you
Something about you baby
Something about you baby
We just got off the phone
I went and wrote this song
'cause girl you I nspire me
You left this kind of love
That's really let's me know
You're not the average lady

So baby I wanna tell you that I love you so
And that I 'm different than the average joe
'cause girl you touch me I n that special way
That's why I wanna tell ya that I 'm here to stay

Something about you baby
That makes me wanna hug ya (hug ya) love ya (love ya)
Only wanna be
Something about you baby
That makes me wanna get to know ya (know ya) show ya
That I only wanna be with you
Something about you baby
Something about you baby

Oh, baby can't you see
I want you here with me
Forever and a day (a day)
'cause girl you're so fine
You got me mezmorized
Just by the way you carry yourself
So can I spend some time alone with you
And show you all the thing I wanna do
Like take you out and have a real good time
'cause girl I can't get you off of my mind

Something about you baby
That makes me wanna hug ya (hug ya) love ya (love ya)
Only wanna be
Something about you baby
That makes me wanna get to know ya (know ya) show ya
That I only wanna be with you
Something about you baby
Something about you baby
Something about you baby

So can I spend some time alone with you
And tell you all the things I wanna do
Like take you out and have a real good time
'cause girl I can't get you off of my mind

Something about you baby
That makes me wanna hug ya (hug ya) love ya (love ya)
Only wanna be
Something about you baby
That makes me wanna get to know ya (know ya) show ya
That I only wanna be with you
Something about you baby
Something about you baby
Something about you
Only wanna be with you...
