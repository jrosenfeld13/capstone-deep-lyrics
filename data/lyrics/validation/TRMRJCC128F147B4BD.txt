If I only had a car
Wouldn't be here in this bar
Trying to get to you

Time takes toll
The hours I'd roll
Is it a blessing or is it a curse?
Seems this love makes matters worse

I'm stuck in this cafe
Lost along the way
Moving to keep strong
When I'm feeling myself burn
It don't matter let it hurt
It tells me I'm alive

When you saw me in California
I was lost in a dusty haze
Now that I know you
You feel so far away

If I only had a car
Wouldn't be here in this bar
Trying to get to you

As I'm waving you goodbye
Following the line
Trying to get to you

Still the echos fill the void
Your eyes rolled in your head
As you slowly disappeared

Still hard to rearrange
The distance made it strange
I'm still trying to get to you

If I only had a car
Wouldn't be here in this bar
Trying to get to you
