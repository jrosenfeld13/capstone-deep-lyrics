Beyond the human race
It came from outer space
And just to come upon your face
He's got to shake it loose
That sonic reproducer
Just like Medusa only hot
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
With laser lights intact
He's got the fattest sack
And that galactic mack is back
He's got to shake it loose
That sonic reproducer
2001 degrees red hot
Johnny on the spot (wooh)
"Go, Johnny, go!"
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
Johnny on the spot, on the spot
Johnny on the spot (oh,oh,oh)
Johnny on the spot!
