As the moon creeps forth to pierce the clouds
And it's lights embraced by a single howl
This graveyard dream was brought to life
With the breath of jealous winds
Shackled, bound, torched by the light
A thousand angels torn from flight
Longing for heaven's dark cursed
With I to guide the Cain-drawn hearse

This hate within its eyes, for a faith that often lies
From tears of mourning cries be torn
The beast is born wholly of night

Anticipation of the madness to come
Lowly angel flesh undone
Longing for heaven's dark curse
With I to guide the Cain-drawn hearse

A wielder of sickness marching on
A flame in the name of the blackest dawn
Hear my call, your fate my curse shall befall

And a scream was thrown into the night
A bloody shade to stain pure white
Of the dark dreams and lifeless eyes
Shall be un-divine
And a scream was thrown into the night
A bloody shade to stain pure white
And the one crawls nearer to their cries
To feast the beast born wholly of night

Shackled, bound, torched by the light
A thousand angels torn from flight
Longing for heaven's dark cursed
With I to guide the Cain-drawn hearse

This hate within its eyes, for a faith that often lies
From tears of mourning cries be torn
The beast is born wholly of night

A wielder of sickness marching on
A flame in the name of the blackest dawn
Hear my call, your fate my curse shall befall
