Here we go, oh yeah
Its all about You, yeah, yeah
So many days in so many ways
I took for granted, all You had planted
In my life for me to enjoy
Since I was a little bitty boy
Now my eyes are open so I can see
All Youve done for me
Youve made my life complete
Oh, what joy to me You bring
So forever I lift my voice and sing
Its all about You
Im so glad that I have found
The One who turned my life around
Made my world a better place to live
Its all about You
Im so glad You came this way
Made my darkness turn to day
Now its for You I believe
Whenever I think how good Youve been
In spite of my sins, for all the wrong Ive done
I can't help but cry and ask, "Lord, why?"
Show me love unconditionally, in spite of
Now Im taking this stand
Holding up my right hand
And for all of my days
Ill give Your name the praise
Oh, what joy to me You bring
And forever Ill lift my voice and sing
Its all about You
Im so glad that I have found
The One who turned my life around
Made my world a better place to live
Its all about You
Im so glad You came this way
Made my darkness turn to day
Now its for You I believe

Im so glad that I have found
The One who turned my life around
Made my world a better place to live

Made my darkness turn to day

And my being for You
All I do is for You
