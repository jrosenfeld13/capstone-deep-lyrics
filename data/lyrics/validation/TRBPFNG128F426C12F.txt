In my youth I was a loner
And the gaudy red persona
Was still hanging on the wall
A-waiting to enthrall

Had no cannabis to sedate us
So we smoked carrots and potatoes
Tea and head-ache pills
But I can't recall the thrills

So don't talk to me like that
I'm also a cat
Don't know where you've been
But I know where it's at
It's taken me time to work out what to do
What to do with you
Took me all afternoon to think it all through
But now I'm done, done, done, done thinkin'
Done, done, done and I'm thinking:
Oh, Oh No!

Hey Kwanongoma!
You spin me around
My head upside down
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
How low can you go?
When we're out on our own
How low can you go?
How low can we go?

Then you came along
My whole world was changed
With fire and song
My old dreams were gone
And I knew that nothing could tear us apart
And nothing did tear
Tear us apart
Now it hurts in my heart
(I'm singing) Now na-na-na-nothing
Is all I got

Hey Kwanongoma!
You spin me around
My head upside down
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
How low can we go
When we're out on our own
How low can you go
How low can we go?
