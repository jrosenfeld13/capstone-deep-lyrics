We are lying
In a terrible waste of a night
As you're sliding with your mouth all over me

I breathe in
Slowly like your moves
Heartache
Losing my mind
You came to me
I'm trying to escape
With my hands in your hair

We are driving
To a wonderful waste of a night
You got me here
I don't know what to say

I look at you
Climb up on me with your arms
And your heat

Stop it
You move me too fast
Yes we are moving too fast
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

Stop it
You move me too fast
Yes we are moving too fast
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

Stop it
You move me too fast
Yes we are moving too fast
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

We are carrying some bad memories with us
Don't you bore me
This is not the time

So please shut up
I don't wanna know
About you
Or your past

Stop me
You move me too fast
Yes we are moving too fast
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

Stop me
You move me too fast
Yes we are moving too fast
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me  do it away
I am running away cos the fanman haunts me tonight

Are you the fanman?
Are you the fanman?
Are you the fanman?
Are you the fanman?
Tonight

I want you, I want you, I want you more
I want you, I want you, I want you more
