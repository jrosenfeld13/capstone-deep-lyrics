Under the trees
On the ground
There is space
Beneath the leaves
And bottles or needles
The moonlit drinking
Old and wet
From picnics and eating
And books in the office
With photos of medals
Sometimes when i stretch
I stretch hoping to divide
Sometimes when i stretch
I stretch hoping to divide
Under the trees (under the trees)
On the ground (on the ground)
There is space
Beneath the leaves
And books in the office
With photos of medals
Butterflies and canopies
And say it's dull
Sometimes when i stretch
I stretch hoping to divide
Sometimes when i stretch
I stretch hoping to divide
