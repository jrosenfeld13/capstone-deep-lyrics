I saw it walking lonely down the street
Cool like a cat and like a crazy dream
I looked twice again, I can't believe
Oh no, no, no

It turned around and then it looked at me
I thought "oh, no", it really couldn't be
It was a man, it was a woman, too
Wooah

He's a woman, she's a man
He's a woman, she's a

I think it really came from far away
I'm feeling hypnotised, I have to stay
It takes my hand and says "come on let's go"
Let's go, let's go, let's go

We're going home, there's nothing more to say
He starts to move, she starts to play
I need a body, why not you?
Wooah

He's a woman, she's a man, oooh
He's a woman, she's a woman

He's a woman, she's a man
He's a woman, she's a
Woman
