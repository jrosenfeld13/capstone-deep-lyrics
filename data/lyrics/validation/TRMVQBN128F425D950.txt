Trading in gold
Trading in my old man's gold
Laughing at the serious side
And playing with fire

Arrogance pays
Dancing wild and crazed
Fortunate to be that way
No slave to reason

I do believe
You've a right to know
The urgency
Doesn't always show
I see your smiling, smiling faces
Not in every town
Some are up so far
They will never come down

Make no mistake
Everybody wants and takes
Stupid if you go against
Natural science

I do believe
You've a right to know
The urgency
Doesn't always show
I see your smiling, smiling faces
Not in every town
Some are up so far
They will never come down

Open the door
Let yourself in
C'mon open the door
And let yourself in
