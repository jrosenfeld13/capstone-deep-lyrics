Though your presence is nonexistent
Your vile stench still looms in my every memory
You have planted a seed
That has sprouted
Into an undying enmity
That shall rear it's putrid face
And micturate upon the apologies that you have delivered far too late
And the heavens collapsed to hell
Creating a mestophilean being
That possessed you with a sense of depraved indifference
I wish I could have absolved you of the succubus
The one with fiery skin
And the unbecoming nature in which it elenched your mind
Was it i who thrust the blade through your back
Rethink this question
For it was you who let your perceptions distort
The most perplexing of those cirulent amends
Now I'd like to rip your still beating heart from it's blackened cavity
I hope her mournful tears singe your gaping flesh wound
And your black heart will be pounded to dust
And whisked away in the wind
However I will always hold a place in mine for you
And all the destestaion your name brings
You set your bridges ablaze
And left them burning
