Ooh, baby, make it last forever
I wanna reach ecstasy
Don't wake me up if I'm dreaming
'Cos I want more than just a memory, oh...

I wanna make you happy, satisfied
I wanna make sweet, sweet love
Every day and every night

I got a certain feeling
It's a strange emotion
Something that I can't explain
This certain feeling
Has become a deep devotion
I will see you to the end
Babe, you got a friend

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I wanna be inside your body
Always be on your mind
I'm gonna fill you up with love, babe
All you gotta do is give me a sign, whoa...

I wanna make you happy, satisfied
Wanna make sweet, sweet love
Every day and every night

I got a certain feeling
It's a strange emotion
Something that I can't explain
This certain feeling
Has become a deep devotion
I will see you to the end
Babe, you got a friend

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I wanna make you happy, satisfied
Wanna make sweet, sweet love
Every day and every night

I got a certain feeling
It's a strange emotion
Something that I can't explain
(Something that I can't explain)
This certain feeling
Has become a deep devotion
I will see you to the end
Babe, you got a friend
(Oh-oh...)

I got a certain feeling
It's a strange emotion
Something that I can't explain
(Oh, it's something I can't explain)
This certain feeling
Has become a deep devotion
I will see you to the end
Ooh, babe, you got a friend

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
