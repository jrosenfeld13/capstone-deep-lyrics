Bella luna, bella stars and sky
Oh the fire-it's not hot
I cannot say that I am surprised-just sad the water's running out
And it's so sad
My heart is a brick and I can't pick it up
And I'm so mad that I cannot save myself
It makes me cry

Bella luna, Bella baby girl
Sweetest world-put the pearl down
I cannot think of letting go-feel like sinking below these brown eyes
And it's so sad
My heart is a brick and I can't pick it up
And I'm so mad that I cannot save myself
It makes me cry
