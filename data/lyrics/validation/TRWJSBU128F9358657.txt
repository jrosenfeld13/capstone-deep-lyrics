Listen if ya'll don't mind. I just gotta say this
When you've lost everything and you don't know which way to turn, some people need
Fame and fortune, but lemme tell u what i need

Refrain:
(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When i'm down to my last dime (I need You)
When my back's against the wall ( I need You)
Lord i need you( I need You)

Verse 1:
Sitting in front my tv
I was watching CNN
Wit tears in my eyes
Lord knows i cried
See i began to wonder
What in the world is going on
One thing after another
I'm barely holdin' on!!!

Refrain:
(I need You) When everything is going wrong (I need You)
When im down to my last dime ( I need You)
When my back's against the wall ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)
When my friends done told a lie( I need You)
And i'm about to loose my mind ( I need You)
Ya'll dont under stand ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)

Verse 2:
When i'm on top of the world (everything going just fine)
I've found my life can change (with just a blink of an eye) (heyyy)
From the mountain to the valley low such a long, long fall
So in the good times AND in the bad times u better know who to call !

Refrain:
(I need You) when everything is going wrong (I need You)
When im down to my last dime ( I need You)
When my back's against the wall ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)
When my friends done told a lie( I need You)
And i'm about to loose my mind ( I need You)
Ya'll dont under stand ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)

Verse 3:
If i'm in a fight or my darkest night
In the middle of mass confusion
In the worst state i've been
No matter what i'm in
Lord it's your name im callin!

Refrain:
(I need You) when everything is going wrong (I need You)
When im down to my last dime ( I need You)
When my back's against the wall ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)
When my friends done told a lie( I need You)
And i'm about to loose my mind ( I need You)
Ya'll dont under stand ( I need You)
Lord I need you ( I need You)
