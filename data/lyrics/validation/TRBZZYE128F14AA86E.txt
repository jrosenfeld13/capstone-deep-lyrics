A kiss is all I miss
Give me just one
One little kiss give me one more kiss
Is all I miss
One little kiss I live for this
Give me one more kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss

I, I wonder why
I'm flying high
Its because you by my site
This feels so right
A beautifull night
And we see the perfekt sky
Hey pretty baby
I can't take my eyes of you
And hey there is only
One more little thing to do

A kiss is all I miss
Give me just one
One little kiss
Give me one more kiss
Is all I miss
One little kiss I live for this
Give me one more kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss

I hope every day
That you could stay
You were not so far away
This is a dream
But I live for a day
You come back to me
And say there is only
One more little thing to do

A kiss is all I miss
Give me just one
One little kiss
Give me one more kiss
Is all I miss
One little kiss I live for this
Give me one more kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss (lalala...)
One little kiss
(Hey pretty baby I can't take my eyes of you)
One little kiss, one little kiss

A kiss is all I miss
Give me just one
One little kiss
Give me one more kiss
Is all I miss
One little kiss I live for this
