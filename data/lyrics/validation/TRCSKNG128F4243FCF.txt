I get up at nine, I go to work
I come home at five, I feel so alive
I'm free, I'm free
Nights are for T.V., I'm too tired for sex
I watch my program, it's me, it's me
I'm free, I'm free
All I want is freedom
All I want is freedom, freedom
I need my job, but it's done by machine
I smash my TV, it's productiviTV
ProductiviTV
I gotta work, I gotta work
I gotta right to work, I'm not a jerk
Tell me what to do
All I want is freedom
All I want is freedom, freedom
I'm looking at the sky, God help me, help me
I follow Jesus, he sets me free, I'm free
Free in the Lord
All I want is freedom
All I want is freedom, freedom
Freedom from hurt
Freedom from pain
Freedom from desire
Freedom from freedom
Freedom
