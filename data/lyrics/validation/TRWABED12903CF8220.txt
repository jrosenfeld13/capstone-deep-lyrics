We'll strike this city down
This place is painted with murder
Sway, sway my darling, sway
Let's dance dance tonight

It,s been so long
Since I've seen the sun rise up over me
I hear the sirens all around
This is an emergency

This city's filled with ghosts
And these streets won't lead you home
So keep dancing sweetheart
Know my love won't lead you home
The sky is calling out my name
But I don't know if these wings will hold

Our weary eyes failed
From towers as we watched
And the world crumbles
In Your bleeding hands
This could be the death of me
This place is painted with our murder

Swing down sweet chariot, oh
Oh Lord, take me home

We'll fill the air with songs of praise
And make it back here someday
I'll scream your name out as we leave

Please save this ship
Lord save this ship from sinking
