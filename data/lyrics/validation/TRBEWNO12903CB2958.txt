I am a robot man
A robot man
I'm a robot man
I am the robot man

Not going back now
Another falling on the rocks
And I'm not gonna wake up in the morning
With my head in the clouds
Feeling like a nobody
I'm down all the time
I'm never no high
Been a long, long way to fly
But having known my name
Be no pain
Nothing on fried (?) on a Saturday
Walk on the street
Put my feet on the ground
Shuffle shiny shoe
The sun in the eyes
Of the people in the room
That wanna find morning
No life for me
Yeah
Yeah
Are you coming on up?
Are you coming on up, now?

I am a robot man
I'm a robot man

I am a robot man
I'm a robot man

I'm a robot man
I am a robot man
