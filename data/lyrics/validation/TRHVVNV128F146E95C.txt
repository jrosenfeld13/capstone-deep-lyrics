[Verse 1]
We're thoroughly spent, them bills are stacked up
The budgets bent and our credits jacked-up
People can't take it, they straight setting fires
Not trying to make no trouble they just wanna get hired

[Pre-Chorus]
The stress level's high and the morale's low
And when it's looking like it's about to blow
Your mind to the moon, stop what you're doing
Tap into your...

[Chorus]
Magic
Feels good soon as you add it
If you forgot you had it
Well, it's right where you at kid
Reach into you and drag it out
I'm talking bout that magic
However you can, you must grab it
Jump, sit still, sing, laugh, its magic

[Verse 2]
Were we just born to work rather born to live?
Still paying for your education when youre 66?
Mothers feel pressure to choose, fathers don't see their kids
Lovers can't remember the last time they kissed

[Pre-Chorus]
The stress level's high and the morale's low
And when it's looking like it's about to blow
Your mind to the moon, stop what you're doing
Tap into your...

[Chorus]
Magic
Feels good soon as you add it
If you forgot you had it
Well, it's right where you at kid
Reach into you and drag it out
I'm talking bout that magic
However you can, you must grab it
Jump, sit still, sing, laugh, its magic

[Bridge]
The stress level's high and the morale's low
The stress level's high and the morale's low
The stress level's high and the morale's low
And when it's looking like it's about to blow
Your mind to the moon, stop what you're doing
Tap into your...

[Chorus (2x)]

[Ad libs:]
Magic
People in love they got magic
Baby boy [?] you got magic
Baby girl you got magic
Big Sky got magic
Rei-Rei got that magic
Old folks got that magic
You next to me is magic
Every new breath I breath is magic
Magic, yeah
Magic, yeah
