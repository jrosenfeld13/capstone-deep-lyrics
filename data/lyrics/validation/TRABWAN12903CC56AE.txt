Dialing
It's me
Listen, something is wrong
The trace. It went dead. Two hours ago
...
I don't know
Everything was in place until then
One second it was there
And then he just disappeared
...
Don't blame me
I told them not to use the cheap stuff!
...
No, we have no idea
We've lost him completely
Later

Dialing
Listen
We found the hotel he was staying in
Somebody must have tipped him off
He was already gone
...
Listen! We tore down the whole place
There was an address on a slip of paper
It was the address of a bar
Hello? You still there? H e l l o?

In this place you cannot reach me
To save my mind, my flesh forever gone
I feel the way so deep inside me
So much to pay, but now I'm gone

Dialing
Good
So we went to this bar. He was in the back
...
Not really
His body. It was sprawled on the floor
...
I'm not sure
His gear was still there, but he erased his data
He must have used it only a minute before
...
We're still working on it
I think he found a way to escape to the other side
...
Yes, impossible. But I think he did it
...
We can't! Not now!
...
Alright. We'll tune in

In this place you cannot reach me
To save my mind, my flesh forever gone
I feel the way so deep inside me
So much to pay, but now I'm gone

In this place you cannot reach me
To save my mind, my flesh forever gone
I feel the way so deep inside me
So much to pay, but now I'm gone

Dialing
It's me
We've failed. He has vanished
Either he is dead, or he has switched over
...
Alright. We'll abort immediately
