It must be wonderful
To think you know it all
It must be beautiful
To really believe in you

But, I am constantly waiting
I am looking for your soul
I am constantly praying
I've come looking for you, looking for you

Blind man, you do what you can
You do what you can to be superman
Blind man, I'll do what I can
I'll do what I can to make you believe

You must be thrilled to bits
The happy hypocrite
And when you're out of it
The whole world is with you too

But, I am constantly waiting
I am looking for your soul
I am constantly praying
I've come looking for you, looking for you

Blind man, you do what you can
You do what you can to be superman
Blind man, I'll do what I can
I'll do what I can to make you believe
To make you see

But, I am constantly waiting
I am looking for your soul
I am constantly praying
I've come looking for you, looking for you

Blind man, you do what you can
You do what you can to be superman
Blind man, I'll do what I can
I'll do what I can to make you believe

I'll make you believe
(To make)
I'll make you believe
(You see)

I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe
