Blackie / Big Boss

Rodxx, oh Rodxx
You mustn't fight with Dygon !
He'll laugh at your sword, He'll crush you with his claws

My advice seems menacing
But only truth it tells
Our nation is hesding for undoing
And is past help

The Stone dominates us all
Vengeance is hidden in it
Your fight is already lost
There are no winners ! Nothing at all !

In the Black Stone from the thin air
That gave birth to Dygon
The power of thousands is concealed
Of alien world's creatures

Their strength knows, No boundaries
Oh Rodxx, it won't be a duel
Oh Rodxx, it won't be a duel
Death is facin death here !
