Tell me there's no room left to reason
Say it now if you dare
Time, precious time
That i do hope that you can spare
You say these words have no meaning
And this long wait you can't bear
Lines crossing lines
And we have not said a prayer

Tell me there's no room left to reason
And say it now if you dare
Lines, all these lines
But i do hope that you still care
Time, precious time
That i do hope that you can spare

California, stop on over
California
