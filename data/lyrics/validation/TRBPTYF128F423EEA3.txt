I'd like to sing to you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to sing to you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to sing, sing, sing, sing, sing to you

I'd like to dance with you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to dance with you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance with you

I'd like to sleep with you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to sleep with you, if you'd like me too
I'd like to sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep with you

Ribbons around the fumes, we'll be sleeping soon
