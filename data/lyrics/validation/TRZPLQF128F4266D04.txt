I suppose that there's no way
To break a broken heart
But you've been gone I don't know how long
I waited with open arms

Would you please put out your cigarette?
Cause the guest is getting sick of it
And you are acting like an idiot
Oh, won't you please put out your cigarette?, oh

And once I tried to close my eyes
And I thought you disappeared

Would you please put out your cigarette?
Cause the guest is getting sick of it
This room's a mess it's looking hideous
Oh, won't you please put out your cigarette?

Would you please put out your cigarette?
Cause I'm the guest I'm getting sick of it, oh
