It ain't always merry
To notice there's a line
Life is kinda scary
When you are left behind
All the loved ones lost to you
Used to be somewhere
You know you will follow too
And you don't really care to just go nowhere

And so you keep them all alive
(In your head)
I tell you I know The Reaper
No light and no eternal life
(What I said)
I tell you I know The Reaper

Sweetest of all lies
One of everlasting life
No one wants to die
But we do, so we hide
What you fail to realize
Is there's no need to fear
You live on in the hearts and minds
Of those who hold you dear, who are right here

And so you keep them all alive
(In your head)
I tell you I know The Reaper
No light and no eternal life
(What I said)
I tell you I know The Reaper

All the others
They already know The Reaper
All the others
They already know The Reaper

And so you keep yourself alive
(In your head)
You don't wanna know The Reaper
No light and no eternal life
(What I said)
I tell you I know The Reaper
