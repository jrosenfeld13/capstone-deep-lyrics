"Tomorrow you could be reborn
In an explosion of sensation
Is that what you want?
Sight and taste and sound
Burning up your new born baby soul...

Shed your skin
Maybe it would do you a service
Underneath
You know that it would be nothing to me

Tomorrow you could be reborn
Seize the oppertunity
Maybe useless flesh
Always dragged you down
Mirrors always breaking your soul

Shed your skin (shed your skin)
Maybe it would do you a service
Underneath (underneath)
You know that it would be nothing to me

Nothing masks our needs to be happy
No one crowds you out

Shed your skin (shed your skin)
Maybe it would do you a service
Underneath (underneath)
You know that it would be nothing to me

Nothing beats the one you were given
No one crowds you out..."
