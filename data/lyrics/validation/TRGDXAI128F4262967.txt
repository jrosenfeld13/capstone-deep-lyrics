["This is where you have to imagine the rest"]

Oh Louisa, oh my darling
It wasn't supposed to be this way
Who'd have thought, after all
It wasn't supposed to be this way

But I was wrong, (and here is where you have to
Imagine the rest)
Wrong
I was wrong, (It's different than words now)
On a missing person afternoon

It's a Monet, like a daydream
Glowing in the wandering light
You had an angle, I had mine
Needles in the haystack

But I was wrong (and here is where you have to
Imagine the rest)
Wrong
I was wrong, (It's different than words now)
On a missing person afternoon

I imagine where you are, I imagine what you can see
I imagine where you are, what you can see
I'll remember you, but I imagine
Almost in the same breath
The colors fade, in the dusk
You pull your sweater close around you

I was wrong, (there's a mystery on the road tonight)

Wrong
I was wrong, (and either way it's a leap of faith)
On a missing person afternoon
Missing person afternoon
Missing person afternoon
