Enslaved by the sea
You can't resist
Surrounded
By darkness
At powers devours
Your mind
Dark forces
Avenging the past

On a banished raft
Body so shrinked
Seared
This pungent stench
So abhoring
Fear
The ocean
Eradicates

Out of the dark
The flashing eyes
Hypnotise
Filled with disdaim
The ocean feels
Contemptuous
So profane
The oceand eradicates
