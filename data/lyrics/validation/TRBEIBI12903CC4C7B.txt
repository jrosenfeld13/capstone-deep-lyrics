(by Margaret A. Roche)

I'm losin' you
Fading from view

Aging and aching and raging and faking I'm

Losin' you
Losin' true

Last time I saw you I wanted to paw you
Not to destroy you now I just annoy you I'm

Losin' to
Accusin' you

When I first met you I failed to get you
Now that I let you come through I forget who I'm

Losin' out
Cruisin' about

The night of shining armor doesn't do her any favors

Make no mistake when mystiquing a make I'm

Losin' you
Choosin' to
