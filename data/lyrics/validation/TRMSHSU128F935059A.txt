Sometimes you get the bear
Sometimes the bear gets you
Sometimes you're gonna win
And sometimes you're gonna lose
But you know, in the end
It's all the same to me

Sometimes you fall on your head
Sometimes your head falls on you
Everyone I know
Is running around, feeling blue
But you know, in the end
There's no apologies

Let's go, now

Well, the monkeys in Madagascar
They'll all have a laugh at you
The cupholders in your new car
They'll think you're pretty funny, too
But you know, in the end
It's all a sight to see

Break it down

Sometimes you get the bear
Sometimes the bear gets you
Sometimes you're gonna win
And sometimes you're gonna lose
But you know, in the end
There's no apologies
