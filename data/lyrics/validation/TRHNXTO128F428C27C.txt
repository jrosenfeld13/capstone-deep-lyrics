When life is a road goin' nowhere
I'm alone, though you're gonna be right here
You're my baby
When life is a road goin' somewhere
All alone, I have to hold on to go on

I'm lookin' through my window
What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow

And maybe somebody someday
Turns back home, but it's gonna be a long way
It's been a long day
And maybe somebody someway
Highs and lows, it's always the same thing anyway

I'm lookin' through my window
What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow

I can't find the words, lose my nerve
And grass just turns to stone (Grass just turns to stone)
When all hopes are high, I have my pride
Show you what I'm really like inside

(I'm lookin' through my window)
What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow
I still can't see where's the rainbow
