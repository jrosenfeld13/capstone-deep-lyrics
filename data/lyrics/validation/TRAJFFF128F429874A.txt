[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall
Ain't nothing new to me
Don't get me wrong
I must say you gave up for this time now

[Chorus]
Stop tell me where you going
Maybe the one you love isn't there
You're going under
But you're over it all so you don't care about all that I had to see
I'd watch you wait until you come around
Around

[Verse 2]
Don't close your eyes
You need to see it all
It's no surprise
That they break you down
At least they won't give you up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's all wonderful
Living happily
To lose it all
Think you have everything

[Chorus][x2]
