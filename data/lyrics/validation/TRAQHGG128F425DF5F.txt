[Chorus: Brian Henderson]
The panics setting, the panics set in
The panics setting, and the panic is set
The panics setting, and the panic is set

[Verse 1: Brian Henderson]
There's a fire in your bed, and you've been trying to stab it out
There's a fire in your mind and its tearing your world apart
There's a lesson here to be learned
Learn it, learn it, learn it, write it down
There's a lesson here to be learned
Just write it down

[Chorus: Brian Henderson]
The panics setting, the panics set in
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)

[Verse 2: Brian Henderson]
There's a fire in your bed, and you've been trying to stab, stab, stab it out
There's a fire in your mind and it's tearing your world apart, woah
There's a lesson here to be learned
Learn it, learn it, learn it, learn it, learn it, learn it, write it down
There's a lesson here to be learned
Just write it down

[Chorus: Brian Henderson]
The panics setting, the panics set in
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
I would die for you
The panics setting, the panics set in
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
The panics setting, the panics set in
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
The panics setting, and the panic is set
(The panics setting, the panics set in)
