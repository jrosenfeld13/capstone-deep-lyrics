We came here to rock this jam
And spread his love is the master plan
And let this light ignite like a star
Cause everybody in the party knows who we are
You gotta get down, dance around, floss your style
P.O.D, guarantee, make it worth your while
Bad vibes leave 'em at the door
Soulcheck'n, housewreck'n, keep 'em begg'n for more

We came to rock the party all night long
From the left to right, and the back to front
So party people won't you sing that song
Gonna get, can I get one time
We came to rock the party all night long
And all the time because you know we got soul
And keep it live till the break of dawn

I say hey DJ won't you play that song
And we'll keep dancing till the break of dawn
And keep it live like the way it should
And ain't nobody gettin' crazy so you know it's all good
B-boys, fly-girls one time
A friend of yours is a friend of mine
Don't bother stopping till this jam is through
Cause if you been here before then you know how we do

We came to rock the party all night long
From the left to right, and the back to front
So party people won't you sing that song
To all ya'lls, everywhere, anywhere
We came to rock the party all night long
And to my brothers, I'll send it to my sisters
So party people with soul

We came to rock the party all night long
From the left to right, and the back to front
So party people won't you sing that song
Yeah.....................
We came to rock the party all night long
And everybody in the house one time
And keep it live till the break of dawn

Last time last time come on

We gots to play what we feel
So then I can say i came real
Don't wanna be caught messin' around
Because a party ain't a party when it gets shut down
Shut down, shut down
Off the hook with the cutz,thats right
I'm feelin' loose cuz it sounds so tight
We rock da spot till the very end
And make sure that you're there when we do it again
Come on

We came to rock the party all night long
From the left to right, and the back to front
So party people won't you sing that song
To all the people over here and over there
We came to rock the party all night long
To all ya'lls, everywhere, anywhere
And keep it live till the break of dawn
