Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin'
Cane
Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin'
Cane
I got another woman, baby yonder come your man
Your husband went to the wall and I know it was tuff
I don't know how you really feel, but I know you don't
Feel enough
So you look on yonder's wall and hand me down my
Walkin'
I got another woman, baby yonder come your man
Look on yonder's wall this wall and a hand me down my
Walkin' cane
Look on yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin'
Cane
I got another woman, baby yonder come your man
I love you baby but you just won't treat me right
Spend all of my money and walk the streets all night
So you look on yonder's wall, and hand me down my
Walkin' cane
I got another woman, baby yonder come your man
