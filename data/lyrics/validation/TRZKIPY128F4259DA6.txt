I know I prefer to hurt
It seems to comfort me and burn
I never asked for it - question
I never wanted it to end

I know that I die gracefully in vain
I know inside deteriorates in pain

You're such a part of me
I can't believe it's real

I crawl in my black box to hide
I welcome misery with pride
Takes turns in whipping me, I bleed
Enjoy the fantasy and greed

Oh my goth!
Subject me to your world
Oh my goth!
Take pleasure in my hurt
