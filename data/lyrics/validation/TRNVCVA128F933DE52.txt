I'm a song and I've waited so long
For someone to come and sing me
I've got a rhyme that I've had for some time
But nobody wants to sing me

Let me show the world that i;m not through
Let me touch your hearts the way I used to do

Sing me, sing me
I got a song to be sung
Sing me sing me
Roll me around on your tongue

I've got sunshine
I've got a message to shout
Sing me sing me
Won't someone please let me out

Would I make you smile if I came back in style?
Tell me, would you wanna sing me?
Don't say I'm gone, no, I wanna live on
Somebodies got to sing me

Let me fill the air with my old song
Have I let you down?
Tell me, where did I go wrong?

Sing me, sing me
I got a song to be sung
Sing me, sing me
Roll me around on your tongue

I've got sunshine
I've got a message to shout
Sing me sing me
Won't someone please let me out

Sing me, sing me
I got a song to be sung
Sing me, sing me
Roll me around on your tongue
