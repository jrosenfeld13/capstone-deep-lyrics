Adopting Sarah's heart
Was never gonna be easy
With an angel tattoo sinking beneath her belt
Sarah
And the dirty blonde seawater
Seawater gushing down
Chewing fingernails in her shit-eating grin
Sarah

They cut out her heart when
She was a little girl
And in a fishing boat she thought she saw the shadow of God
Sarah
He didn't smile at her and she decided
He never came at all
But when she died she was going nowhere

Sarah, I want to be like you
Sarah
You know, sometimes I want to live like you
Sarah
So, I know how it feels not to feel
Sarah

Adopting Sarah's heart
Was never gonna be easy
Changing from black to blonde to black to blonde
Sarah
But on the dirty tarmac of
The tarmac of a melting motorway
Gave me her clothes and told me to take her place
