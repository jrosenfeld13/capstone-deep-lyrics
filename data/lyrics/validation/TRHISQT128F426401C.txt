Sun going down, fight the traffic, put the key in my front door
Check my machine, grab a bite, put on clean clothes
See your picture there on the table
Suddenly everything stops
'Cause my heart is still wide open
Yes my heart is still open for you

Friends come around with their laughter, take me out drinking
Raise a glass, tell a joke, hear the band, Im lost
I remember two of us dancing
I remember holding you close
'Cause my heart is still wide open
Yes my heart is still open for you
Yes my heart is still wide open

Love doesnt just disappear along with a lover
'Cause youre always with me
Youre always with me wherever I go

Stumble in, drop all my clothes, I pull up the blanket
Toss and turn, dreaming, I'm running, your just out of reach
First cup of coffee at sunrise
My feet are glued to the floor
'Cause my heart is still wide open
Yes my heart is still open for you
Well my heart is still wide open
And my heart is still open for you
And Im hoping you will come through
