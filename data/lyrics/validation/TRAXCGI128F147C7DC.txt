Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
When the blues overtake me, gonna rock right away from here

Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
Well, I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home

Well,crap, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
Well, hold that kiss 'til I feel it in my head like wine

Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
She's so small she can mambo in a pay phone booth

Well, flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I got so many women I don't know which way to jump

Well, flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
