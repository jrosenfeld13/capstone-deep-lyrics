[Chorus]
I cry but I can't buy
Your Veteran's Day poppy

[Verse]
It don't get me high
It can only make me cry
It can never grow another son
Like the one who warmed me
My days after rain and
Warmed my breath, my life's blood
Screaming empty, she cries

[Chorus]
It don't get me high
It can only make me cry
Your Veteran's Day poppy

[Instrumental]
