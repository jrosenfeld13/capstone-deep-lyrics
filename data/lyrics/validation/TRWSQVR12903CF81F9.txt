It was all simple words, playful at best, so the story starts...
Who am I to say that she's missing out on anything worth effort these days?
She lays in an empty room unconscious as the day passes her by (that's not all, that's not all)

Right away we fell into each other head first, not even
The shallow sign could stop it when our souls met

Now it's up to us to keep this strong
Little did we know it's planted, something that would tear us apart

My hands fall all over you, not one moment goes to waste
This room turns to fire

Right away we fell into each other head first, not even
The shallow sign could stop it when our souls met

It was all simple words, playful at best, so the story ends....

I won't let go
The miles start to hurt
The days begin to kill
It's all in your eyes
It's the smell of your smoke perfume
Soon love turns to lust then back to nothing
It was all simple words playful at best, so the story ends
I felt the world in you the way you made time change
You got away with murder
You got away with murder

This is not with just raw emotion
From the hands of a man
Soon love turns to lust then back into nothing
