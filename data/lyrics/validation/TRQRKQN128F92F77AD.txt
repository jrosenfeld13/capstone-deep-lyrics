Kiss like drugs
Make me your picture
Tie me in ribbons
I won't forsake you
Make me your picture

Kiss like drugs
Make me your picture
Tie me in ribbons

Kiss like drugs
Your sweet kiss
Floods through my veins
Hold me down
Say my name

Kiss like drugs
Make me your picture
I'll be your distraction
I'll show you my mirror
Make me your picture

Kiss like drugs
Your sweet kiss
Floods through my veins
Hold me down
Say my name

Kiss like drugs
Love me, break me
Hold me, take me
Love me, break me
Make me your picture

Make me your picture

Kiss like drugs
Your sweet kiss
Floods through my veins
Hold me down
Say my name

Make me your picture
Make me your picture

Make me your picture
Tie me in ribbons
Kiss like drugs
I won't forsake you
Make me your picture
Kiss like drugs

Make me your picture
Tie me in ribbons
Kiss like drugs
I won't forsake you
Make me your picture
Kiss like drugs
