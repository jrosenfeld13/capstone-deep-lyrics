What sardony
This alien bitterness I'm fed
Deuteronomy Chapter 5, Verse 10, "I bestow mercy down to the thousandth generation, on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments"
They round us all up
They ordered us dead 100 thousand, thousand men, women, and children
Shackled like chattel. Beat 'til we bled. And they all said
Round 'em all up. round kill em dead
Cut off his hair
Cut off his head
Burn the remnants of what was left
Lie to their children while we all rape them
Whore all their women
Whore all their men
Pillage the beauty
Steal the brilliance that beats in the heart of every human
Do away with the firmament of the heavens
This is my response
An action an ideal a picture a thought
I bought the cross stationed in the wars I've fought. the souls that they've processed: An object
A loss
What heavens
Brilliance deadening
(Murder makes murder) Who ever heard of peace when they're carrying the dreaded beast in our bodies enemies never cease with their army. Pacify me try to calm me with your lies and crockery
Who look funny? run up in your piece with dark beats and black money
Act crummy
Feel the wrath
It's happening
The legacy of the backwards reckoning
The fools drumming to the beat of next coming
New world COINTELPRO operation. The process of inflation to end the nation of men who make revolution occupation
I've seen with my eyes the eclipse of hope and nothing but darkness
I and my brethren in this place displaced in disgrace my race your face As we're caught in a rift between the rapture of the new darkness and the dawning of light we lay barren like carrion
Exposed to sardony from the old enemy
Ending where it began
(ISRAELITES) we will come to understand and expand like the universe, in all directions
(ETHIOPES) seek and you will learn perspective
An elective course of human interactions
(MUST RETURN) Predilection to the enslaver's perversion?
What happened?
(TO THE FOLD) Wicked
Forces
Making latent hatred Akin to the satin races take in cake in all the raping killing hatred fiending aching wretched , villain, blatant, naked, nascent, waking, ancients, bleeding, god forsaken
TIL SANKOFA
PROTOCULTURE
Sustenance on the backs of men
Wickedness to satisfy your wicked ends
Swine, filthy beast just release what's within
What heavens
Brilliance deadening
