With Everyday that goes by
It sure gets lonely in this... this world of mine
This state of nothingness keeps on eating me
Will I succeed?

I can't help but wonder
What chapter is the next
I think I can't stop thinking
My mind just needs a rest
Has Everyone around me has lost their mind?
Need to think I'm crazy cause I'm real

I Don't have to think
It's under my skin
No one can stop my dream and I

I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
These odds are scaring me away
If you don't understand
Seems like no one can
Am I insane
Am I to blame

It seems everyday I lose more inspiration
I'm out of motivation
My life is going nowhere

With everyday that goes by
It sure gets lonely in this... this world of mine
I WILL SUCCEED!!
I WILL SUCCEED!!

I Don't have to think
It's under my skin
No one can stop my dream and iiiiiiiiiii
I Don't have to think
It's under my skin
No one can stop my dream and iiiiiiiiiiiii
