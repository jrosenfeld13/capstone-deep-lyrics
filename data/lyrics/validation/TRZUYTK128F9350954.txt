I've been insane well the time is slow
The Pope don't matter when the pawn
Is your sea
Don't you agree?
When you're around I'm wound
Around your thumb
You wanna be numb
Inside the gun

I've been in pain hope it doesn't show
I've been insane well the time is slow
Don't you want sunshine instead of phony lights?
All your billboards in lights
Are one big fight
Against the baby inside
That you've mistaken for pain
