I wish it didn't hurt, hurt like this
To say these things to you
I'll sacrifice one moment for one truth

If we get through tomorrow, then we'll be fine. (THEN WE'LL BE FINE!)
We'll wait for forever, AND SEE HOW CLOSE WE GET!

It's just another day, one more chance
To get this right
I'll sacrifice forever, please just for tonight

If we get through tomorrow, then we'll be fine. (THEN WE'LL BE FINE!
We'll wait for forever, AND SEE HOW CLOSE WE GET!
WE GET!

The worst is over for now...

Take a breath, now let it out!
The worst is over for now!
Take a breath, now let it out!
The worst is over for now!
