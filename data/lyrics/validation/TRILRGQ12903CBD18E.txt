I asked a little boy to call his daddy
He said he couldn't and sighed
And when I asked him what was wrong
Here's what the little boy replied

My Daddy is only a picture
In a frame that hangs on the wall
Each day I talk to my daddy
But he never talks at all

I tell him all of my secrets
And all of my little plans
And from the way he smiles at me
I know he understands

The angels took Daddy to heaven
When I was just goin' on three
But I'll bet they never told him
How blue and lonesome we'd be

I try to cheer up my mommie
When the tears roll down her face
My daddy is only a picture
But I'm tryin' to take his place
