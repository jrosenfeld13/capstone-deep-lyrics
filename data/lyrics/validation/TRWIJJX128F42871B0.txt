You want play, but the forecast for the weather
Just couldn't ever explain the rain
That leaves a mark for all of us to see
Cause we are alone and we won't escape the rain

It's left its mark on all of those who are known for
Known for playing games

Get in the fire with die-cast hardware
This forced emotion to never give a care
When the needle hits the skin
And the paper touches pen
I will let go of myself and do this all over again
Do this all again

Take my skin
I can't wait till you're in
So the whisper can erase my face (my face)
If you start to think of how
I traded love for hate
And why I chase the rain

Get in the fire with die-cast hardware
This forced emotion to never give a care
When the needle hits the skin
And the paper touches pen
I will let go of myself and do this all over again

The same old song
You want it but I am not yours
I am not yours

Get in the fire with die-cast hardware
This forced emotion to never give a care
When the needle hits the skin
And the paper touches pen
I will let go of myself and do this all over again, again
