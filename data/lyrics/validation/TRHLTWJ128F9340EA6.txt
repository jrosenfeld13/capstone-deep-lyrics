I once loved a lass and I loved her so well
I hated all others who spoke of her ill
But now she's rewarded me well for my love
For she's gone to be wed to another

I watched as my love did to the church go
With bride and bride-maidens she made a fine show
And I followed her on with a heart full of woe
To see my love be wed to another
To see my love be wed to another

I watched as my love did sit down to dine
I sat down beside her and poured out the wine
And I drank to the wee lass that should have been mine
For now she is wed to another

Oh stop says the groomsman if you take my word
Would you venture your life on the point of a sword
For courting too slowly you have lost this fair maiden
Begone you will never enjoy her
Begone you will never enjoy her

The lads of yon forest, they ask it of me
How many strawberries grow round the salt sea
But I answer them back with a tear in my eye
How many ships sail in the forest?

Go dig me a grave all large wide and deep
And cover it over with wild flowers sweet
And lay me down gently for to take a long sleep
For that's the best way to forget her

So we dug him a grave all large wide and deep
And covered it over with wild flowers sweet
And we laid him down gently for to take his long sleep
And maybe by now he's forgotten

And maybe by now he's forgotten
