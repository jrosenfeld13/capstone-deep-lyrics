When I open my eyes nowadays
And take a look at society
They're all just running around useless
They ain't got no identity
Call me a rebel, an outlaw
A devil with a dirty face
Well, at least I got a goal in life
So make room ??cause I'm coming your way

Fuck you, fuck you, I don't wanna be like you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and your system too
Fuck you, fuck you, don't care about the people today
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you anyway

Don't wanna be a part of your fashion show
'Cause we don't fuckin' care
It's time to face the music
You all just better beware
That we're pissed off and mad as hell
So fuck off with your fake ideals
You'll never understand us
For you we're much to real

Fuck you, fuck you, I don't wanna be like you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and your system too
Fuck you, fuck you, don't care about the people today
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you anyway

I don't care about to die

When I open my eyes nowadays
And take a look at society
They're all just running around useless
They ain't got no identity
Call me a rebel, an outlaw
A devil with a dirty face
Well, at least I got a goal in life
So make room ??cause I'm coming your way

Fuck you, fuck you,I don't wanna be like you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and your system too
Fuck you, fuck you, don't care about the people today
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you anyway
