I know you want to move
When you find the groove
Like a hurricane in my mind
Everybody is going
Everyone would come
If six was nine
You know I wouldnt really mind
Everybody is going
Everyone would come
Going down to Caf Luna
Find yourself together
I want to put it in
Sensation sensation
The doctor is coming
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Sensation sensation
Ray Fuzzy and Fred
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Gonna get to party
And find a thing to do
To get up in the morning
You know it is up to you
Gonna heed my feelings
Gonna make it on the floor
Gonna let them people show your thing
You got to do it more
Everyone would come
If six was nine
You know I wouldnt really mind it
Sensation sensation
The doctor is coming
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Sensation sensation
Ray Fuzzy and Fred
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Sensation sensation
Hiram is smoking
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Sensation sensation
Dopita on the saw
I think I like it
Never let it stop
Yeah, I like it like that...
Tear the roof off, we're gonna tear the roof off the mutha sucka
Tear the roof off the sucker
Sensation sensation
I think I like it
Never let it stop
