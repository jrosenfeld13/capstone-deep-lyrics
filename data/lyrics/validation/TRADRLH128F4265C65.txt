Woo!
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home

Never thought that I would hurt so bad
And ever since the day that I met you
All alone I sit 'cause I'm so sad
Don't you know this heart, it grieves for you?
There you were, holding back your love
Trying to make me feel real bad
'Cause your love I never had
I pray to her. (He loves you)
I needed her (he needs you)
I told her that (he wants you)
I want her back (he loves you)

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

All alone, don't you want to have some fun?
Don't you know, baby, I'm the one?
Just come with me and I'll make you feel
Don't you know, babe, this love is real?
There you were, holding back your love
All alone, you looking sad
But I know you want it bad
Deceiving me (he loves you)
What is the key? (He needs you)
Do you believe in me? (He wants you)
It's a disgrace, you see. (He loves you)

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now

Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
