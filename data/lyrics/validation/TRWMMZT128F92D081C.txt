Baby come and slide right next to me
I wanna feel you next to me
Theres something I can hold indefinitely
A loving soul thats meant to be
And wont well take our time unless you think
Theres something wrong but where to lead?
Exploring in the passion to the brink
To put our souls in ecstasy, oh baby I..
Dont, want, to, lose, this, feeling
Care to; lose, this, feeling, to
Say, Im, rolling, falling

So baby lets be bold and no be afraid
Baby this love could set you free
Why wont we take a chance unless you think?
Theres something wrong with magic lips, I know!
