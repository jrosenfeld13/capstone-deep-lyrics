I know there's much more behind reality
People walk and look at the sidewalk
Not at the sun

I know more
I want more

And if you look closer you'll see that the curtain's transparent
And you'll also see that
Secrets are not secrets
Anymore

Whom I'm talking to when I say you in a song
I felle blue and true
So I know whom is the you

I feel blue
I love you
Violet

And if you look closer you'll see that the curtain's transpartent
And you'll also see that
Secrets are not secrets
Anymore

I know there's much more behind reality
I want you to tell me the things you like in the world
I want you to tell me about the thing
You like and you feel and you want and you do
I want you to tell me those things
So tell me, tell me
Tell me please tell me
Tell me
