[Verse 1]
Yeah
It blew my mind into a million pieces
Pushed you aside
And still You got my back
Chapter one, page one
This is the part
Where I got weak
Fell in too deep
Every day and night
Got caught up in the hype
Started getting rough
But 'cause you showed me love
I'm gonna...

[Chorus]
Bounce
Bounce back
Shake it off
Get right on track
I'm moving on
Gotta put it in the past
Bounce
Bounce back
Snap your fingers
And just like that
I let it go
Gotta let it fade to black

[Verse 2]
Like a river
Cry all my tears
I have to swim through it
Dry it off
I'm outta here

[Chorus]
Bounce
Bounce back
Shake it off
I'm right on track
I'll be moving on

[Refrain]
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce back
Bounce back
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce back
Bounce back

[Verse 3]
Another day
Still playas out to run game
Trying to make me flow
To places I don't roll
Chapter two, page two
Happened again
Like dj vu
But it's brand new
Testing my faith
I won't make the same mistakes
So, playa
Drop the drama
I flipped the script
And now I'm gonna

[Chorus]
Bounce
Bounce back
Shake it off
I'm right on track
I'll be moving on

[Bridge:]
You...
You've been down since the day I've found you
There ain't no way that
I can do without You
It's off the chain the way I feel about you
I know I feel astray
Believe me when I say
This time, this time
I'm gonna be strong
This time
I'm gonna hold on

[Chorus 2]
All this time
I'm gonna
When you forgive a wrong
I'm leaving it alone
Gonna be bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bouncing on

[Refrain]
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce back
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce back
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce back
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce back

[Repeat Chorus]
