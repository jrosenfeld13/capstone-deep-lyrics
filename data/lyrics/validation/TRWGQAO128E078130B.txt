[Verse 1]
Ah, loving you is easy, you are on my side
We played the game strictly to our rules
We led the field, a love affair
Which made all other lovers fools

[Chorus]
Oh, how can you ever let me down? (down)
How can you ever let me down? (down)
How can you ever let me down?
These promises (a-ah)
Are made for us (o-o-oh, o-oh)

[Verse 2]
We promised that we'd always have time for each other
Whenever I needed, you'd be there
We promised to be true, there'd be no other
We promised that forever, we would care

[Chorus]
Oh, how can you ever let me down? (down)
How can you ever let me down? (down)
How can you ever let me down?
These promises (a-ah)
Are made for us (o-o-oh, o-oh)

[Bridge]
We had to change
Oh, but you stayed the same
You wouldn't change
Oh, what a shame!

[Verse 3]
'Cause loving you's not easy, you're not on my side
We play a game with two sets of rules
We lead the field in a love affair
Oh, strictly meant for fools

[Chorus]
Oh, why did you ever let me down? (down)
Why did you ever let me down? (down)
Why did you ever let me down?
Those promises (a-ah)
Were made for us (o-o-oh, o-oh)

[Verse 4]
You never have any time for me
Whenever I need you, you're not there
You've never been true and it's plain to see
The fact is, you never really cared

[Chorus]
Oh, why did you ever let me down? (down)
Why did you ever let me down? (down)
Why did you ever let me down?
Those promises (a-ah)
We made for us (o-o-oh, o-oh)
