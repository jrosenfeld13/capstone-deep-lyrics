[Verse 1]
In the morning, when I'm woken
By the sound of my alarm
Stretching out my arm
I want to screw it up in my palm

And I've taken this route to work
A thousand times or more
And when you've seen before before
You tend to get a little bored

[Chorus]
They've got the keys to all my doors (they've got the keys to all my doors)
They hold my where and when (they hold my where and when)
So I guess I'll always be (I guess I'll always be)
Hopelessly devoted to them

[Verse 2]
In the office when I'm working
There's a funeral atmosphere
I know I lost someone dear
But I didn't see him disappear

And I'm lying in my bed
'Cause it's keeping me awake
And you think there's no escape
They've bound me in red tape

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
Hopelessly devoted to them
Hopelessly devoted to them...
