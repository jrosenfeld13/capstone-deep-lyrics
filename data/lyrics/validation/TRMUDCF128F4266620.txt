EZ Rider, Oh you ez rider
Baby don't you see what you done done
You done gone and left me, while I lay sleepin'
Baby now you know your natural man done come
Baby now you know your natural man done come
I'm going to the country, Yes I'm goin' to the country
Yes I'm goin' to stay there, for a little while
You know I ain't good lookin', but don't let that deceive you
I talk about you like you sweet mama like you was a sweet angel child
Talk about you like you was an angel child
When you see me comin'
Baby when you see me comn'
Won't you tell that old man, (something)
You know I ain't no stranger to you baby
I been in your sweet lovin' arms before
Baby you know I've been in your sweet lovin' arms before
Hey rider, hey (something, something)
Woman where you been, where you been all night
You know your hair's all tanged, and your dress is all messy
And the shoes you got on baby, you ain't got your shoes on right
Baby you ain't got your shoes on right
