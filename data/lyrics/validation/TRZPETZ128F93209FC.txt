Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

Still hanging on (for what)
Can`t operate (fired up)
I won`t eat and i won't sleep for you yeah
No rest till i (get through)
Coz i`m holding out (for you)
Am i the only one who`s insane

Hey! you`re playing with my delirium
And the longer i wait the harder i`m gonna fall
Stop! playing with my delirium
Coz i`m outa my head and outa my self control

Still here in this quiet room
Deep in delusion sending me over
Outside watch the world go by
Inside time stands still as i wonder

Still hanging on (for what)
Can`t operate (fired up)
I won`t eat and i won't sleep for you yeah
No rest till i (get through)
Coz i`m holding out (for you)
Am i the only one who`s insane

Hey! you`re playing with my delirium
And the longer i wait the harder i`m gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
Coz i`m outa my head and outa my self control

(i won`t eat and i won't sleep for you yeah)

Hey! you`re playing with my delirium
And the longer i wait the harder i`m gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
Coz i`m outa my head and outa my self control
Hey! you`re playing with my delirium
And the longer i wait the harder i`m gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
Coz i`m outa my head and outa my self control
