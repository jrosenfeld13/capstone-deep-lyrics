He met Her stroke of luck few months
After His birth ...
Since they are the couple of life, they walk
Inseparable ... (foot by foot in the same shoes little bit wore of)
She's caring about Him so good - more than three
Times a week ...
They are so particular 'bout their privacy
- to be modest and lie about it ...
"I will rely on you, you make me too cold-blooded
Image ultimately" (said Mrs.Envy)
"I will rely on you, you make me as affectionate
Face as properly" (said Mr.Man)

So subservient is Mr.Man under pressure of Mrs.Envy!
They have so unequaled relationship, they are opinionless
And jealous, but they walk still so proudly!
Too fair masculine is Mr.Man and too bad feminine is Mrs.Envy!
Their familiar capitalism make some differences, make
Sacrifieces and low concessions ...

One day He met another man with His
Prettiest mood ...
She used Her cold-blood, She was spine-less with
Friendly look ...
That crime was invisible, She took Him part of energy
Concisiously ...
He felt that this truly proclaimed help Him live
Life with inner apathy and bigger tendency ...
"You are not responsive to know my repentance
And what I'm yearning for" (said Mrs.Envy)
"You feel my self-deprecating and send me reprimands
By your feminine scorn" (said Mr.Man)

So subservient is Mr.Man under pressure of Mrs.Envy!
They have so unequaled relationship, they are opinionless
And jealous, but they walk still so proudly!
Too fair masculine is Mr.Man and too bad feminine is Mrs.Envy!
Their familiar capitalism make som differences, make
Sacrifieces and low concessions ...

You got in to the second level of your inner apathy
What is the subsequent thing which make you
Vacillated?
I salute you Mr.Man for your great justice, which is
Accurately the same like readin' the yellow-press!
