I belong to no one, nobody belongs to me
And my experience of true love is a dear ol' memory
With no obligations to my friends or to my family
I'm as free as one can be
Free to come and I'm free to go
Everybody knows that I am not someone to rely on
Free to stay and I'm free to leave
I am free to be alone
But to be honest I have had enough of just fucking around
Now I'm desperately longing for
Something to slow me down
So If you ever get to know me, if you think you've got a chance

Then I'm begging you, please catch me if you can
My calendar is empty 'cause I never plan my time
Could some piece of mind really be that hard to find?
I will answer maybe, in case something would show up
I am gliding, and I don't know how to stop
But to be honest I have had enough of just fucking around
Now I'm desperately longing for
Something to slow me down
So If you ever get to know me if you think you've got a chance
Then I'm begging you
Please catch me if you can
