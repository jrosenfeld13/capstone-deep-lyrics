Nickeled and dimed and airbrushed, died broke and alone. One stroke, and then the other, my money's on the ticker. That ticker's failing fast. Grandpa the nickel, grandma the dime, both in the ground before plastic could improve their lives and no wood was too good and no man's word was either. Though nickel and dimed to death from behind, believers, they were believers. Wishing working praying plucking then struck dumb. Realize there exists no reward for what you do, let alone for what you've done. Kidnapped and duct-taped no repairs just made-to-break, postcards are better than the photos you take. Big bank eats little bank, fish outta water apes in a lake sinking while-you-wait to a grave mistake, oh heavens what a mouthful, through all this faithful believers, they were believers...
