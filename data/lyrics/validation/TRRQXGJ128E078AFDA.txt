[Verse 1]
Look in to my eyes
You will see what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
Oh, when you find me there you'll search no more

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true, everything I do, I do it for you

[Verse 2]
Look in to your heart, you will find
There is nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There is no love, like your love
An' no other could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless your there
All the time, all the way

[Verse 3]
You can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I just can't help it, there's nothin' in the world I want more
Oh, I would fight for you, yeah, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you

You know it's true, everything I do, I do it for you
