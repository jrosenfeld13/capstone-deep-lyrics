God only knows all the side effects of listening to static on the radio
Stare at the screen til the videos have driven you to lunacy with visuals

I cant believe you sold
I cant believe you sold out
Rip your soul out
Rip your soul

Would you face me and look into my eyes
Before you lie straight through your teeth
And maybe youll pull it off again
But you can count me out

Look to the sun
For the energy youre gonna need
While fighting for your legacy
Take it and run
So theyll never know the holy ghost
Is not in you and never was

I cant believe you sold
I cant believe you sold out
Rip your soul out
Rip your soul

Would you face me and look into my eyes
Before you lie straight through your teeth
And maybe youll pull it off again
But you can count me out

Cant believe youre selling out
Know we bury all our useless
We bury all out useless every day

Would you face me and look into my eyes
Before you lie straight through your teeth
And maybe youll pull it off again
But you can count me out

Theyre so tasteless
Changing
To be the one they want
Faceless
Wasted
You dont know who you are
