Cowboy lawman-found a cell
Tore into it-as night fell

Bankers kids are
Getting bingo'd
Smells like midnight's
Cooked up a storm in here
Leave those loose lips
At home or at the
Rubble that's left
When you return

Have an armed guard posted at your flag
Stroll through town with
A gun stuffed in your pants

Bankers kids are
Getting bingo'd
Smells like midnight's
Cooked up a storm in here
Leave those loose lips
At home or at the
Rubble that's left
When you return

Criminal lawman-found a cell
Tore into it-made life hell

Bombs bursting-houses burning
Diplomacy's tyrant treats
