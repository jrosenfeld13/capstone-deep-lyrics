Feel I'm trying to swim the north atlantic ocean
I'm traveling on a different kind of train
Heaven saves a place for fallen angels
I need someone to take me home again

Stay the night
Baby say you love me
Stay and love me
Stay the night
Stay the night
Need you to need me
Say you need me
Stay the night

I'm living with a clock for a companion
Waiting for the telephone to cry
If you stay and love me till the morning
Maybe we won't ever say goodbye

Stay the night
Baby say you love me
Stay and love me
Stay the night
Stay the night
Need you to need me
Say you need me
Stay the night

It takes a while to know just where you're going
And sometimes you get lost along the way
And since I feel the need inside me growing
I hope that you won't mind it when I say

Stay the night
Baby say you love me
Stay and love me
Stay the night
Stay the night
Need you to need me
Say you need me
Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night
