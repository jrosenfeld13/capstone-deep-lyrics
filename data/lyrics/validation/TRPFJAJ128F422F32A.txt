[Verse 1]
When I'm lying in your bed
Play the motions through my head
You know that I'm thinking, I'm thinking
And I have reasons to believe that
I'm not the only one you spend this time with
But Ill stay

[Chorus]
You say you're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down
You lie through your teeth
You smile in your sleep
You smile in your sleep

[Verse 2]
When we met
You said we were the same
You know that we're different, we're different
And all the times you promised me that
Everything would work out in the end
You were gravely mistaken

[Chorus]
You say you're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down
You lie through your teeth
You smile in your sleep
You smile in your sleep

You lie, you lie, you lie, you lie
You lie through your teeth
You won't let me down
You lie, I deserve better than this

[Bridge]
I dream of steel
Maroon and warm
Your end, your end
You gasp for air
I'll see this through, I'll see through you
Your pale, your pale
Your pale blue eyes

When you're lying in your bed
Your eulogy's been read
You know that it's fitting, you lie

[Chorus]
You smile, you smile, you smile, you smile
I deserve better than this
