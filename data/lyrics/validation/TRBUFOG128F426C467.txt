And if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you
Well you're just another puppet, she's not even keeping score
And the lazy way she cheats you leaves me cold
She'll laugh about you, my best friend, but you don't know

'Cause if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you

She spends her daddy's money
And she drives her daddy's car
And what's crazy is the way you think that's style
And all the while my heart is breaking
You're not even on her mind

'Cause if you knew what I know
Babe you wouldn't leave me
You wouldn't turn away from my love
It's what you said that you believed in

I say this as your friend
You'll be the poor boy in the end
