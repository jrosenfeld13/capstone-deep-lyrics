She was to warm my cold heart
To love her, to be for her
I killed her with my sight
I was lost in her eyes

My sight makes flowers fade away
I'm waiting for the rain to come
For tears that will dissolve my pain
And fill my withered heart again

And wind is cold so much
A large cloud was to cover the sun
And I wash the filth away

She was to warm my cold heart
Fo love me, to be for me...

My sight makes flowers fade away...
And fill my withered heart again...
