The train is comin' at 6:05
And I'll be gettin' on it to take a long ride
Back to an apartment so empty inside
With loneliness the only thing that's waiting

I bought my ticket today
I just paid for one way
The price was too high for returning

I have spent all my love
Getting none in return
I bought a ticket to nowhere today

And I still hear her voice
As it rings in my brain
Telling me she's in love
Oh, yes, well, really

That she's been hurt before
That's what first love is for
But now she's found the kind of love
That she's been needing

She's standing there so shy
Feeling nothing inside
Not seeing the pain my eyes are trying to hide
For her, it was fun, but it's all said and done
No love left in the silence of goodbye

And I still hear her voice
As it rings in my brain
Telling me she's in love
Oh, yes, well, really

That she's been hurt before
That's what first love is for
But now she's found the kind of love
That she's been needing

I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
