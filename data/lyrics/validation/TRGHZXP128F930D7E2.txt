Bursting metal - chroming eagles in the night
In a flying battle - fighting monsters side by side

Into the light we are guided by our own destiny
Keeping the course nothing can stop us at all

Forever we will follow the light
Although we'll burn in nuclear fire
As we can see on our last flight
It will take us one step higher than we were

Striking squadron - crushing tanks on our trail
There is no weapon - radar rockets bound to fail

Setting the pace we deploy to destroy our enemy
Keeping the course nothing can stop us at all

Forever we will follow the light
Although we'll burn in nuclear fire
As we can see on our last flight
It will take us one step higher than we were

Taking no prisoners and bring no survivor
We are the soldiers of death
Painful and cruel we destroy our rival
Violence is catching his breath

Forever we will follow the light
Although we'll burn in nuclear fire
As we can see on our last flight
It will take us one step higher

Forever we will follow the light
Although we'll burn in nuclear fire
As we can see on our last flight
It will take us one step higher than we were
