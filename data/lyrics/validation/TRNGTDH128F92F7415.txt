I control the sun, I turn on the stars
I make all the colors that you see as you circle me
I open up the sky, I control the speed
I can make the green lights flash, I can make you crash

Barely makes a sound
You stop when you slow down
But I can't make you
See things the way I see things
I can't make you
Feel things the way I feel them
I can't wait around for you
I've got better things to do

'Cause I control the sun, I cool down the heat
I can make the walls spin around and raise the ground
I control the world, I can make it flat
I can make the water deep so I can save you from the sea

Stop when you seem down
Afraid that you would drown
But I can't make you
See things the way I see things
I can't make you
Feel things the way I feel them
I can't wait around for you
I've got better things to do

I pushed every button, I pulled every string
I've tried every lever, I've tried everything

Barely makes a sound
You stop when you slow down
Now I can't make you
See things the way I see things
I can't make you
Feel things the way I feel them
I can't wait around for you
I've got better things to do

No, I can't make you
See things the way I see things
I can't make you
Feel things the way I feel them
I can't wait around for you
I've got better things to do

'Cause I control the sun
I control the sun
If I can control the sun
Then why can't I have you?
I've got better things to do
