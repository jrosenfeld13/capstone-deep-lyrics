[Verse 1]
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped right over the candle stick
To a flame he chose had a name called hell
Where the devils child drank blood and was always well

[Verse 2]
Jack lived simple with his lady Jill
'Till he came on home his she stole
He caught her messin' with another man
So he got his gun and shot them down

[Verse 3]
Close to Jill lying there
All alone
He lost his mind beneath the stairs
All alone

Jack be nimble Jack be quick
Jack jumped right over the candle stick

[Verse 4]
Close to Jill his broken crown
All alone
See the growth stalk the goat
All alone

We were young [x16]
