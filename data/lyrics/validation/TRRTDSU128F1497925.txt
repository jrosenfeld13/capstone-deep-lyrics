[Verse 1]
Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

[Verse 2]
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

[Bridge]
Lonely
Lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

[Verse 3]
Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
