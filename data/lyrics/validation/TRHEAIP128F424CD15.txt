I don't wanna hear your voice anymore
I don't want you around
I don't wanna see you sitting in my Favorite armchair
I hope we'll never meet in town
(Relax...)

I wish you know how I trusted in you
Too bad: you'll probably never know
I trusted in you...

Deceiver

You played the part of a well-dressed alter ego
You were my well-dressed alter ego

I trusted in you
Well-dressed alter ego
I don't want you around
