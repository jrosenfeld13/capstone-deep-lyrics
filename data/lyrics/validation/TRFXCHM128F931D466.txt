[Intro: Slim Thug]
You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangsta's
Go head girl, put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Hook: Beyonc]
Ohh boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'm-a let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Oohhh you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I might let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

I'm checking on you boo, do what you do
And while you dance, I'mma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance, all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
If won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see this one's mine
It's Slim Thuga and DC outta H-Town
