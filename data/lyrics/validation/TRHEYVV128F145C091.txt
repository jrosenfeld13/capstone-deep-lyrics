They asked you if you're alright
You say yes
But all the time you know
It's a mess
It's 5 PM and you're on your way home
Just another day with that endless grey drone

Three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero

Drag yourself along the road
Sit on the bus
Switch on your transistor
Cause a fuss
It's 11 PM and you're on your way home
Just another night with that endless grey drone

Three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero

I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
A three minute hero

Three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero

A three minute hero, I wanna be
A three minute hero, I wanna be
A three minute hero, I wanna be
A three minute hero

It's too early in the morning
Stupid job
Don't wanna eat, can't think straight
Same as yesterday
It's 7 AM and you're leaving home
Just another day with that endless grey drone

Three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero
I wanna be, a three minute hero

A three minute hero, I wanna be
