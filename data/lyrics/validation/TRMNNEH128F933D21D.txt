Well, I've been walking to ease my mind
Had my doubts but left them behind
Believed you baby, when you said it was through
That's when I should've never trusted you

And it's, too long to late for you to arrive
I've been, for some reason, with you on my mind
Been working my fingers to the bone
Only to find that you weren't alone, honey

Well, I've been lonely and I've been down
You've got no business honey hanging 'round
I need time, time to think
To jump the boat, before our love sinks

And it's, too long to late for you to arrive
I've been, for some reason, with you on my mind
Been working my fingers to the bone
Only to find that you weren't alone, honey

Just a job to do, that'll never get done
Just another truth, that's already gone

Well it's, too long to late for you to arrive
I've been, for some reason, with you on my mind
Been working my fingers to the bone
Only to find that you weren't alone

And now, too long to late for you to arrive
I've been, for some reason, with you on my mind
Been working my fingers to the bone
Only to find that you weren't alone....
