A world of hate
She's heard the thunder, felt the rain, she's losing faith
The smell of human sin covers the beach
It's hard to explain
And as she sees the waves explode, her hope drifts further from the shore
Packed with persistence, she walks on
Wow. You're killing me
A tragic moment fades to grey, not crumbling in another day
As her mind freezes to numb, she knows that she'll be back again
And as she sees the waves explode, her hope drifts further from the shore
Packed with persistence, she walks on
Wow. You're killing me
The coldest sounds, they echo your heartbeat
The moon and stars, they highlight your beauty
So you and I remain alone
This world has never felt like home
I'm sick of being tired
Wow. You're killing me
