This Is My World...
Everybody, This Is My World
And I Live Upon My Landscape
Inside A Dream Of My Creation
Product Of My Imagination
I Am The King Of My Own Nation

My World
An Overload Of Endless Wonder
For A Design Of Grand Delusion
Into A Private Life Seclusion
How I Delight In Such Confusion

This Is My World
'Cause This Is My World
And This Is My Time
I Live In My World
I Live In My Mind
'Cause This Is My World
This Is My World - Woah
'Cause This Is My World
This Is My World - Woah

My World
I Have A View Into Your Bedroom
Where I Can Watch You With Desire
With All The Passion You Inspire
Inviting Your Secret Admirer

This Is My World
'Cause This Is My World
And This Is My Time
I Live In My World
I Live In My Mind
This Is My World

'Cause This Is My World
This Is My World - Woah
'Cause This Is My World
This Is My World - Woah
