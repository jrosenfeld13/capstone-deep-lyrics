Out where the mist transforms the slate
Into an alien landscape
Wanting for only the whirrs and the clicks
Of the quatermas sound effects
Peacefully alone
No bars on my phone
Natures architecture
Leaving behind the violence the crimes
The island etc....
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Remember me for who I am, not what I'll become...
Recast the role written for me
Can I still love a city?
Offering the world more than it can accept
In the settlement of a debt
Isolated on the pyramid of information
Now chinese whispers fall on deaf ears
Pay them no attention
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Remember me for who I am, not what I'll become...
