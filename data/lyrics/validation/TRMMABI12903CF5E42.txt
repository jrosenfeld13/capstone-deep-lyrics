I knew you all my life
Though only through my dreams
Look inside your mind
And see what's on mine
Calling out my name
I see you there
This frozen cold
It isn't fair
How much of this pride will I spare
We both are seething

All I know
Is to act now
And hold on
This one's the real one
Just calm down
Don't look back
This is what we never had
I never felt so alive till I saw blue eyes
Until now it wasn't hard to leave
I'm wanting more

Everyone around
But still alone
Try to grasp losing the flow
Use a single emotion
You left me totally motionless
So quick so soft like a thief in the night
Came here and changed my life
Everyday the same
Just sit and stare
Will I see you up in the air
These separate lives we don't share
Again I'm leaving

All I know
Is to act now
And hold on
This one's the real one
Just calm down
Don't look back
This is what we never had
I never felt so alive till I saw blue eyes
Until now it wasn't hard to leave
I'm wanting more

I thought all this time
I would end up alone
Beside you I lay
Watch you breathing

All I know
Is to act now
And hold on
This one's the real one
Just calm down
Don't look back
This is what we never had
I never felt so alive till I saw blue eyes
Until now
I never felt so alive
It wasn't hard to leave
I'm wanting more
