Oh, hey
Yeah

I've been wanderin' 'round in the dark
Been lost somewhere where no
Light could shine on my heart
I have known a pain so deep
But I know my faith will free me

Get there and I'll get through this
Get there I'll find my way again
So don't tell me that it's over
Cause each step just gets me closer

[Chorus]
I will get there, I will get there
I will get there, I will get there somehow
Cross that river, cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there, get there, get there, get there

I've been in these chains for so long
I'll break free and I'll be there where I belong
Hold my head up high, I'll stand tall
And I swear this time I won't fall

Get there I will do this
Get there no matter what it takes
'Cause I know no limitations
And I'll reach my destination, I will get there

[Chorus]
I will get there, I will get there
I will get there, I will get there somehow
Cross that river, cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there, get there, get there, get there

Well, the night is cold and dark
But somewhere the sun is shining
And I'll feel it shine on me
I'll keep tryin', I'll keep tryin'

[Chorus]
I will get there, I will get there
I will get there, I will get there somehow
Cross that river, cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there, get there, get there, get there

I will get there, I will get there
I will get there, I will get there somehow
Cross that river, cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there, get there, get there, get there
