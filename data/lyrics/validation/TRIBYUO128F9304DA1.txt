In the hand and in the sleight, all the cruel tricks of the light
And in the cancel of the hum, in the ringing finally gone

You cool my blood until it creeps
Build the tension and release under an inter-constellation fracas

We are getting older, are getting older and slower...

A slow wave and slower in motion
You crash with music and maths, syllables and graphs
Braving the elements to swim
A cold current to carry me in, I'm ready to begin again

I'm ready to begin again

Now and every shining time you were ghostly and mine
I was the pallor of your dreams and a harbour of fears
I'll be a cheat, be a lay, these no halcyon days
And a heart caught in suspended animation
And getting slower, getting older, slower

A slow wave and slower in motion
You crash with music and maths, syllables and graphs
Braving the elements to swim
A cold current to carry me in, I'm ready to begin again

I'm ready to begin again
