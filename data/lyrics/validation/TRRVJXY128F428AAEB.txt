Something's gotta change again
I'm losing
My inspiration's gone
Oh no, oh no
Seeing through some different eyes
I can't find
My medication failed
Again, again
I can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?
See it on the street
Watching heat from the pavement

Cause I'm here
Ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day

Faces in the crowd
Fake smiles for miles
My imitation's wrong of them, again
Trapped inside this cheap hotel
Bored as hell, turning the channels 'round
In my head, in my bed
I can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?
I see it on the street
Watching heat from the pavement

Cause I'm here
Ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day, day

I can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?
See it on the street
Watching heat from the pavement
I can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?
I'm not the same
Not the same, lost my feeling

All I know I'll never know
All I know I'll never know

Cause I'm here
Ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day
Every beautiful day, every beautiful day
Every beaut-i-ful day
