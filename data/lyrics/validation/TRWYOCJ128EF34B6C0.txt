Please introduce yourself
Let's shock the world with what we know
Squeeze the world
'Til it's small enough to join us heel to toe
(Heel to toe)

International bright young thing
Now you know for sure that you make the world swing
International bright young thing
Make it swing

High in the air between here and there
Somewhere anywhere
(Anywhere but here)
I feel that I'm always home and I'm
Never in love
(Never in love with fun)

International bright young thing
Now you know for sure that you make the world swing
International bright young thing
Make it swing

Icicles dropping wishes while
Sun is making wishes while
I gaze up there somewhere
Like a zombie, yeah

I'm so tired I can hardly think
So I feel instead and let you loose
Inside my head
(Inside my head)
I hear you yelling it to me
Spelling it out to me
When I thought I came from nowhere
I came from everywhere instead
(Everywhere instead)

International bright young thing
Now you know for sure that you make the world swing
International bright young thing
Make it swing
