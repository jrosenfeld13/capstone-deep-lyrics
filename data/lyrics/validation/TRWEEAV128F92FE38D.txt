Dear one, the world is waiting for the sunrise
Every rose is covered with dew
And while the world is waiting for the sunrise
In my heart is calling you

Dear one, the world is waiting for the sunrise
Every little rose bud is covered with dew
And my heart is calling for you
The thrush on high, his sleepy mate is calling
And my heart is calling you
