You are my best idea
The moment I became inspired
And we've created something special here
A love to take us through the years

Our hearts are in the right place
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Some kind of magic taken over me
I feel this wave of ecstasy baby

We can make miracles together
Were supernatural tonight
A real life fantasy
The first time I saw you I knew
I'd found a miracle in you

An everlasting sun that shines
We are reborn again
Look what we've begun
Two worlds have now become as one

We can make miracles together
Were supernatural tonight
A real life fantasy
The first time I saw you I knew
I'd found a miracle in you
