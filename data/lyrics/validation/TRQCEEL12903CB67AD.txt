Of love and hate. Related to the roman Venus and married to the smith-god

Sky was steering waves, the night cruel foam created me
NOW YOUR TIME HAS COME
They fought over my hand, soon armies fell down to their knees
FIND THE CHOSEN ONE
Legend of all time
Aphrodite shines
Goddess of love and pain
Driving the gods insane
Goddess of love and pain
All of their hope's in vain
Trojan warriors mean, the bloodiest I've ever seen
MISERY AND DEATH
Enticed by the lights of hate, unable to stay clean
THEY CAN'T TAKE MY BREATH
Legend of all time
Aphrodite shines
Goddess of love and pain
Driving the gods insane
Goddess of love and pain
All of their hope's in vain
