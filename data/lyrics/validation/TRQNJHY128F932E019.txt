He's the Sovereign
Knows everyones heart
Has known it from the very start
Create the stage with guilt and regret

The diagnosis unheeded
Therein lies a cure that concedes to sickness
Healing for those who desire it

Today is the day
Acknowledge and stay
Wear the sackcloth and scatter the ashes

Like a scholar in the dark accuses
God in the dock will see through all excuses
The ancient man came forth and touched
The robe with great respect and feared

Steer them right
Lead them onward and over the shrine
Son of Leah, you are not alone
Breathe, sarcophagus

A cry of a vulture, a cry of a man
