You've broken every bond but
You still don't understand
My trust is long gone
There's nothing good to build
On a foundation that weak
A waste of words, of energy
Now it's time to burn bridges
You're fading out
Slowly vanishing
Fading out
The echo disappears
Fading out
A little more each day
But not fast enough for me
Fading out
Slowly vanishing
Fading out
The echo disappears
Fading out
A little more each day
Erased, from the past
I don't need a snake in the grass
