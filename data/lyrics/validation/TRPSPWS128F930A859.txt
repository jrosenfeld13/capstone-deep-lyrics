I get you out of my life
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna load my gun
In the name of love
And point it right at you

I'm gonna take you out
I'm gonna make you cry
After what you done
You'll be lucky if
You get out alive

I'm gonna bring you down
I'm gonna see you crawl
I'm gonna pick you up
So I can watch you fall
That's what you done to me
And I return it all
And get you out of my life

I'll never play your game
I'm gonna break the rules
I'm gonna make you pay
For what you put me through
I'm gonna tell you every reason I hate you
And get you out of my life
