Who do you think you work for, your family or the banks?
The ones who take forty years with nothing but a thanks
The ones who owned your parents are the ones who'll own your kids
The ones who offer the right to work, but no right to live
We can see them in the windows that overlook the floors
Laughing on the telephone while we perform their chores
We never see their faces, but their names are on our checks
Their parasitic purse strings are a noose around our necks

They're terminators, they can take your life from you
They're terminators, they can put an end to you

We ask about their families, we laugh at their stupid jokes
It's better to be on their good side to borrow when you're broke
They're the ones who sign our paycheck and the ones who own our homes
The ones that we go begging to when looking for a loan
They feed upon our miseries and toss a couple crumbs
And praise their own benevolence for helping out the scum
If you dare to raise your voice, they'll shove you off the lot
And send you slumping home to our cities full of rot

They're terminators, they can take your life from you
They're terminators, they can put an end to you

They flash a slimy smile while promising a change
They're rich, lazy vampires sucking blood from our veins
And they make all the profit from our work and from our sweat
And we accept their wages, because that's all we'll ever get
We've buried our fathers with the pennies they saved
Is this our future from our cradles to our graves?
They never give us a chance, and I guess they never will
Fifty years later will terminators own us still?

They're terminators, they can take your life from you
They're terminators, they can put an end to you
