Today the sun came up again
And this colossal wrong began
And suddenly there wasn't any shine left in the sun
You're turning off the sun
You're turning off the sun
By turning off your love

To feel the sunshine of your love
Become so colourless and numb
Suddenly there wasn't any shine left in your sunshine
You're turning off your love
You're turning off your love
Like turning off the sun

It's so colossal
It's so impossible
It's so impossibly colossally impossible to me!
