I don't wanna die
In a car crash with you
Tonight
Tonight

The roads are wet
And you're asleep at the wheel
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

Can't you try and wait
Till I'm wide awak
Or will it never come

And if it was a dream
Did you hear me scream
While you watched me sleep

The nighttime roads
Feel like we're floating away
Keep me safe
Kepp me safe

And if we make it home
Then I will know
I'm still asleep
Still asleep

Can't you try and wait
Till I'm wide awake
Or will it never come

And if it was a dream
Did you hear me scream
While you watched me sleep

I'm almost home
I can't make it on my own
Almost home
Baby don't go
Out on the roads
Tonight

I had a terrible dream
But it was only a dream
So don't worry about me
