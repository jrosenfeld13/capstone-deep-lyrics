Man! I Fell Like a Woman!

I'm going out tonight--I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise---really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

No inhibitions--make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

BRIDGE:
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...

CHORUS:
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy--forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts--short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild--yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action--feel the attraction
Color my hair--do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free--yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!

The girls need a break--tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance--we only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down

(BRIDGE)

(CHORUS)

(BRIDGE)

(CHORUS)
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman
