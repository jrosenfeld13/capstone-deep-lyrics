I took your love, and said, "Goodbye"
I stayed away, my darling and made you cry
If you turn me away, yeah yeah, all I can say
Is that two wrongs don't make a right

I broke your heart, you know it's true
Now I'm back begging you
Not to turn me away 'cause all I can say
Is that two wrongs don't make a right

Now is your chance to do me wrong
And to tell me that this is the end
Now, my darling, if you can forgive until the longest day I live
I will never make that same mistake again

I took your love, and said, "Goodbye"
I stayed away, my darling and made you cry
'Cause if you turn me away, baby, yeah yeah, all I can say
Is that two wrongs don't make a right

Please don't turn me away, baby, 'cause all I can say
Is that two wrongs don't make a right
You know if you turn, you just turn me away, yeah, all I can say
Is that two wrongs don't make a right
