[Verse 1]
Time stands still for no one
I know this is true
I've been stuck here waiting
Then along came you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew

[Chorus]
I want to thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive
That I could fly
I could fly, oh

[Verse 2]
There's no way I could've made it this far
Without you
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe
That I could make it through
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Above the clouds
Fly so high, never come down
Just you and I, I'm so in love
With you, with you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 4]
And I could fly, I could fly, oh
I want to spread my wings
Let me tell you
Said I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, and I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Yeah I need your love, and I need your love
Stay with me honey baby, Come on now stay
Come on now, yeah

[Outro]
You and me side by side walking through the woods in the pale moonlight
Oh yeah now and it feels so good
