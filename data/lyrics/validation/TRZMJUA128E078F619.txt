I thought I found someone
I thought I had something I could trust
I still can't believe what happened
It's not that you lied to us
It's not that your friendship was a fraude
It's just that I can't see the real in you

Yeah for years I was afraid
Now I can finally say

That I'm afraid that you've become
Everything that you had hated
I'm waiting
For this to blow away

How could I have been so blind
How could I've ignored so many signs
Especially when my friends warned me
About your deceptive side
And that your friendship was a lie
But still I cannot see the real in you

Yeah for years I was betrayed
Now I can finally say:

(chorus)
I've been working for
Something oh-so fake
But it's never too late

To correct the faults
So many others made
I know you don't care
About what's right or fair

I heard you say your future is looking
So great

(chorus)
I've been working for
Something oh-so fake
But I'm not working for you no more
