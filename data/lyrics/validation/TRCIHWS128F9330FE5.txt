[Chorus]
There goes the man who gave his heart to someone
I feel sorry for him
For that someone just gave her heart to me

[Verse 1]
Now, he's the loser and it hurts so much to lose
An' I feel sorry for him
Cause the loser, I know, could have been me
Oh, how he loved her, I'm sure he must have loved her
Almost as much as me
But fate has frowned on him
Then turned around and smiled on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If things were different, if he had won her heart
Instead of me
I wonder if he'd find the time
To offer sympathy

[Chorus]
