Let go, it's a hard, hard lesson to learn
Let go, it's a very hard lesson you learn

Like a blind man run down a highway
Is a very good friend of mine
And I'm runnin', I'm yellin', I'm tryin' to catch him
But I keep on fallin' behind

Let go, it's a hard, hard lesson to learn

Like a clown stuck out on a high wire
Is a very good friend of mine
Losin' his sense of balance
Reachin' a hand for mine

Let go, it's a hard, hard lesson to learn

Like the empty glass on the table
Is a very good friend of mine
Askin' me if I need one more
Starin' straight into my mind

Let go, let go, let go, let go
