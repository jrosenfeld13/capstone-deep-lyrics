Broken guitar. Broken amps and dreams
I felt old a long time ago but now the rest of the world's gotten older than me
So what's the deal here?
Are you too old to get there?

Are you too lazy to get here?
Too lazy to even stay in touch?
No calls inside those walls
A simple "how are you" is a little much to ask of you
So I'll go on without you

Take my chances and go it alone
I hate people anyway

Pile up in a dumpster
Light that match and burn it up
And run away to somewhere safe
Rubber tires are grounded and go from place to place
You cannot live here
You've already died here

Take my chances and go it alone
I hate people anyway

Don't give up on the first thing you believe
Take my chances and go it alone
I don't need this shit anyway

I don't wanna wake up to an alarm clock thinking "Well, what the fuck. I've done enough. Time to stop livin' and start giving up."
I know I'll have to or just go on without you
Take my chances and go it alone
I hate people anyway
