[Verse 1]
My sleep burrows me a chain of monochromatic rooms
That jangles in the day and recalls a samey drone
Day has drawn out from the night
What's been lacking in its wage
Reviving eyes that choked the light
With no extraction for the page

[Chorus]
I cannot seem to remember my dreams lately

[Verse 2]
If the moon defines the night and illuminates without direction
Could the obscured that steered my life illuminate its intervention?
I fought so long for an explanation
Planting, the seeds that took root in my mind
Explaining, into dust what was a lucid situation

[Chorus]
And I cannot seem to remember my dreams lately
