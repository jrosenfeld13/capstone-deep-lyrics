Tonight, can you hear us
Tonight, we are movin'
Pack your bags, preparation to move we see the coming of our God oh so soon
And I ask you what did you do, what did you do last night
While every one of us thinks we got it got it together
We're seekin' out things instead of comin' together
We need to focus on the things above cause the things below will never fill us up
We're movin, yeah we're movin (3 x)
We're movin', movin' out

Chorus: Tonight, can you hear us (hear us)
Tonight, we are waiting
Tonight, can you hear us (hear us)
Tonight, we are movin' out
Everybody always talkin' 'bout movement
Talkin' hype but theirr mouths can't prove it
Lackin' action and they try but they can't find traction
Cause their soul and their shoe is all worn out
And they're jumpin' for somethin' but they can't find the ground
Cause you see you, you and me
We gotta break the box that we live in
We're movin, yeah we're movin (3 x)
We're movin', movin' out
CHORUS
We are movin' out (we are movin' out) (3 x)
We are movin'
Can you hear us
We are waiting
Can you hear us
We are movin'
CHORUS
We are movin' out (7x)
(Can you hear us, tonight)
We are movin'
