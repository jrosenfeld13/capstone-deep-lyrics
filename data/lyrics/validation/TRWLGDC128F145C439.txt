You're strung out on cocaine every single day
You're whole life's in shambles in every single way
You smoke dope you rest checked you smoked all the rest (?)
You're diggin' in your pocket but you're money's almost spent

You come to the man and try to score on him (?)
Why don't you stop why don't you quit
Cause you're a crackhead
And that's all you'll ever be
You're a crackhead
And you're not thinking about me
You're a crackhead
And i wanna try to help
But you're a crackhead
You wanna do it all yourself

You started on first though but you hadn't really grew (?)
Stealin' from the corner store and mom and daddy too
You lost all of your faith you lost all of your friends (?)
You're tasted and your wasted and your high it never ends (?)
