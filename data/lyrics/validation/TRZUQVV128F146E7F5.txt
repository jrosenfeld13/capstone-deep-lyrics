[Verse 1:]
When every day is the same old routine
Be bold
Change it up
Kill monotony

I don't like to blend in with the crowd
I don't like to be quiet
I like it loud

I'm spontaneous, delirious
And all in between
Live like there's no tomorrow
Know what I mean?

[Chorus:]
I hate when things are simple and so plain
Don't wanna be the same
Cause I'm unpredictable
Unpredictable

I like when things are crazy and insane
Don't wanna be tame
Cause I'm unpredictable
Unpredictable

[Verse 2:]
I can't stand to be understandable
I can't control that I'm uncontrollable
Don't be so uptight
Just let it go
Do the unexpected
Or you'll never know

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Don't wanna be the same
Don't wanna be tame
I like when things are crazy and insane

Don't wanna be tame
And I hate when things
Are boring and mundane
Cause I don't
I don't wanna be the same

[Repeat Chorus:]
