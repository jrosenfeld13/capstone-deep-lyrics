[Verse 1]
Alright, I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do, I act cool
Just to test her, 'cause I'm no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Because I don't want to make my pal get rowdy
And doubt me, our friendship
But when lips touch, I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like a schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to, but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the boot denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

[Chorus 4X]
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

[Verse 2]
Another incident when I went way beyond
What I shoulda done
John shoulda stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't, ain't no quittin
Really didn't care whose girl I was hittin
I admit skins ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we gonna hold grudges? Well, oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear ya actions
Ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin that ho
Instead of tryin to front on me, ya know
That's exactly how I'm gonna be, ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin'
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the obscene do
When you call I screen you
Sorry, I didn't mean to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why do hoes be schemin', dreamin', actin' like demons?
My semen don't give a fuck because they beat skins
Too many girls front cute when they want loot
They tell lies, the swell guys
Can peep it, and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland, grew up bumpin' Too $hort
I know the rules on a flooze, so who's short
I once had a dunce ho, who smoked blunts, yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me, so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to, intervene through
Your relationship, and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

[Chorus]

Darling, I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

I'll work myself to death for you
Just to show I adore you
Nothing I wouldn't do for you

'Cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

All I ever, ever hope to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby, believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
I know darn well, I can tell, now

I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
Well, my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep

Siento una pena muy honda dentro del alma
Y quiero ahogarla con vino y caricias de amor
Mi vida no tiene remedio perdido ya estoy
En este medio maldito de amargura y dolor
Amor de cabaret que no es sincero
Amor de cabaret que se paga con dinero
Amor de cabaret que poco a poco me mata
Sin embargo yo quiero amor de cabaret
Amor de cabaret que no es sincero
Amor de cabaret que se paga con dinero
Amor de cabaret que poco a poco me mata
Sin embargo yo quiero amor de cabaret

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
She's got something

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
For a while

If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls

Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
With that something

When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something
She's got she's got something
Every girl is a something girl
She's got, she's got something
Every girl is a something girl
She's got, she's got something
Every girl is a something girl
She's got, she's got something
Every girl is a something girl
She's got, she's got something

I've just erased it's been a while, I've got a world for sale
And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me

[Voice in Background]
Look at the little porch monkeys, fuckin jiggaboo

[Master P talking]
My ancestor Kunta Kinte said
We come over to this bitch, smiling on a banana boat
(And they fucked our bitches and raped them)
They never told us what the fuck we came over here for
(Call us jiggaboos)
And did deals with the Indians
(Wild Coyotes)
Ain't no fuckin body ever did no deals with no black folks

[Chorus] x 4
We run away slaves
(Run nigga run)
They say we free then put guns to our head

[Master P]
Now the cops try to arrest me and these bitches wanna test me
My ??? scream P don't let the master get the best of me
The game got me crazy, I'm fucked up I can't sleep
They put dope on boats and planes and did deals with the enemy
That's us, some say in God we fuckin trust
The slavery's fuckin over but the world is messed up
Black on black crime, either you poor or you blind
Life is a welfare line and the homies they doin time
Some niggas they switch for a lighter sentence or they switch
The ghetto is a bitch, niggas live to get rich
Then they slam my fuckin dreams like b-ball
Killin chickens and pigs, just to feed the white hogs
No houses, no meals, no seven acres
Put us in the projects put us on dope and playa hate us
Now lady heroin steady gettin money
Ms. Cocoa leaf and weed, damn they gettin blunted
And my homies steady dyin, mothers steady cryin
I'm walkin the straight line keepin my people off the grind
Probation and parole, niggas in four doors
This ain't for the radio but you run away poor folks

[Chorus] x 4

[Master P talking]
For all the muthafuckin runaways out there
I mean all us niggas that been incarcerated by technology
By life, by the judicial system, (run nigga run)
By the white folks or even the black folks that think they white
(even the haters)
Martin Luther King was a run away slave
Jesse Jackson a run away slave
Malcom X, he was a run away slave
Mohammed, run away slave
Farrakhan, run away slave
Muthafuckin No Limit, we run away's (me Master P)
From the whole record industry
Cause we ain't bout havin 15 percent (I'm a runaway nigga)
We bout havin 100 (I'm about my paper)
We bout teachin other niggas how to get theirs
Cause we gon get ours (you got to)
Y'all get yours, stop hatin
Break away nigga (the media)
The chains is still there (y'all can't stop us)
And this mothafuckin black on black crime (yeah nigga)
It gotta stop (yeah nigga)
Run away slaves
That's just what they want us to do (but we gon go to college)
Nigga be all you can be if you a soldier
(we gon be doctors, we gon bepresident)
No Limit Army nigga (No Limit motha fuckin sports)
(We gon be rap stars)
We run away slaves nigga (Maurice Collins)
Takin over, we bringin our mothafuckin athletes home
(Leland Hardy, runaway slave boy)
And we keepin it real, we keepin it treal
(Sylvester Scott, Edward Hawkins)
No Limit, run away slaves (lawyers, politicians)
That's what we bout, keepin it treal, politickin nigga

There's a pink world
Comin' down
Yeah, there's a pink world
Comin' down
In a quite little village by the sea
I hear the calling and it calls for you and me
So leave your riches and your houses on the hills
Cancel all your credit cards and settle up your bills
Cause you won't need them anymore
Close down the factories
Blow up all the stores
Cause there's a pink world
Comin' down
Yeah, there's a pink world
Comin' down
Once I stood in new york city with a sign
Sayin', ""the end is comin', friends
Repent while there's still time""
I will admit that no one really seemed to hear
They would laugh and point their fingers
At my sandals and my beard
But now they'll listen when I say
I have proof, cause I read it in the supermarket today
There's a pink world
Comin' down
And it rolls like an avalanche
And it will sweep you away
Yes it rolls like an avalanche
And it will carry us away

Oh shit this chick is back and I'm freaking again
I need a man hung low and Indian
Hey, you, at the bar with the sexy grin
You may have bought me a drink but you're not my boyfriend

I want a man to do me like a robot, get it hot, don't stop, break me off 'til I hit the rooftop
Next up is Jason, Natalie, damn!
Did me so good i had to share you with my friends

Or baby I'm back but I'm switching it up
I need a lady with class that's ready to go
I need a girl like Janelle with a big bazonka
I can ride it like a train or a flying tonka

Wanna see Sheena get it? Give my panties a tug
Let me investigate, is this curtian scratching rug?
Got one or two thing to get off of my chest
I'm not a homewrecker I just got big breasts

So don't call me white, call me light-skinneded
I can double dutch slow, run it back and bend it
Meet me back at the crib, I'm a sexy baby
Roommate doing yoga but that dont phase me

Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold

Its like 11:30 and I'm ready to roll
Gonna sweat my weave out at the next toll
Gonna make a pit stop, you know how we do
Taco Bell, Post it up, we at the Drive-Thru

I could kill a burrito and a combo meal
But I'm at grad school, I only got a $5 Bill
Get a Mexican Pizza cuz I need to keep it thick
Can't wreck Gwen P. in the race for the biggest...

T-tapes, I'm known around the world for my, milk shakes
3 AM, Steak & Shake, mash, bake
Can you please order me cheese sticks and cheesecake?

If my cell phone rings, you know its Chelsea and she's bringing a bib cuz she's a messy baby
All these dudes in my ear, its nice to meet ya
But your lucky if you even get a slice of pizza

Give her mouth to mouth like bust to bust
Batteries not included like Toys R Us
Flip me like a pancake, you can serve me up
Sweet like syrup, bet you can't get enough

So don't call me white, call me light-skinneded
I can double dutch slow, run it back and bend it
Meet me back at the crib, I'm a sexy baby
Roomate doing yoga but that dont phase me

Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold

Break me off...blindfold
Break me off...ice cold

Break me off....ice cold
Break break me off

So let's take a little trip down Memory Lane
'tween he used to have a coon, now he rocks that fame
Just drive to his house, he leaves girl 14
And I laugh when he told her you got baby on the brain

Best waiter at the school of Jasnimak
Where the kids tote guns and you might get stabbed
Just cottage, and where I made that catch
Melissa B., over easy, like eggs with ham

Been my idol for 4 years now
Gotta listen for the music with your freestyle
So you know these writers got too much time on their hands
Your busy hating on me, I'm busy hitting on your man

I'm quite a busy bee like a moth on a farm
Call me swiss cheese G but I can pop in that thong
Ready to party like its fresh at the end
Get drunk on my ass like Britney Spears

Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold

Figgy shine (She fine)
Shake it down (shake it down)
Get yours, imma get mine (get mine)
I Can't (She can't)

Por tantas cosas que pasan
Por tantas cosas que no compartimos los dos
Por tanta indiferencia
Voy a tener que olvidarte
Por tantas cosas que llieren, tantas mentiras
Que nos decimos tu y yo
Por todo lo que a pasado
Voy a tener que olvidarte
Porque te quiero bastante
Voy a tener que irme de aqui
Te juro que no quisiera
Pero asi no podemos seguir
Tu dices que soy culpable
Yo digo que la culpable eres tu
No nos ponemos de acuerdo
Y siempre vivimos sufriendo
Hoy con el alma llorando
Y con imensa tristesa
Quiero espresar lo que siento
Lo digo con toda francesa

Voy a tener que olvidarte
Aunque te quiera bastante

Voy a tener que olvidarte, olividarte, olivdarte

Aunque te quiera bastante

Porque eres muy inconstante
Buscar un refugio lejos de ti
Aunque me mate le pena
A tu lado no puedo seguir
Ya no buscemos culpables
Sabemos que todo aqui se acabo
Esto no tiene remedio
Me marcho, me marcho

Little darling
Where you've been so long
I've been out here thinking about you
And the feeling's real strong
Well the time has come to celebrate
You and me girl so sounds great

Because tonight will be alright

Let's take a ride
To a midnight honey town and set it on fire
We don't want to be mad
But we have to be cool
You and me girl
Let's break all the rules

Oh my baby, I'm going to say it again
I can see us moving on
Down the highway
I can see us loving
Till our hearts desire
Anything you want to do girl
You just tell me

Because it's alright[x2]

Little darling, telling you no use

Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste
Like french cigarettes
And these coloured drinks
That you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

If you can imagine this
The whole world sharin' one big kiss
These are thoughts all through my brain
That I daydream every day
I'm alive and well
Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way
So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way
And we will live as one

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

What cannot will be done
For every living thing under the sun
Foggy color foggy race
Just be one big happy face
Among the sea of people
Live among God's creatures sharing love
That was sent down from above
Here to share with one another
Father, brother, sister, mother
Everybody sharing love
Sharing love

No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now

Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

I close my eyes
And everything will be alright
Here in my fantasy
Living in harmony
Make my dream come alive

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

The whole world sharin' one big kiss
Take away the pain and hurt
Make like heaven here on earth
Without reason to die
Givin' everlasting life to all
